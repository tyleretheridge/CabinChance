hello I'm Bob Gross and I'd like to welcome you to the twelfth of joy of painting series first of all let me thank you for inviting me back into your home's for another series of painting shows if this is your first time with us let me extend a personal invitation if you drag out your oil paints and brushes and paint along with this each week or just pull up the old easy chair and spend a relaxing half-hour with us as we play some of nature's masterpieces on canvas we'll use a few big brushes a dozen colors or so and I'll show you how easy it is to create some of the most fantastic paintings you've ever seen I'll take you step-by-step through each phase of the painting so you'll be able to create your own masterpieces at home so I tell you what let's go on up to the canvas here and get started now I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white and the liquid white just makes the canvas wet hmm it makes it slick and it allows us to actually blend color on the canvas so let's have run all the colors across the screen that you'll need to paint this painting with me and they'll come across in the same order that I have them on my palette starting with a titanium white and working around tell you what why they're doing that let's go on up here and get started today let's start with the old two inspiration we'll go into a little touch-up dark cien I think I'll just do a a warm little painting today that uses mostly Browns sort of a monochromatic type picture think you like that just a tiny bit of the brown little darks in our red on the brush just a little bit gasps go right up here now we use little little crisscross strokes and let's just put in a happy little sky I want a very very soft very pretty little sky and this is a simple little painting if this is your first time painting along with us I think you'll like this one I think you'll like this one because it works so easy and even if you've never painted before this one you can do there we go just make little crisscross strokes a little excess back and forth for now the color is continually mixing with the liquid white and it gets lighter and lighter and lighter as you blend it and then a landscape you want things to get lighter toward the horizon darker as they get closer to you and that helps create the illusion of distance in your painting there we go see how easy that is okay and you make it as dark as you want it as I say over and over again this piece of canvas is your world and you can do anything here that you want to do you have unlimited power when I go home the only thing I can say is yes ma'am but on this piece of canvas you can do anything that you want to do alright maybe we'll just bring it right on down here wherever you are there okay then I'll just use long horizontal strokes just to blend it out like so I mean it makes a super super soft little sky now then right up here I'm gonna have a little Sun in this I'm going to go right into a small touch of CAD yellow this is cadmium yellow in just a little tiny bit just the same old dirty brush just have a little touch of that red on the brush let's go right up here now maybe right in here we'll just still using those little crisscross strokes and working outward blending outward just putting a little touch of this yellow just like so we'll put a little Sun up in the sky and this will be the aura around this around the Sun very lightly blend it out now there and then we can put a Sun in here tell you what for that let's choose let's use the almighty finger here and I'll just put a little paint on my finger and right here figure out where you want the Sun to be all you have to do is just draw a little circle like so see and that easy yeah very lightly three hairs and some air just blend right over that it'll bring it all together and that easy Maddie you have happy little Sun I'll tell you what let's put a little cloud up here and for then I'll use a little fan brush it's number six fan brush will just tap a little the dark Sienna on there same color okay let's go right up here maybe maybe maybe right there it is right here lives a happy little cloud and I'm still using the same color that the sky it was just drop in a little cloud just sort of let it float around have fun clouds are one of the freest things in nature they just sort of they just sort of bounce around have fun all day maybe there's one right here be brave we'll let this one come right on out go right across there see there just like so maybe maybe there's another one here just however many you want just make a big decision to drop him in let's you see how easy they are you been making tiny little circular strokes okay then we'll go back to our large brush and very gently I'm just going to blend that a little bit love it that easy daddy you got a happy little cloud right there blend it I'm blending the base more dye on the top and then very lightly go over them so you can that easy you have a happy little little cloud in your sky and you're all ready now you can do this in any color that you want I've just sort of picked Browns today because that's a very nice warm color can go back into a little touch of the dark Sienna same old color and I'm just tapping the brush right into it maybe maybe we back here in the distance there's some little little foothills live just take the corner of the brush and very lightly touch the canvas and pull downward just pull it straight down straight down now put several layers in this one I think so the first one you want to be very light and then each layer after that will get darker and dark see they're straight down though that's all there is to it just sort of let it disappear now same color same color only when we get a little bit darker with the same exact color maybe now there's a little footy Hill that lives right here here I'm going to add a little bit more pressure to the brush so it's just a little bit darker and this one baby comes right on down wherever you want wherever just wherever you think these little foothills live so easy this is you really can do it even if you've never painted before it never picked up a brush you really can do this so let me show you a little trick a little trick here maybe you want to create the illusion that there's several layers here all you have to do is grab this same color still you can come right on down and makes the indication of like there's another another little foothill in front you can make layer after layer after layer the head easy okay you may be right under here I'm just going to take some straight straight titanium white and I picked up a clean brush I have several brushes going here so I don't have to wash them each time they use them it may be right in here it's going to pull down make it look like maybe just a little little body of water we back in the distance here straight down straight down and in go across it won't show too much now but the minute in a minute you'll see why that's there I think it'll be pretty and I'll take a little touch of that Brown on the knife let's just go right up in here and we'll make the indication of a happy little ripple here and there and maybe a little something right along in here just scrub it in very hard solvers to it okay add it back to the same old dark sienna but this time I will pick up a touch of the Van Dyck Brown and mix it in with it and just mix these on the brush don't worry about trying to mix them on a pallet just reach over here and take a little that and put it in there so we have dark sienna and Van Dyck Brown just tap it on the brush okay let's go right up in here now maybe maybe there lives a hill right here a little hill comes right down just wanders right on there boy sure does now see there and all you're doing is just tapping this in there we go this is where you begin to create the lay of the land to sort of decide how your land is going to how the angles are going to flow here and begin tapping following those basic angles and all you're doing here is just applying some base color will come back and highlight this this is only base color so don't worry about it you really cannot make a mistake here and as you know we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents you just have happy accidents and very quickly very quickly you learn how to how to work with anything that happens on canvas and that's really when you begin experiencing the joy of painting get in a little plug there so you start down here maybe in a work upward whichever way it doesn't matter this is where you take out all your frustrations and hostilities just really just beat this old canvas to death and I'm tapping quite firmly here once again all we're doing is putting in a base color we could really care less okay let's see already it's beginning to to show the way the land flows here there can just keep following those basic angles that you want okay and that quick you pretty well get it filled in okay now maybe tell you what get all fan brush again I'm gonna go right into the Van Dyck Brown grab a little bit of the dark sienna mostly Van Dyck Brown I'm looking for a little darker color now maybe here and there there's a happy little tree that lives back here so we just take the corner of the brush and I'm just going to give it a little upward push and we just this is one way of making just a happy little tree and all we're doing now is just putting in a little basic shading just decide how you want your little tree or Bush to look and just sort of push it in it's all there is to it so there's to it maybe tell you it may be there's another one and he lives right here same way just what push him in there decide where you want it drop you man I can't okay maybe he's got a friend right here don't want him to get along me everybody needs a friend even little tree so we'll just put him in a little tree right there little bush let's see how easy it is just I'm pushing upward with a brush to create all those little little grassy effects there okay now then let's use our one little brush this is the little script liner brush and I'm just going to dip it right into some paint thinner and I want to thin this paint till it's like ink a lot of paint thinner and then turn the brush turn it brings it to a very sharp point this is a script liner brush it has very long bristles okay let's go up here maybe maybe here and there there's a happy little tree it lives in here so by having very thin paint here on your brush this will literally just flow yeah we can put in all these little delicate looking limbs and branches so easy that is but you have to decide where they live and and put them wherever you on them there's another one say there or you just make all kinds of happy little things that easy to say there so I'm we're behind summer in front and these little things are what create they create interest in your painting and of course we're not interested in that happy bug but if you if you're out selling paintings this is what sells you paintings all these little details people like that they think you'd spent hours and hours and maybe even weeks working on this rascal and don't you tell them any different that's our secret there we go okay now maybe we want to put the indication of a little highlight here now use that same fan brush and put just a touch of the yellow ochre on just a touch and go up here and we just pop in the indication of a few little highlights here and there on some of those bushes just a few I don't want this to be too bright see and a little bit up here don't want this little bush to get upset cuz II don't have any highlights so we'll give him some too and we can just begin putting in a few little things back in here there we go okay maybe maybe we want to have a little tree or two this in front distinctly in front here so I have two you have your highlight then you come back and put in another one and once again in your world you put as many or as few of these as you want I just want to show you how we're not trying to teach you to copy when we when we bring you these shows we're trying to teach you a technique and turn you loose on the world because we eat see nature through different eyes and the way that you see it that's the way it should be painting that's the way it's right okay maybe one over here this there didn't get carried away with these and just pinned yo your whole time just as painting happy little tree branches and stuff okay it's enough for those for a while to have some fun here I'm going to a little of the CAD yellow little yellow ocher she would grab some Indian yellow just sort of mix them up on brush no more be right back reach up here and get a touch of white titanium white just tap it okay maybe right up in here we can begin adding just a little touch of highlight on this and all I'm doing is just tapping downward just tapping down right now if you have trouble making your paint stick add a tiny bit of paint thinner or the liquid white either what because we we start with a very firm base color here the paint that's on the canvas is very firm it's very dry so that way we can add layer after layer after layer of paint on top Oh without becoming a bud mixer but the only way you can do that is if each layer gets thinner and consistency it's the same consistency then you go and become a big mixer then you're going to be mad at me and I want this to work for you because it's fun there and you can really begin creating the lay of the land now I'll tell you what this do tell you if I mister this is a perfect place to have a happy little house list let's take the knife here take some band eang Brown pull it out from very flat take the knife and cut across they see you have a little roll of paint right out there just go up here maybe there's a little house it and it lives right there so we'll put part of the roof own come over in this side but the other part on is how easy that is put the side or the front depending which way you're looking at it and come over here all I'm doing now is just blocking in color we're just blocking in color see how easy it is to block in a happy little house now it takes some dark sienna and a little bit of Van Dyke to reach over here and get some white and we just mix that up till about like so we don't want to over mix it just leave it sort of marble and then cut across and get that little roll of paint again it's most important you load the knife correctly now let's go up here yeah we just touch and just let this run right down the roof bloop bloop bloop look see there gotta make a little noises or it don't work okay maybe a little bit there over here grab it pull down won't decide to be a little darker than that one cuz there is your light source so the little darker color here but just pull it down let it barely barely barely barely touch that the fabric and it makes it look like old wood okay just barely touch it there we go now you can take the knife here and cut it off you can do it you can do a cabin ectomy see here you just cut it off too any way that you wanted to get your perspective right and everything and that easy you got a cute little cabin let me get the small knife here maybe there's a couple little windows over here just take the little knife scrape down a couple happy little windows take a little midnight black patel's in shoot maybe maybe over here there's a window to however many windows you want just up to you that's how easy it is to make a little cabin now see home when you have a lot of time you can put little curtains into wind and just all those kinds of things alright yeah take the old two-inch brush here and I'll just tap in a little bit of the grassy stuff around his foot bring it all together and your little cabins just sitting right out there a little touch of white I just want to highlight this just a little bit so it's stand out you can see it better it's a little touch of highlight right down there make it edge stand out just looks it looks a little cuter this really stands out for you tell you hype let's take the old fan brush here I'm gonna dip it right into some liquid white we're going to the different yellows all the yellows all the yellows grab a little touch of dark Sienna throw it in there just load the breasts full little white okay but we've got CAD yellow Indian yellow yellow ochre all in the same brush and a lot of paint I can't go up in here I think we can begin just coming along in here and putting in some happy little grassy things and all of the lay of the land let it go just work in layers you can do it like this you can go it with a 2 inch brush 1 inch brush try them all see which one works the best for you all right so layer after layer after layer though it's a easy that yes it looks like a little feel tell you what tell you what must do I will take go right into some Van Dyck Brown here maybe right up and through here maybe it's just a happy little path comes right out comes right out there it comes there it comes Van Dyck Brown on the fan brush Lanta path come right out here say easy that yes I just disappears somewhere on back in here we don't know where it goes wherever you want it to go pick up a touch of the white just very lightly Grey's here and there just crazy just crazy target our back right there see what right on out around the corner put a little paint tenner on this pig brush I'm gonna go back into all the yellows here grab a little the white okay and then so you can do it with a fan brush or this brush whichever one try them both try to try tapping with this sometimes you'll find that works better sometimes you'll find it for some people the old fan brush works better so whichever way it's every way but you can just put a layer after layer after layer start the part this father's two way and work forward there stay there just keep going gentleman open here bring this right on down I've showed you several different ways you can make these little grassy things try them all once again sometimes the fan brush will work better for some people some people would like the a 2 inch brush better the one-inch brush works very well give them all a try get the effect that you want now then let me take here I got a little bit right here so we'll just take our fan brush and clean up the edges see that easy tell you what we need here let's build us up let's build us a tree we'll start with Van Dyck Brown pull it out flat cut across and we get that little roll of paint maybe our tree is going to live right oh right over other tree that's okay that's okay maybe he lives right there see there build him a trunk maybe he's got an arm lives right out through here wherever you wanted trees grow however about the other side on just like so so easy it is to make a tree only God can create a tree but you can paint one okay little bit of white and brown and let's put a little highlight on this tree I'm just touching just just touching just touching like so a little bit on this arm there we go manda let's go back to our script liner brush would take paint thinner thinner paint out I'm gonna put a little black and a little brown together make them dark but you need a lot of paint thinner on your brush to make this paint just like ink it's almost a water consistency all right now that must make some big decisions here maybe there's that there it is they garment comes out over here maybe this one goes up see there however you want to however you wanna just there's another one see maybe here oh there's another big alarm comes right now now if your paint will not flow like this add more thinner to it it doesn't flow it's just because it's not thin enough so just add some more thinner just add some more hmm see how easy that is if your paints the right consistency it'll just flow right off your brush and this liner brush has very long bristles so it holds a lot of paint you can just pop them little rascals right on there I get there no okay here's Owen and you can really take your time and put just hundreds of all these little limbs on here it'll make you it'll make your painting very interesting very nice just wherever you think they should live that's exactly where they should live can't tell you what lissa let's put a little maybe there's a little fence post set right here see right there just touch give it a little pull like so little touch a highlight on it loop like that like take that same old liner brush maybe there's a little bit of wire on there say still a little tiny bit of wire hanging on that rascal and I think with that without have a finish painting so let's sign this one I'll take a little red then it down with paint thinner and will sign this one right down here in the corner certainly hope you've enjoyed this one so very easy painting as I say if this is your first time painting along with us this is a good thing to do you'll have instant success and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and I'll see you next time you
