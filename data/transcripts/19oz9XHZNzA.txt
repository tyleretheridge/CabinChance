hi I'm glad to see you today today I thought we'd do the little animated opening the little painting that you see at the beginning of each show so tell you what let's have them put all the colors on the screen that you need to do this painting and let's go up here now I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white it's wet and slick and it's all ready to go so let's go to I'm going to start out today with a small amount of the Indian yellow tiniest little bit just tapped onto the brush just use a two inch brush let's go right in here put a little tiny tiny bit of yellow right along right along where you think the horizon will be we just drop that in just using a little crisscross strokes there you go put put some down in here this was a little snow saying so we put some colors down in the snow that it will be reflected from the sky okay without cleaning the brush I'm gonna go into a small amount of alizarin crimson just a small amount okay then back up here right above that yellowish color the Indian yellow still use a little crisscross strokes we'll just drop in a little a little bit of alizarin crimson let's sort of let them blend together right here where they come together all right and same color we'll just put a little bit down in here what will eventually be snow looks pretty already Thanks hand without cleaning the brush I'm going right into some of the midnight black just a very small amount and a little bit of phthalo blue tiniest little bit it's a very strong color both of these colors are very strong so don't get carried away an overdue it's real easy to add more color to use cavities the Sun are we going to try to take it away still using little crisscross patterns little X's will just just lay in its little sky shapes just sort of let them happen a little bit more right in there and you can just bring them have some little arms coming out here wherever wherever and you can put a little bit of that color down in here just here in there doesn't matter at this point this is really just a good way of cleaning the brush and speaking of cleaning the brush let's do that shake off the excess hmm that really is a fun part alright let's go up here now the clean dry brush and be very sure that your brush is dry as you can possibly get it and then still using the little crisscross strokes blend this entire sky together very gently and that's how the little sky is made it's a very effective little sky very quick very easy some nice little sky okay now then we want some little footy heels back here in the background so to make those I'm going right back into the midnight black a little bit of the blue I'm gonna reach over here and pick up a small amount of white titanium white so we have black blue and white okay and I'm just tapping a brush right into it okay let's go back up here make a big decision here where's your foot he'll live I think he is right there he was just the corner of the brush touch and pull it straight down and lay in your basic foothill shapes just sort of let him wander around you don't want him to be real straight foothills normally normally have little higher points and low points all kinds of happy little things that happen in there straight down we're not using much pressure on the brush here just enough to get the paint to come off okay now I'm gonna have two layers of foothills so we want to create a misty area in between each layer that's the only thing that separates these layers so with a clean dry two inch brush I'm gonna tap the base of this and I'm gonna strike it quite firmly apparently go see that that creates the illusion of mist down there just by tapping and then very gently lift upward just lift it up bring okay now we have a beautiful misty air you read along in there that's what I'm looking for now I'm gonna put another layer of foothills I'm gonna use the same colors a little bit of black a little bit of blue but this time I want it darker as things get closer to you in the landscape as we've said before they need to get a little darker just tap that brush in the color okay let's go up here now then here we go see now we don't want to kill all that little misty area that was in there that's the only thing that will separate these two entities it's only separator it's very important to you that your good friend don't kill it don't kill it there we're see that easy we have another layer of foothills and then we'll take a clean brush egg once again I want to tap the base of it just to treat that illusion of mist and then lift upward hmm and that a superb way to makes little foothills at a faraway and very soft and quiet and it works now then mad in this Assam fine I'm going to take some of the liquid white put on the pallet and we'll get a fan brush into the go to add a little bit of the phthalo blue on the brush and go right into the liquid white so it's a very thin paint very thin maybe reach over here to pick up a little bit more of the liquid white there we are okay now let's go up here I want to put some little indication of some happy little little bushes right here so all you have to do is just touch with a fan brush and pop upward just give it a little upward pop now this paints much thinner than what's own there so it'll just come right off your brush just like so that easy there we go minute with the washed little bit okay now it's time to start making some decisions back here and we start working forward so I'm going right into the titanium height and to that I'm going to add the least little touch of bright red let me see that again the least little touch it's very strong a lot of paint on the brush both sides are loaded full okay let's go back up here now we have to start thinking about the lay of the lamb so just grab that and begin begin pulling it now we want to create the illusion of shadows and highlights and warm and cool spots all through the snow back here there we go and every once in a while you can pick up a little bit of the but they lo blue a little bit and work it in there and it'll help create that illusion there's little hills and bumps and all kinds of things happening back in there there there's a little bit of pink right there it's a super super easy and very effective way of making some beautiful beautiful snow areas you can add a little bit of the Indian yellow here and there just just to make it shine because you'll reflect what's up here in the sky now you know the stories we've heard about yellow snow be careful don't get too much of it there we go and you can turn this into an extremely warm painting sometimes winter paintings are so cold that the flu they're not they're not much fun to look at I like to make winter scenes that are nice and warm and make you happy okay okay let's do something I'm gonna take it mix up we'll take some black and some blue a little bit of lizard crimson and just mix it with a knife and the least little touch of white into it titanium point there we go there good dark color okay let me wipe my knife off here Adam we'll take the old fan brush and load it full of paint just pull it through there give it a little wiggle sees a lot of pain in the bristles okay let's go up here maybe right back here lives I think we had a yeah we had a happy little evergreen that lived right there take just the corner of the brush and begin working back and forth I had a lady one of my classes she called these Z trees she says cuz all you're doing is going back and forth and making little diseased and I think that's a good analogy just sort of work it back and forth and you're forcing the bristles to bend downward see how you see how those bristles are bending and that makes all those little hanging down things that are under the limbs makes you tree look really nice we don't want him to get lonely you know I always always give them a little trees a friend because friends are so important I think they're even important to trees there we go hmm that quick we get a couple of happy little trees back here yeah we can take our fan brush it hit the white on it add a little blue to that load it for okay let's go back up here and let's put the indication that maybe there's a little snow hanging on like a tear just a little don't want to kill all that Dart cuz it's nice and contrasty helps make you a little tree stand out just put the indication of a little bit of snow there there we go okay maybe maybe there's a happy little weed that lives right there okay I'll wash off my old fan brush then we can begin going back into our snow colors and then reach right up in here grab under there I sort of pull that out and begin working with a lay of the land here look at that see you now you've set that tree right up on a little hill back here and that's where that little tree would be happy you know when you watch this beginning of the show it only takes about 30 seconds to see the whole thing but it takes a lot of fantastic people a long time to animate that they do have one frame at a time I couldn't believe it first time I saw I'm doing it really made me appreciate some of the some of the magic of television and we were very fortunate we work with the best crew in the country here there we go all kinds of other things happening okay I give this little background of some snow let's have some fun now let's go the old round brush can go right into some Van Dyck Brown a little bit of dark sienna and we're just gonna tap it into the bristles okay let's build some happy little trees maybe let's go right here maybe there's a little tree that lives right here little bushes and weaves they come right on out I don't know where they go wherever you want them to go that's where they go and I bet a bet we yeah well remember we had some on this side too so we'll just drop some right over here I like to start at the bottom on these trees and work upward that way that way the darkest color is at the bottom and it creates deeper shadows shadows on the base of the tree and all you looking for here is just some very basic little tree shape so we're not looking for a lot of detail yet detail will come later right now all we're looking for is just some happy little shapes let's put a few more in here on that very little thicker there we go that's getting pretty already I like these these little warm winter seems like they do nice things in here they make you happy okay a little little cleaner on my liner brush and we'll just pull it through some brown and turn that brush turn it and pull it out it brings it to a very sharp point there you can see it Jesco up here and in here I'm just gonna put the indication of a few little trunks it's just a few here and there most of them you won't ever see but should they show through it gives the painting some detail and that always is nice she has to hear in there wherever you think a little trunk should live to hold up all this trees and shrubs back here just drop it in drop it in shoot I'll tell you what let's do let's put some pretty colors on there we'll go right into some of the yellows here are some yellow ocher some CAD yellow little Indian yellow just tap this brush into it and the least little touch of the red least little touch okay let's go back up here now maybe maybe there's a tiny bit of highlight just playing right on the top of these just to create a little color in a few if you're off selling your paintings a lot of times people will buy your paintings because of the color more than the content because he they have a special place in their house that that that color combination just fit and warm colors are very popular right now I think maybe they're always popular people don't like to be cold maybe maybe right there there we go a little bit more of the bright red let's put a happy - the bush it lives right there and all I'm doing is just tapping with a top corner that brush that's really all I'm doing just barely touching now your paint has to be a little bit thinner than what's on the canvas if you want it to stick the yellows I user a little thinner than the other colors that way they stick easier and yellows normally always used as a highlight color there see just layer after layer after layer yes layer after layer okay yeah then we can go back to our fan brush and we can begin just running right up in here and grabbing this and pulling it out you don't care if a little bit of that brown color comes out into you snow that's the only thing worse than yellow snow there we go Oh fan it out but it makes it look like shadows okay and then over here on the other side maybe maybe we'll take some of those same little yellows just tapping and let's put a few highlights right on here you know we all do things we don't think about and sometimes are just automatic and the other day I was I was doing a demonstration for a fantastic group and a young man about all he was probably about 10 or 12 years old just walked behind me and I heard him saying how the corner of his mouth as he walked around me he says maybe maybe maybe so I could tell he'd been watching the show and I don't realize I'm doing that sometime but he made me aware of it so he was cute and he he brought in some fantastic paintings to show me then we recently did a show in Missouri and I had a young lady that was four years old bring me some paintings son-of-a-gun she was she was just fantastic four years old you know already she's a fantastic painter by the time she gets my age you know 22 she's really she's really gonna be something if you believe I'm 22 onna I want to sell you some land in Florida there hey tell you what let's do that painting had a little cabin in a happy little cabin so let's do one of those I'll start here with some Van Dyke Brown cut us off a little bit there see it's right out on the edge that night there you can see it real good cancel go up here start with the back of the cabin we'll give him a little back Eve like so now this may not be an exact duplicate of the painting that you see animated because you can never go back and do a painting this exact but it'll show you how that painting was done and you can do your own at home there say make the sign and then let me grab some height this is just straight titanium height touch and give him a happy little ruthless doll won't even freeze death got to give them a roof there and sometimes you'll find it's easier to scrape out the basic shape Spencer it helps remove some of that loose paint it's underneath put a little snow on the other side a little bit right down there take a little bit of the dark sienna and some white and let's put let's put some highlights on these boards to some highlights hmm makes it look like older wood a little bit of brown give him a door there then we can take just the point of the knife and create the illusionists and old slabs here this this cabins made with old boards a little bit of blue and white and we just put the indication on a little window right there that's really hard to see you but it's there okay now then let's go right up in here put a little snow coming right down through there all right and you can cut this off and put it wherever you want it and we'll take this is a little bit of fun oh the lizard crimson and a tiny bit of phthalo blue make a lavender color dark lavender color I will just put the indication of a little happy little path right here so he needs a little way to get out of this cabin then we can come back with a round brush go back into some of our yellows touch of the red tap them in let's go right here it will come right along here okay well let's we just let a few little bushes grow right up around the edge of his cabin that sort of sets it back into the painting and if I lived in this little cabin I I'd want to set back in the bushes and trees were where the salesmen couldn't find me I'd be hiding back here Hey yeah we can take a little bit of this titanium white and just sort of smooth that out on the bottom okay and easy now then we had a little fence so I'm gonna just dip my liner brush right into the liquid black that's the easiest way to make a little fancy just pull it down we just let it go right on back maybe it goes right on over the hill back here and there's still some still smooth fence things laying across there I can't go with liquid white we can come right back and lay a little bit of snow on there see in that super really gives you painting a lot of detail and when you're doing this at home you can you can just get crazy but all kinds of beautiful little things maybe we'll have this post come right behind the house we don't know where it goes that way there okay now then let's go over here play a little bit of the other side no I think we'll put some big bushes I'm tapping that same old round brush I haven't cleaned a chip right into the Browns again let's go up here and and and we're gonna have a great big tree all right over my pretty bushes back here this big tree oh he is a big trick he lives right here just start thinking about some basic shapes how you want you treat a look look at there big ole tree there he comes put this dark in so the light will show when you put it on there there is a happy little Bush this comes right on down yeah looks good already yeah then a little paint thinner right into the brown just really loaded brush full can you scale up here see and turn that brush when you're pulling it down turn it it helps helps make all kinds of old gnarly effects keeps your tree just from being a future telephone pole see and just drop all those little things in and we can take our round brush and right back into the yellows a little bit of the bright red just tap it okay and we'll go right up here see just just put the indication of a few little highlights just more colors in here there and as many or as few as you want just drop them in Danton had super that you can make all those little things that quick sometimes it's fun to go right into let's take a little bit of the blue and Hawaii mixed together and look at there we'll put one in it gives it a little bit of cold feeling maybe he's got a friend right there so mix a little cold in there with all that warm hmm just makes all kinds of beautiful little things happen there we go there's one right there and as many of them or as few as you want it's up to you painting painting gives you freedom gives you freedom and I think we are looking for that least I am there we go Oh cancel it oh happy thanks already let me lay that verse down and we go back go back to our old fan brush and and a little color in it we're just mixing between blue and a little pink and then we're gonna change this plane in other words I want this to go there you know in a different angle so it looks like it's overlapping what's back there just by changing the angles here you can create all kinds of fantastic illusions it doesn't matter once again if you pick up a little bit of that color it really really adds to your painting let's take a little bit of that this is just a little bit of blue and hide on the brush let's tap in a few little your little happy bushes and weeds coming right down like at bears what okay I tell you what as you know I like big old trees solicit Oh big ol tree I'm gonna go right in to Van Dyke Brown and pick up some of the midnight black and just mix them together Kent's go right up here maybe their lives a big tree oh he does now does now right there right there see big ol tree let's give him an arm hmm boy he is a big tree and all we're doing right now is just looking for a very basic shape very basic shape and we can take a look at the Browns and line this is dark sand and white and let's just put the indication of some nice little highlights here just hearing her Josh Turner like so careful I get the old knife going here a few little fences post we had I think in that one little white thanks so I'm gonna take the old liner brush and we'll put the indication of a of a happy little lamb here and there and the old clock tells me it's time to leave for this week so I hope you've enjoyed this one I hope you enjoyed seeing it at the beginning of each Hill and until next time I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless you
