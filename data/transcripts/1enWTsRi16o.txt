- Hello, I'm Bob Ross. And I'd like to welcome you to the 19th of Joy of Painting series. If this is your first time with
us, let me extend a personal invitation for you to drag
out your old paint brush and spend a relaxing half
hour with us each week as we put some of nature's
masterpieces on canvas here. And if you've been with us
before, let me thank you for inviting me back for another
series of painting shows. And I hope we continue to
produce shows that you enjoy and that you learn from. So I'll tell you what,
let's get right to it. Let's start out today and
have them write all the colors across the screen that
you need to paint this little painting with me. While they are doing that,
let me tell you what I've already got going up here. We have our standard old
18 by 24 inch canvas, but you use any size that you want. And we've covered it
with a thin, even coat of liquid white, just
enough to make it wet. This is a wet on wet painting technique, so the first thing we normally
do is make the canvas wet. So, thought today, it's
such a fantastic day, let's just do a beautiful
little, do a little winter scene today and Ill show
you how simple it is to make a painting with a
little tiny brush that you can do at home on your first attempt. So, let's make a very
colorful little scene, let me take a little Indian Yellow. We'll use a little two inch brush here, and we'll just dab a little color onto it, just a very small amount of color. And we'll just start out
and we just sort of dance a little color in the sky here and there. Sometimes winter scenes can be so cold, they are almost displeasing,
so I thought we'd do one today that had a lot of, a
lot of very nice little colors in it, take a little Indian
Yellow, now mix a little Cad Yellow with it, too. Then we just mix them
together on the brush so we have both colors
on the two inch brush. Very little paint, very very little paint. We just take, and we dance
a little dab in there, the yellow ochre is sort of a gold color. So it will just change
the flavor a little bit. And all we're doing is
just dancing a little color here and there. Here and there. And just sort of let your
imagination take you wherever you want to be and just enjoy. Now then. Maybe, without cleaning
the brush, we'll go into a very small amount of
the alizarin crimson. Very very small amount. There. Now then. Maybe here and there,
we'll just add a little bit of the alizarin crimson
and this will just give it a little pinkish warm glow. It will make your painting sparkle. A little more of the color and what you do in your
painting, you sort of look around and decide
where you want all these little colors to be. And the more you blend them
together, the more you'll get a little color that's
sort of like peach. That's a nice way of calling it. Just peachy color. There. Ok. Then maybe just a little touch more. And as I say, just let your
brush dance around and play and have fun and enjoy. Enjoy. There. And you take it down to about, like so. Anything that we don't like
in this painting technique, we just cover it up. We don't do any tracing
or drawing or anything like that, though you
can if you would like. Some people prefer to trace
a scene onto the canvas and then paint on it. And you can do that. The liquid white will allow
you do see your painting or your tracing through the liquid white and you can do that, if you would like. There we are, I'm gonna put
just a touch more of that crimson right there, I want
just a little more of this peach color that we have in here. Like so. There, and just blend it together. The more you blend this,
the softer it will become. Til it just, eventually,
just blends totally together. And when you're doing this
type of painting, just sort of, sort of visualize a scene in your mind and let it go. If you can see it here,
then you can put it up here, but the first thing
is that you need to believe that you can do it. You need to see that vision in your mind. Let's have some fun today,
we'll take a little bit of red, I'm gonna go right up here and to the midnight black. Little bright red, little midnight black. Very, very small amount of color though. Very small amount of color. And all I'm doing is just
tapping the corner of the brush into them. Very, very small amount of color. And I have not cleaned
the brush so it still has the yellows in it, crimson on it. There, maybe we back in our world here, there's some little trees
that live far far away. And we'll just use this two
inch brush we got it going, you can do this with your round brush or, you know, with a one inch brush. We have this one going,
so we'll just use it. Now, I want these to be
very light, because they are far, far away. They live way back in the mist. These are just beautiful
little tree shapes that, they're back there,
but they're very far away. And we'll sort of vary the
color, we'll add a little more black, a little more red here and there. There. But think about basic
little tree shapes here, don't just hit at random. Think about how you
want your tree to look. See there? But very gentle. Very gentle. Almost, almost no color on the canvas. And that's what helps create that illusion of distance and depth in your painting. As things get closer
to you in a landscape, they should get darker
and darker in color. There, let's go up here to the top corner. Maybe up in here there's a,
maybe there is a big tree that lives way up here that
you just barely can make out. This very quite little tree, very subdued. There. Ok, same color, we'll just
use the same old color. Little of bright red, little
bit of black, just the corner of the brush, but a touch
more paint this time. And that way, automatically,
it will become darker and we can come right up
here, see, and because that's a darker, it will create
that illusion that this bush is in front of that bush. And that's exactly what we're looking for. Let me get a little more color. There we are. You can just build layer
after layer after layer here. There. Ain't that fantastic? Thought you'd like that. Add a little bit of dark
sienna, a little van dyke brown into that now. We're getting a little
closer, so maybe we're getting it to some of
these other core colors. There. But all we're doing is just
tapping with the top corner of the brush and putting in
some very basic little shapes. But each layer gets progressively darker. Progressively darker. Maybe over here, yeah,
you're right, you're right. Here lives another happy little bush. And in our world, everything is happy. Everything is peaceful and
quiet and gentle. No violence. This is a very nice place to be here. As I say, everything is happy here. If you wanna see bad
things, watch the news. There we go. There is another little bush,
little more of the bright red in this one, just to sparkle it up some. By varying these colors back
and forth, it just makes your painting more interesting. Just more interesting. Now back into, watch here,
if we put a dark color right into that, look there. See, creates another layer,
just by changing the value of the color. And you can put as many layers
in your painting as you want. Just sort of, sort of let your
imagination go and take you wherever you wanna be. Cause in this piece of
canvas, you have absolute and total control, here, you
can do anything that you want. You can create any illusion
that you want in this world. Any illusion that you want. And if you ever, if you
put something up here and you want it to be softer,
all you have to do is tap it. And it will blend with the
liquid white that's on the canvas and automatically, automatically,
it will become lighter and lighter in value. There is a happy little bush,
right there, right there. Look at that. Ok, maybe a little more
of the van dyke brown and dark sienna and just mix together, just to change the flavor
a little here and there. Big hair layin' there. Just take the corner of
your brush and pop it off. Alright. If we're not
careful, we're gonna fill up this whole canvas with
bushes, and that's alright. That's a super, super way to learn. Super way to learn. Tell you what, let's put a
few little sticks and twigs and some trunks on some of those trees and we'll use a lighter
brush for that, get a little paint thinner, little paint thinner. And we'll go right into
the same color that we made the bushes out of. We'll start with just a little
black, little bit of the red but not much. Turn the brush, that brings
it to a very sharp point. This is a script planner brush, number two script planner brush. It has very long brussels and it comes to a very very sharp point. And it holds a lot of paint,
so you can literally make it flow and we thin the
paint 'til it's like an ink, almost a water-like consistency. And that way it'll flow
right over the sticker paints without mixing. And if it mixes, then
you become a mud mixer and you won't be happy with me. So if you have trouble making it flow, all you need to do is
add a little more of the paint thinner and you
can just begin putting in all kinds of little sticks
and twigs and things that live way back here in some of these, sort of let it flow. Let your hand just sort of
jerk, if you have a little nervous twit, this is
one time that it really, it'll be beneficial to you. It will help you out. There. I have people write sometime
and they say that their hand shakes a little and they're
having a hard time to, this is, this is your
thing right here, enjoy it. Ok, just wherever you
think they should live. Just begin dropping in
all kinds of little deals, twigs and sticks, and
maybe even here and there there are some that come right on up here, maybe this whole tree
lost all of its foliage. There. But this helps create that
illusion of depth and distance in your painting. There we go, there is one. Put a little one in here. Some people will find
it's easier to pull down to make these, others
will find that it's easier to go up. Try both ways and whichever
way seems to work the best for you, then that's the right way. The only rule that we
have here is that it makes you happy and that you
enjoy what you're doing. I wanna add a little
van dyke brown to color and as we get down here
in these darker things, we need some little branches
that are a little darker. Same color, with a little van
dyke brown added to it. There. Maybe, shoot, I tell you
what, maybe right here, lives a big one, there he goes, up up up. That's your bravery test. He's a bigger one, he
stands up here and watches everything that's happening. Enjoys life. There. Maybe he's the old papa tree and these are all of his kids. See there? Ok, good. Few more little, little
doers here and there. Ok, always lot of little sticks
and twigs out in the woods. So you can just put as
many or as few as you want in your world. There, one right there. And we said this was
gonna be a winter scene, so we need to begin to
thinking about some snow and that maybe, there, wash the old brush, and we wash our brushes
with just odorless thinner and I just wipe them on a paper towel. Tell you what, I've got several
of each brush going here, let's take, let's take a little
touch of that bright red, little bit of the black. We just put a little undercolor. We're gonna have snow here. Let's just put in something
that will, maybe just end up being shadows, basically,
but a little color into here. Little show thorough, it'll
make your, make your painting a little more interesting. Once again, because you
have liquid white on here, this color blends with it and
all these beautiful things will just happen automatically. Now we use a clean brush,
this clean two inch brush and we'll go right into titanium white. And we just load some color
on both sides of the brussels. A little bit of color and if
you want to put the indication maybe of a little sunshine,
we'll take, be right back the least little touch of
the bright red in there. Least little touch, tiny tiny little bit. It'll set your whole world
on fire in a heart beat. Very, very little color. But see this, there is quite a
bit of paint on the brussels. And you just pull it. And this is a very thick, firm, dry paint, so you can see how hard I'm pulling the brussels through there. Load your color, ok, let's
go up to the canvas now. Had to make some big
decisions, where does your snow live in this world? Maybe, right here, see there? Just pull it and think about
the angles that you want in here. Think about shape and form and where you want all
these little things to be. Look at there. Gonna reach up here and
get the least little touch of phthalo blue, least little touch. Put a little, a little
cool shadow in there. Blue is an extremely cool color and this little shadow,
it'll make your snow look just a little bit cooler. Little bit, but be very
very sparing with it. A little bit goes a long way. Didn't take long to cover
up your whole world. Now, very gently, you
can take and pull that and we can blend it
together 'til it's just as smooth as silk. But always pull in an
angle, think about the lay of the land, the way the
land's gonna flow here. That's most, most important
when you're doing things like, yes it creates that shape that
you're looking for. There. Now maybe, if you take
pure white and we can make a nice distinct little thing, so you have that one stands out. So any time you wanna have
one, go back to nice pure color if you wanna show a, like
a hill or a bump in there. Alright. Maybe. Tell you what, let's have some fun. Shoot. Sometimes it's nice just
to get a little bit crazy. Maybe there is a little water right here. You know me, if you've
painted with me before, I'm an absolute fanatic for water. I love water. Absolutely love it, and it's
one of the nicest things that happens in this technique. Let's take a little
bit of that bright red, a little touch of the black,
we'll just mix them together on the brush, be right back, right back, there we go, little red,
little black, but mix them on the brush, that way you
have a multitude of things happening on the, right on the brussels. You don't have to worry about trying to mix all these colors. See? There's a whole
bunch of things happening. Let's go up here. Now if we wanna have water,
you need a reflection here. So all you have to do is
take your two inch brush, or one inch, whatever you wanna use, decide where your snow
ends and your water starts and begin pulling straight down. Most important though that
it come straight down. See there? Straight down. Little more of the color,
little red, little black, see? Just make that big
decision, where it lives. And drop it in. You could even add the least
little touch of phthalo blue in there, just enough to
cool it down a little. Here and there. I don't want a lot of blue in there. I want it to reflect what's up above. Here and there you can
take a little touch of the, least little touch of the yellow ochre. Don't let it touch the blue though, or you'll end up with green water. And usually that will disturb you in a winter picture. Now then. With a nice clean brush, we
take and come straight across. Right across, it'll create that illusion of reflections instantly. Instantly. That easy. But it's important to go
straight across with these brush strokes, if you
don't, it's gonna look like your water is tilted. Then we take our brush
that has the white on it. And we can redefine some
of these edges here if you wanna make them a little more distinct. See there? And you can pull little
panenthelas of land out or push them back, whatever you like. Now then, take a little
touch of the liquid white. We'll just use the old knife
and we'll add a little, little bit of the titanium white to it. One of our golden rules
in this style of painting, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So we're gonna start
out where the paint here is a little thinner than
what we have on the canvas. Let me wipe the knife off,
you can see it close here. I'm just gonna take and pull across and get a little tiny role
of paint right on the edge of the knife. Once again, this is liquid
white and titanium white. The liquid white is only
to make the titanium white a little thinner. Then we can go right up here
and literally just cut in like a little water line,
a little bit of snow laying out here on the water. Push firmly. Really push firmly. This is where you take
out all your frustrations and hostilities and everything. But it cleans up the edge,
brings everything together and gives you the little
water line out here. There we go. Ain't that something? And you can do that. You can do that. Even if you've never painted before. Now, tell you what, maybe in our world, maybe there are some large
trees that live out here. Clean off a little spot to work. We'll take some van dyke
brown, just pull it out as flat as we can get it, go straight down with a knife and we'll cut
us off a little roll of paint that's right out of the edge of the blade. Let's go right up here. Now then, you have to make a big decision. Where does a tree live? Just sort of, look, make a
determination of where you want him in your world. I'll show you couple of ways here you can make these. We can make them using the knife. We're just using van dyke brown. Excuse my arm a second,
I'll come over here and do the other side. And all you're doing is
putting an undercolor, a base color. All we're doing at this point. Now then, maybe, maybe you're in a hurry. Sometimes we do get in a hurry. You could do this same thing, watch here. Watch here, you can take
a fan brush, load it full of the same color, and maybe you want another little tree, lives right there. Now this one is a little thicker, and when it dries, it'll
feel like it, like it has real bark on it. Maybe there is one right here, watch here, maybe this one here got stepped on, it was little and this got a
little, a little yaha in it. See, a little crook. Little crook. This is a crooked tree right here. And sometimes it's nice
just to put some little trees in there that are little different. Now then we'll take a
little of the titanium white and once again, we'll pull
it out as flat as we can get it and cut off our
little roll of paint and let's go right up here. Our light's coming from the
left, maybe on this one, let's touch and just give it
a little pull, little pull. And we can instantly turn
these into some very nice, little birch trees. Just some happy little
birch trees live out here. And this one here. Put him right in. I already think I prefer
the ones made with a knife, because, once again, when they
dry, they're nice and thick they actually feel like a real tree. Now, the ones will be much smoother. This one here, it's got the old bandini. So it's sort of a, it's
a matter of choice. Decide what you want in
your world and drop it in. We'll try to show you how to do this. That's all we're gonna do. What you do is up to you, because painting is as individual as people are. And that, I never tried
to get you to copy exactly what we're doing here, I'd
really rather teach you a technique and let you do
whatever makes you happy. Take a little bit of the paint
there, little van dyke brown on the liner brush, lot of color. Let's go right up here. Maybe there's some limbs
on these old trees here. There. See? But with this thin paint,
it should just flow. And if it doesn't flow, add
a little more of the thinner. And you have to make big decisions. Which tree lives in the
front, which tree lives in the back? There we are. See, and just put as many or
as few limbs in your world as you want. There we go. Maybe there's someone up here. Wherever you want them. There. While we're up here, we'll do this one. We don't want him left out. There, and have some come
up and across the trunk, don't have them all just
coming out the side, it'll give the impression
that big giant came along with a huge razor blade and
cut them off and there's no limbs going across, that
they're all just on each side, so let them come across, some go behind, then it looks natural. There. Study trees, make friends with them, there's nothing wrong if
you're a painter going out in the yard and talking to a tree. You know, people are looking
at you like you're a little strange, but painters are
expected to be a little different, so you do whatever makes you happy and by talking to a tree
or just studying a tree, you don't actually have
to go talk to a tree. It helps you understand
how the old tree grows. Maybe down here, there's
a little baby one. See there? Now, I'll just use that same little brush and go down here with
a little of the white, clean up these little foots,
so it all comes together. There we are. Now then, maybe over
here on the other side. Let's come right down here,
maybe, let's have a little, little (mumbles) right out here. Put that little bank, then we need a, we need that reflection underneath it. So you put it in and then bring... Maybe there is another layer right there. That easy. Back turn knife, little
bit of that liquid white that's been added to the titanium white, come right in there. Little tiny water, maybe there
is a different kind of tree on the other side. Shoot, we got a minute or so left here, let's have some fun. Maybe this whole tree lives right here, we'll just use a liner
brush, just get wiggledy. Let's get wiggledy here. Maybe this old tree lives right there. A lot of paint thinner, though. Maybe he's got a big old arm. There it is. Just right out there. And you make this tree as big or small as you want it, just sort
of look at your painting and decide what you think,
what'd look good in it. Whatever you think, there we are. Ok, now that little arm right here, there. And you can put hundreds
of little branches on your tree, or you can just have a few. It's really up to you, really up to you. There we are. It's hard to believe that
this is the 19th series, there's 13 shows in each series, phew. Have to get my calculator
out, that's a bunch of shows. And I certainly thank you for
inviting me back for another one of these. There maybe there's another
little stick lives right here, wherever you want them. And just use some little weeds
and stuff for around here. Now then. You wanna get crazy? Maybe in our world, maybe
it's snowing a little bit. I'm gonna take a little
bit of the liquid white, little paint thinner,
lay the palette down, I need two hands here,
want this paint to be very very thin. And we can take, we'll
use a knife, very lightly, you might practice this a
couple times before you do it, but, just take the brush and
flick it, just like salt. Just like salt, see there, and
you can create the indication that it's snowing. And it softens this whole
painting, makes it very very nice, and you can put as
much or as little snow in your world as you want. That easy though, you
can create that illusion. Ain't that fantastic? Shoot, I think we're that,
we're just about to have a finished painting. Take a little bit of the
red on the liner brush and let's sign this little rascal. I hope you've enjoyed it. This is a very nice painting. If you've never painted
before, this is one that you can do that I think you'll enjoy it. So I'll tell you what. From all of us here, I'd like to issue, happy painting, and God bless, my friend.
