come back I'm certainly glad you could join me for this the last show of the tenth joy of painting series so I tell you what let's start off them have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let's go on up here we have our standard Oh 18 by 24 inch canvas it's covered with a nice thin even coat of liquid white it's all slick and wet and it's it's ready to go so let's start I'm going to start out today with some phthalo blue on the brush just tap the brush right into the blue just tap it in like so okay let's go right up here let's build us a happy little sky we just take this blue we'll make some little crisscross strokes like so maybe we'll leave some areas open well you'll have some fun you'll play a little bit just leave them open to that blue I'm gonna add the least little touch of midnight black just want to there yeah make a little darker in places there we go blue little touch of black there we are now the color is automatically blending with liquid white it gets lighter and lighter and lighter down here toward the horizon and that's exactly what we're looking for okay now then all we have that on the brush goodwill blue in the brush let's come right down here and this put I'm gonna be a little water down here let's start right down here okay come across this way we'll have a little water down the bottom of this painting what's the devil oh you can do that if we want something about like so okay let me wash the brush and we wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner shake off the excess let's beat the devil out of all right now with a clean brush we go back in here very gently just blend just blend just like so see those areas we left now our nice little light areas we could stop right there and have a nice cloud looking effects in the sky maybe we'll make a happy little cloud today there here we just blend in the pain out and very lightly we'll go across it to take out the brushstrokes and down here same thing all the way across a little light area that we left it remains right there it looks like a little little sheen of light it's gonna be playing across the water when you're done okay and we can wash your brush again that's the fun part of this take out all your frustrations and hostilities just like that okay happy little clouds we'll grab a one-inch brush and let's go right into titanium white just pull that brush right through there we can even go down here and get a the least little touch of the bright red Lee's to the least little touch don't get don't get crazy with it it's very strong a lot of pain in the brush gets go up here yeah we're gonna have a cloud that lives right here let's just go right in here using a little circles you could do this with a fan brush or the 2 inch brush whatever I just happen to pick up this one and that's just layin all kinds of beautiful little clouds just sort of let your imagination go crazy just think like a cloud just float around the sky have a good time that's off when you're doing it's just just sort of relax and be calm peaceful enjoy the life just really really should should bring you a lot of a lot of good feelings here should make you happy painting should really make you happy it doesn't make you happy that you're doing the wrong thing there we go this shoot just put another layer here just make a decision how many clouds you won't drop them in no big deal might even put one up here that'll give you a lot of practice if if there's a secret to this it's practice just practice anything that you want to be good at you practice and it's the same with painting the more you practice it easier it gets more fun you have with it pretty soon you don't even have to think about how you're loading the brushes or oh because you know what's gonna happen all you have to think about is composition and effects that's why it really becomes fun when you're no longer you no longer had spend all your thinking time thinking about how do I load this brush or how talu tonight that will become automatic here I'm just blending take out the little brush strokes corner the brush just sort of wind this up mix it up just mix don't overdo don't overdo you blend too much they'll just they'll just disappear then go and leave you you'll be sitting there all by yourself but if that happens you go right back and drop them right back in its no no problem at all lift up let's just sort of fluff some makes those nice little fluffy edges just Bluffs a lot look at that got a super nice easy way to make some fantastic little clouds and I beat the brush just to knock the excess paint off of it mm so I'm lazy and it's easier than cleaning the brush all over again okay here we go got a beautiful little sky that quick I knew you could do it there we are yeah we can wash your brush just shake it off okay we're in business now let's see today let's use the old round brush I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyck Brown some dark sienna she would grab a touch of this pression blue just a touch because it's very strong so we get both Browns and little pression blue there it is now then had to make some decisions maybe we'll have a yep let's have a little happy little tree that lives right here on the corner want to do maybe maybe we'll do a little little country scene today there we are so I've had a lot of the trees back here this round brush is super super for doing little background trees see but I start at the bottom and work up word that way it gets lighter and lighter and lighter as it goes up so the dark area down here is where all the shadows are down here not as much light we'll get through so you want that darker so by starting there and working up your brushes your brush is just running out of paint that's all just make a decision look at there a tree this cruel of me just grows and grows and just however many trees you want in your work that's how many there should be the heads how many there should be maybe right here do you knew that too didn't you okay well we got tree city right here in a matter of minutes literally just about fill all this in with with color I'm tapping quite firmly you can probably hear that it's really tapping quite firm in here we said there was going to be some water but don't worry about anything it comes down here shoot we just turn it into reflections don't worry about no a big deal at all we can we can fix any other thing that happens some of the instructional video takes we make we show how to correct as well as how to make these things and that's to be able to correct as is probably as important is being able to paint so we devote a lot of lot of energy to showing you how to do that alright and take the liner brush little paint thinner on it and I want to thin this paint till it's like water turn that brush and pull it out to a nice sharp point look at the eye see how sharp it is good let's go up here now here and there we're going to put in the indication of a little tree trunk wherever wherever there is what and maybe there's some out here no no worry just there just relax and joy let's just sort of let this happen no think like a tree there we go little more thinner anytime your paint won't just slide right off the brush add some more thinner then paint will stick to a thick paint then the thick okay that gives us an indication of a lot of happy little trees out there tell you what let's take I'm going to go right in to use the same old dirty brush I'll go right into some midnight black and then some yellow tap that brush tap it load a lot of paint same old dirty brush I'm using the color it's already in the brush to mix with this there was a little bit of blue and that so that helps it turn green there okay now right up here let's go start here just touch and let all those little sparklers just jump right off the brush just here's a little one right there working layers work in layers there we go round brush just us with fantastic things sink make individual trees back here we can dip into a little yellow ochre little Indian yellow then here and there I'm gonna jump on the bright red there's another little bush well he's a pretty little bit of a mess right there there we go baby out here there's another one here's a little piece over here so you think about the limbs projecting out and causing see there's little clumps here there's just not a solid green vest they're not just hit at random see look at the shapes pay particular attention to the shapes when you're doing these don't just don't us hit it random think about what you're doing look at them look at the trees in new yard take a trip to the woods go out and talk to a tree make friends with it so you look at all the little layers of stuff there we go they're just all kinds of little things happening there we'll put another one right in there that ones get a little more red at it just really jumps out at you pretty little rascal Purdy little rascal just layer after layer after layer okay I'm just wandering all over here just drop it all kinds in maybe there's one right here I'm not careful I'm gonna cover up everything I said was gonna be water I get carried away these little rascals are so much fun to make and they're so pretty sometimes I just get carried away until going to stop okay let's come right in here this is gonna be water let's grab this and turn it into reflections pull it straight down straight down straight down my cab see there that fantastic now go across and that easy you have instant instant reflections so very very simple we just use that same old brush I'm going right into some of the Browns again let's just let's just lay in a little bit of color here we can begin creating all kinds of happy little things he's just the Browns least little touch of Prussian blue but not much mostly Browns just all kinds of things going on there here we go see we just throw this on like yet it doesn't make me very here is just color just applying color to the canvas you could really put it on with a paint roller if you wanted to we'll start a whole new style of painting there we go in that quick we got the canvas all covered up and it's ready and then if we want reflections just decide where the little land masses are gonna be pull it down go across maybe under here see there see there that easy you can create all kinds of little peninsulas little projections out into the water whatever whatever go back to my round brush get a little color on it let's put a happy little Bush right about there there we go I know I know what let's do out here on this little body of water let's build us a little cabin just a tiny little house it's out here we'll take Van Dyke Brown let's go right up in here and decide where our house is gonna live if he's right here touch and pull just give it a little pull there we go like that over on this side all we're doing right now is just blocking in color so we don't care just blocking in color a little place to go and hide everything gets too hectic and go out here just just have a good time by yourself listen to the birds take some red a little dark sienna maybe the least little touch of white into that whoo nice color maybe a little more red there we go okay let's go out up here will this sort of a rust color roof maybe had a tin roof rusted Oni okay a little touch of that color right down the other side of the roof there we go now that's the least little touch of a light color see just enough to make that stand out so you can see it will Lee's little mount let's get the small knife we'll take some white touch midnight black into it there we are pull it out very flat cut across and once again we have our little roll of paint let's go up here touch it pull it straight down this is just sort of a grayish color and the more you pull it see it's going to pick up that Brown so you can take it to any degree that you want it to be now then on the other side I want it a little darker so I'll use the same color and add a little more black to it see pull it out once again that's a little roll of paint this is a small knife see it sneaks up in these little areas or just right up in there and it's a little bit more flexible we're flexible Kate tell you what let's fire the little brown and we'll give him the door we'll put the door over here you put the door anywhere you want it on your cabin take a little white just go right around the edges sort of outline it maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe right there is a window little brown and there's another window it looks like two big eyes looking at you this is a Halloween house now chop off the bottom we'll do a little to a house ectomy right there yeah that must be a Halloween house okay where's my fan brush there it hides I'll take a little yellow the yellow reach up here and grab a little black that'll make a beautiful green color just work it right in right into the brush I'll pick up a yellow ocher to a lot of color just go up here now we can go back here and begin pushing up some flies nice little nice little grassy areas right around the house see just give it a little upward push just a little upward push that easy there we go we can just make all kinds of little grass areas look at that look at that I will use the other side to brush see what we left there let's use the little knife and we'll sneak right back up in here you will make that a little pass we can come down here and you can come down here and catch that big fish it lives over here there we go all right okay over here we're putting us a happy little grassy areas like so just wherever you want I take you what there's a nice one tell you what do you want to see maybe that's just a perfect place to have a little path so let's do that let's do that you know I'm putting this little path in some of the questions that we get asked over and over probably one of the most common questions that are here is is there any editing done to the shows all the time I could ask do you actually paint the pictures as quick or is it video magic there is no editing absolutely no what you see is what happened even the mistakes they're in there - there is no editing at all none whatsoever sometimes maybe better there was but I think that's what I like about this it's very spontaneous and we just do it okay a little brown and white here and I'm going to go back and just put the indication of a least a little bit of least a little bit of highlight right along there okay that easy we got a little path now then to push that path into the painting let me grab a little more of the black the yellow make some green now then let's begin bringing some grassy areas down into the path that will help set the path down into the painting make it look like it belongs there and not many people come down this path of Bush using the grasses about I'll have to reclaim it a couple more years and you won't be able to find this one if you don't use it nature comes and takes it back - lemur comes right on out just all kinds of little things there see that easy easy bow by making this go upward it'll look like here's a little little bump there change the lay of the land so it's not all just flat maybe this path sets down it in a recessed area so just by see how that goes around little simple things like yet keep your painting from being boring there we go use these little things to your advantage yeah then we can take the knife and here and there just scratch in a stick or two and usually in the dark areas okay and some of them come right over the path I hope you'll see those there there sometimes they're hard to see I'll turn out this way and like I'm not bigger so they stand se there we go and back in here even you might see a few little things now then let's take a little a little brown and write up in here that would go up this one maybe there's some little areas like so like so this is here I'm just using the small knife put a brown and white we can come back and make it look like there's a few little stones and rocks of all kinds of happy things a little liquid white pull it out very flat and let's come along here put a send a little water line right on back here just a little water line right here this sort of cleans up the bottom and and gives you a division breaks it up breaks it up now sometimes I use a much darker color for television purposes this shows up much much better much much better there we go you know what I didn't put any grass over here this land area don't want him left out so we'll put a little bit right there make another little Peninsula give him a water line I could tap that easy easy if we got him stick her tweet here and there this has some fun shoot we're doing so well here doing so well here let's take the old fan brush load it full of brown maybe there's a happy tree maybe maybe maybe maybe yep got me right heel is right there all right there big old tree there yes we're just using the fan brush maybe he's got a friend right there right there wherever you want it it's up to you could be another little one hiding in there and we can take our liner brush paint thinner on it or into the brown and let's put an arm or two out here on the tree just a little arm hrough to there we go there's one over in here wherever you want them paint should be as thin as ink then is water there they are wherever just many or as few there we can go right into a little bit of little light color and but the indication of some highlight here one side of the trunk is usually lighter cause a light striking it and bring it all together just like that we put some grass on these little foots now round brush would go right into some of this Brown little touch of the Prussian blue just tap it right in their attempt firmly okay let's go back up there now maybe maybe there's some happy little leaves that live up here just half of all didn't as simple there and as this last shooting draws to a close I'm sort of sad to be leaving you for a while but I'll be back we already have plans the next series so we'll be back will you be back you're too good a friend to go away and leave for any length of time I'll be back let's go up here with a little bit of yellow mmm just let that rascal shine out here all kinds of beautiful little things happening and I really would like to thank you for inviting me into your home I feel as if I know you
