hello i'm bob ross i'd like to welcome you to the tenth joy of painting series if this is your first time with us i hope you grab a few paints and some brushes and come along and paint with us if you've been with us before first of all i'd like to thank you for inviting me back again so i tell you what let's have them graphically around all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and they'll come across in the same order that I have them on the palette starting with a titanium white and working all the way around while they're doing that let's go on up here and talk a second this is an 18 by 24 canvas this is a double prime spree stretched canvas and I've covered it with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white which makes it wet makes it slick it allows us to actually blend color right here on the canvas so we have that ready so let's get together and let's do a fantastic painting I'm gonna start off today with a with a small amount of phthalo blue and we just take it pull a little bit out and then tap the brush that assures a nice even distribution of color all the way through the brush just tap it - tap like so just go right up here now then let's start right up in here and we'll use little little crisscross strokes just make little X's let's put in a happy little cloud little sky okay a little more of the color mist phthalo blue isn't very pretty bright and shiny it's a happy color they're just continue to use these little crisscross strokes and allow the color to if it just literally blends with a liquid white and as you work downward here and you get all these fantastic little effects automatically sync and that easy that easy you have a quick little sky there yeah well I have this on the brush take your heart let's head the least little amount of phthalo blue they little green I mean so we have fatal blue and a little green just a small amount of the green it's very strong let's go back up here maybe we'll have a little water in here so we'll just pull right across like this very gently and pull from the outside in there so you try to pull them from from the outside and if you start here and come across it'll leave a great big mark it's very hard to blend out we want to make this as easy as possible and here we'll do is just blend that together and that a little lighter you remains right here and it sort of gives you gives the illusion of a silhouette of light it's coming across there just a little a little shiny area okay let's wash our brush now if you've painted with me before you know this is the fun part we wash our brushes with odorless thinner shake off the excess just beat the devil out of it alright now with a nice clean brush now we'll go right back up here and we'll just blend this guy out a little bit still using a little crisscross strokes now you can work this guy tell us absolutely dead or you can leave some of these little dark and light areas in it to give it some life and very gently well blended to take out the brushstrokes and right across the bottom we have a happy loose guy that easy easy okay now then let's make it let's make some big fluffy clouds today I will go right into the titanium white with a one-inch brush pick up the least little touch of the bright red very small amount it's very strong heat up your whole world okay flowed a lot of paint into the brush that's gonna appear down now maybe there's a happy little clouds that just sort of float right around this guy and have fun just sort of mix them up all here clouds are very free you notice let them play I don't play maybe it comes right off in here and goes off the top of the canvas wherever wherever this is your world so you create any kind of illusion that you want in your world there we go and these are just little floaters little happy clouds and you can put as many or as few as you want now then we'll take a clean drive be sure it's dry two inch brush and I'm gonna just gently blend it using tiny little circular strokes tiniest little strokes and just blend this together just blending just sort of mix it up then we're gonna lift it this sort of fluffs the cloud just Bluffs it right up like so see nothing very lightly there we go in that fantastic to a happy little cloud that easy okay shoot we're just going right along here tell you what I lived in Alaska oh gosh nearly 14 years or so I really like mountain so let's do a fantastic little mountain today I'm going to take some black some pression blue some Van Dyke Brown we'll put some alizarin crimson in there too be careful with the crimson or your mountain will turn purple which is alright that's sorry they wrote a beautiful song about purple mountains pull it out very flat and then cut across so you have a small roll of paint right out of the edge of the knife there you go let's go up here yeah that you have to make you have to make an almighty decision where's your Mountain eleven I think he's gonna live he is now right there right there maybe there's a bump there you just sort of make a decision and put it in mountains growing all kinds of shapes and colors and fairly restricted only by your imagination this right over like I scrape off all the excess paint here I'm just really using firm pressure pushing that paint right into the fabric yeah it would take a 2 inch brush and I want to grab it and pull this removes excess paint and blends it out so it gets lighter at the bottom you can see the entire mountain it's always lighter at the bottom than it is at the top because we have missed pollution and all those things that break up and diffuse light because this is wet though you can just move this paint you can polenta you can move it all over the canvas this was a drier canvas you'd be an agony city right now there we go let's go back to the knife and that's but let's put some snow on this mountain for that I'll take the titanium white and pull it out very flat and then cut across to get that a little roll of paint again see there okay let's go back up here now think where your lights coming from you have to start making some big decisions now if you're right-handed normally it's easier for the light to come from the right side so let's go right here touch no pressure just the weight of the knife no pressure you see there flow right down on the side of that mountain look at there just follow the angles in your mountain and let it float absolutely no pressure no pressure pretend that if you're not careful your hand will just literally float away just float away very soft and very gentle there we go see then you have to make big decisions maybe this peak right here I'll look here look here it comes see so you can bring it right in front you can move mountains you can do anything on this canvas on this canvas you have total power absolutely yeah then let's put some shadows in there for that don't take some Hawaii put a little a little pressure and blue in it just white oppression blue mix it up to us about that color pull it out very flat again cut across once again we have it small roll of paints we're very important how you load this knife I can't go back up here I want to touch and just pull down now we're following the angles on the other side of the mountain watch here I want to push that back so we'll come right here and then I'll come distinctly through see how it pushes that peak right back a sneaky huh it's easy to do you can do it really can't do it there's no big secret here we'll show you everything that you need to paint fantastic paintings there we go look at that see when you put those shadows in there everything just sort of pops out at you it brings it alive the shadows are very important so now we have a little hunk of paint right here that doesn't look like much until we add a shadow under it see there he had a shadow and it becomes a separate entity that comes a ridge all by itself come right over here just pulled in all those kinds of things and you can move these mountains anywhere it you want them watch here sometimes it's fun to just to play some games you can come right down in here man look at there look at there there's another peak it's that easy that easy when you put the shadow in here then it really becomes a personality all in its own seed you can create little ridges wherever you want them and it's just a game of angles mountains are just geometric shapes yeah we could take maybe I'll bring this one distinctly in front of that if pushes that mountain back this is one of the ways that you create depth and distance in your painting so just work with different planes okay I get carried away sometime I really like to paint mountains and I just I'd cover up the whole canvas with mountains and that's not bad when you're learning take an old canvas and start at the top and paint all the way down with mountains and they just zip them right off and do it again that's the way you learn there's a secret to anything it's practice just practice and you really can't do this I get hundreds and hundreds of letters from people all over the country just like you and I and they're painting beautiful pictures mmm some of the series we've showed some of the photographs that people have sent it's almost unbelievable they're all I'm doing is tapping and then lifting upward lifting upward like that removes the tap marks and creates that nice soft misty area down there and over here we follow these angles always follow the angles that you've created in your mountains see and that easy we got a happy mom okay let's make some little footy fields back here I will start off and mix up some color I'll just use this mountain color and let's put a little let's put some white with it and see what we have here so let's just mainly some blue and black and alizarin crimson and to that I'm going to add the least little touch least a little touch of SAP green just to give it a little greenish color now part of it here I'm going to have some white and make it even lighter just like so okay let me clean my knife yeah then let's use a different brush today this is an oval brush maybe we can get a close-up shot of yet it's it's a little different so it's sort of round this is an oval it's a little different watch here though I'm gonna fill it full that color we just made just to really load it full of paint okay let's go right up here yeah there you have to make a big decision I say the little footy Hill there's right here and all I'm doing is just having that fantastic look at all the little little things it makes in there looks like just the tops of thousands of little trees for her off in the distance look at that hmm and not a super easy way to make little footy hills now with a clean dry brush I want to create some mist at the base of this I'm gonna do it's just half the base just the base down here don't tap the top soften that give it a little tiny upward lift yeah then I'm going into the same color only a little bit darker just a little darker load the brush the same way okay let's go back up here maybe there's another little footy Hill and he lives right here about being a little darker it stands out as things get closer to you in a landscape they should get darker and darker in color look at that there may be there see how easy that is painting does not have to be difficult does not have to be difficult you don't have to be blessed by Michelangelo at Birth to be able to paint you can do in his fun there we go tap it a little bit of mist just like so give it a little up to lift and you can make a layer after layer after layer take a little more of that color same color just a little darker watch here maybe you want to come right in here let's put the indication of another one there's no limit but they need to get a little darker as they work forward I'm not careful I'm gonna cover up the whole canvas with foothills and mountains and that easy we have several layers of foothills and these different layers are Plains once again this is what causes a depth in your painting and really really makes it look good of course we're not interested in making money but you Jer be looking for that happy buck when you paint this is what sells paintings let's have some fun here we'll take some black Prussian blue SAP and green we'll throw in some alizarin crimson - what the heck good dark color should look black let me clean the knife okay now I use a fan brush to load it full of paint a lot of paint both sides just go right up here maybe there's some little evergreens that live back here in the distance here I'm just gonna take a tap and downward just a little trees they're not all evergreens maybe there's all kind of trees just tap downward tap it down now these are a little closer so you're beginning to see a little more detail there's a nice one just tap down there it makes those nice little happy tops up there and don't make them all like real even cuz then they look like fence post over there give me some character there we go this color is a little darker so it stands out now let's have some fun but has a traditional painter one thing that used to drive me crazy was reflections watch here on a wet canvas so all you do is grab it and pull it down just grab and pull down straight down where the trees are taller pull down a little further look at that instant reflections that fun that's one of the things that works the best in this method of painting his reflection is just pulling straight down and even very lightly three hairs and some air just go across and it creates the illusion of water yeah then take a little too liquid height on my knife I'm gonna get a touch of the dark sienna and add that just the least little touch there just a dull it down when you load this knife take it cut across like it say get right across pull it out flat and then cut across just go up here now they come straight into the canvas push very friendly and just cut in a happy little water line and keep this basically straight you can go anywhere you want to go but there's individual strokes should be straight otherwise your water's gonna look like it's running right out of your painting you get your floor wet and you're gonna be upset with me we want you to be happy little little ripple here in there all kinds a happy little things and that easy find it easy you got it and you can take a clean fan brush with at least a little bit of white on it and make it look like little tree trunks far away just by lifting upward just far back in the distance just just barely touch it and lift straight up there just a few don't overdo wash the old brush and let's have some fine now shoot that's handsome go mix up a bunch of dark we'll take some of the midnight black Prussian blue we'll even throw some Van Dyke Brown in there alizarin crimson SAP green just all the dark colors basically it doesn't matter make a big water paint okay let me clean the old knife off here and let's have some fun let's get a big brush and I'm gonna load this full of paint so often we avoid this big brush because of its size but the big brush can do fantastic things wiggle it wiggle it that loads the bristles full and pull it that makes it very sharp and we're loading this brush to a chisel edge it takes a lot of pain in the brush you need enough paint to hold the bristles together see how sharp it is very good that's a chisel edge let's go up here now then maybe tell you what may be a happy little evergreen lives right there we touch then just the corner of the brush begin working back and forth then we got to put some arms on his tree can give you some move little arm so I can reach up and gather it sign up look at there look at there reload your brush for each tree each tree corner you sort of make those bristles and Bend downward hmmm in that fantastic back and you can put as many or as few trees as you want many or as few maybe yeah let's have a third one there we don't want it to get lonely even trees need a friend we all have to have a friend so right there okay let's make some let's make some leaf trees to do that we pull the brush through the paint like so one direction pull it firmly through the paint and that rounds one corner there it gives it sort of a rounded look there we are now with that rounded corner toward the top let's go right up here let's put a happy treat it lives right here touch give it a little push just bend the bristles inform your tree just like so it's that easy so form your basic shapes sometime you get carried away in this game going there what the heck we just push that little lake we back in a distance what the heck when you have this kind of power you can move Lakes anywhere you want them I'll put a happy tree right here just bring all that right on together there and here all I'm doing is putting in some dark color we'll come back and go highlight all these and that quick with a big ol brush you get that all blocked it Dumanis put some OH take some dark Sienna the white pull it out flat get that small roll of paint don't like so okay let's go right up here and we just put two indication of a happy little tree trunk here in there see there that easy just sort of touch give it a little sideboard pull and maybe there's some back in here we don't have any trees live in there take the point of the knife you can put some little dead sticks and twigs over there it's that easy let's take some light going on I had at least little touch you move into that Thanks so cut across maybe there's a little tree trunk it lives right here see and you can put these everywhere you want to watch here you just take the tonight that's great then all kinds a little thing when this is all finished some of these will show and people think you spent just days and days working with these little one hairbrush putting them in don't tell many different Shh keep her secret now let's take a one inch brush and then we'll dip it right into some of the liquid white I'll go into a yellow and I'm reach up here and grab some SAP green so I've got CAD yellow SAP green and there's a little liquid right on the brush that makes the paint thinner then paint will stick to a thick paint yeah let's put some leaves on this this is what begins bringing this painting alive and worry about little forms here don't just throw them on at random see make little little forms think about this all kind of little individual limbs living in there all right we can add some yellow ochre to that and put another happy little Bush and you can put as many or as few bushes as you want but do the bush that you think is a father's two way first and then work forward that way you have layers of bushes and a little Indian yell out of it but these layers once again you get tired of hearing it but it's important these layers create the illusion of the distance at your painting here I'm using the brush sideways and just can you see that push pushing it upwards all this to it push and bin okay let's go over here in the other side now you have to start making some big decisions big decisions there's trees that live in here so you have to sort of pick them out see that there are yes here's one back here just decide where trees live in your world pedal me again Batman maybe maybe maybe we'll use I want to add a touch of the bright red here what is so this will make a nice winner don't don't go too crazy with this red little it's a fireball hmm there's a masculine have another little bush see what they've just layered one after the other Wow looks like a nice place to go fishing now then I'm gonna add a little more SAP green just bring this brush to a nice chiseled edge I'm gonna appear and put on a little bit of highlight onto the evergreens see they don't kill all your dark be careful I'm not to kill all your dark areas they're very important there we go a little bit on the street don't want him left out don't even left out I tell you what yeah if you had a beautiful place like this you'd have to way to get up here and catch a big trout to live there I know the trout lives in there let's take some Van Dyke Brown in a school right in here and maybe there's a happy little path see how easy a little path is to make there he goes and we're gonna let him go around behind that tree we don't know where it goes it just goes right on around here hides I will take some brown and some white and then very lightly barely touch there's a little blue in there too brown white touching blue it makes great see just put some highlight on there now then we want to set that path down into the painting let me get another 1 inch brush here a little bit of liquid light load it full of color now to set this path down into the painting watch here push a few little bushes that come right over it see there's another happy little Bush and we just push up path right look at there just disappeared we don't know where it's going now and we don't care Thanks and we can take the knife and very gently scraping a few little sticks and twigs and ER bet if you go right on over like that and I take liner brush a little bit of paint thinner light let's sign this what we call it finished I really hope you've enjoyed this I thank you for joining me today I look forward to seeing you again in a very near future from all of us happy painting god bless you
