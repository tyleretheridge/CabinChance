- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. You sort of caught me there. Tell you what, let's start out today and have 'em run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what you caught me doing. Today, I have my standard old pre-stretched double primed canvas. And I'm just covering the entire canvas with a very thin coat of phthalo blue. And that's all we're doing, we just take a two inch
brush and scrub it in. The canvas is dry. Just want to cover the entire canvas with this very thin coat. And I'm really, really scrubbing it in. There's not a lot of paint here. All I want to do is just stain the, just stain the canvas, that's all. That's all it takes, just scrub it in. There, I suggest you use one
of your old brushes to do this 'cause it'll sort of wear a brush out. There we are. But that's all it takes. Then right off the bat, we get to wash our brush
first thing this time. There. Okay. We just wash our brush
with odorless paint thinner as you know. Shake it off. (laughs) And just beat the devil out of it. Alright. Grab another two inch brush. I have several of them going here. Thought today, we'd just do a little scene that's very simple that
I hope you'll like. And we're gonna start
off with a little bit of the midnight black,
and just tap one corner, and you can see it good, one corner. Right there. Okay let's go up in here. Now maybe, maybe in our world, there's just a happy little
cloud that lives up here. This is pure midnight black, pure black. This is gonna be sort of like an evening or early night scene. Guess that sounds right. I want it dark. This is our world so we can create all
kind of illusions in it. There we are. Maybe big old floaty cloud that lives right up through here somewhere. Just using the corner of the
brush, little more paint. And we'll just begin applying
this however we want it. Think about little forms
and shapes in your clouds, and just let 'em happen. Clouds are interesting. You see all kinds of things in 'em. Shoot, when we were kids,
my brother Jim and I, we used to sort of lay on
our back out in the field and look up at clouds and see all kinds of crazy shapes in 'em. I bet you've done that, too,
whether you'll admit it or not. There you go. But you see all kinds of shapes in there. There. Wherever, wherever,
wherever, it doesn't matter. There we go. This is the last show of the
28th Joy of Paining series. So I'm certainly glad
you're with us today. Certainly glad you're with us. There. 'Cause this is really the
highlight of my whole life, is to make these shows and
to join you in your home, or wherever you happen to
be, and paint along with you. There. That's what I think every
artist craves and needs, is for people to accept his work. And through television,
you have done that. This has become the most popular art show in the history of television, and it's your fault. And I thank you very, very
much for your support, for all the calls and the letters
that have went to stations all over the country, literally
all over the world now. That's what keeps us on the air. So if you have time, give 'em a call. Give 'em a call, they
need your support anyway. Alright, and we can put just
a couple over here somewhere. Now then, tell you what let's do. I'm gonna get one of my
little blender brushes and just tap one little corner into the least little
bit of titanium white, tiny little bit, we can always add more. And maybe right here behind this cloud, there's a little light coming out. So we're just gonna paint
with the blender brush 'cause I want it to be
very soft, very gentle. This takes very little
paint, very little paint. And it's gonna mix with the blue, and we'll just have a light source coming from right behind that cloud. There we go. See, looks like it. Maybe the moon's back here. Maybe it's coming out of this side, too. We don't know. See, in your world, you can create any illusion that you want. Any illusion. That's what's so great about this. I like painting because
it gives me total freedom. And it's the only place in my whole life that I've had total freedom to do anything that I wanted to do, to create any illusion that I needed, to go to any world that was desirable. There, and you could do that. You can do that. There we are. But isn't that neat, the way it looks like now light's coming from
behind that little rascal? And that's all there is to it. There, firm that cloud
up just a little bit with the old two inch brush. That's basically all I'm
gonna do for this sky. When you're doing yours, you may want to put a little more detail
in it, it's up to you. Up to you. But this will certainly
show you how to do it. What you do is up to you. There, see there? We got old cloud hiding
up there, looking out. Got the moon behind him and
he's watching everything. Let's have some fun. I'm gonna take, might as well
mix up a pretty good pile, alizarin crimson and sap green. The two of them together make
a gorgeous, gorgeous brown. Sort of, I'm gonna mix it
sort of to the reddish side. That's my favorite. But you may like it
more to the green side, it's up to you, up to you. We'll just put that pile up there. Wipe the knife off. Today, let's use the
little small round brush. Go right into that nice brown
color that we just made. Just tap the brush into it. That's all, no big deal,
just tap it right into it. Okay, let's go up in here. Maybe in our world, there's this... Does now. Some little trees back here
in the background, wherever. All we're doing is putting
in some dark color, sort of like _____ Just a little bit of dark, there it comes. There. All I'm looking for is just
very basic little shapes. Like little trees that are far away. Far away back here, like so. There. We don't care. Tell you what, I've got
several of these brushes going. I'm gonna grab another one. And with that one, I'm gonna
put a little bit of yellow, bright red, I'll just mix
'em on the brush here, the yellow ochre, and tap. Just tap it to load it. A little more bright red, maybe. That's nice. I'm making an orange color 'cause orange when put against blue is striking. Let's go up here. Oh, isn't that gorgeous? I like it, I like colors like it They do nice things for you. And of course none of us are interested in selling paintings,
but if you're out there selling a painting now and then, these kind of colors sell. People love 'em, they
brighten up a dull room. There. Just sort of very back and forth between the reds and the yellows. But notice they're brighter on the top than they are on the bottom. Neat little shadow toward the bottom that makes 'em look real. There we go. Wherever, wherever, wherever. Alright, I'm going back to
the other side, right here. Forgot that little rascal,
don't want him left out. Nothing worse than a mad tree. They can really get
upset with you sometime. Don't want to upset him. There, okay. Back to my brush set. Two inch brush has brown on it. And let's put a little
bit of brown under here. Don't want to lose all that blue flavor. See, that blue is still
gonna show through. I hope you can see that. But it'll still show through, sort of. This whole painting will have
sort of a bluish cast to it because of the the phthalo
blue that we put underneath, and that's exactly what I'm looking for. It's exactly what I'm looking for. And we can just literally, I'll tell you what let's do. Let's just put a lot down here. We'll decide where we're
going with it later. Why not? We'll just keep going. We'll just keep going. But notice I'm intentionally
not covering up all that blue. I want it to show through. See these areas in here
where it's showing through? I'm looking for that. It's important to me in
this particular painting. There. See now, anybody can do this. Anybody can do this. Nice and easy. Maybe we'll bring it all
the way down, what the heck. If we want to change our mind,
we can do that later, too. It doesn't matter. Since this is our world,
we can do anything that we want to do here. Any old thing. Alright, now we've got
enough brown on here to get us started. Going back to my little small round brush, little half-round brush. Tap it a little more on
that same brown color, and yep, you know, Bobby. Gotta have a big tree in his world. There. Sometimes I get letters
from people that say, "Your painting was just perfect "until you put that silly old
big tree in it at the end." Please don't feel just because I put a tree in here that you have to. If you don't want a tree in
your world, don't put it in. That's what makes painting so great. It's a very individual thing. Alright. I want some on the other side, too. What the heck. We'll just sort of fill this in. Well we could have actually done all this with a two inch brush, it
wouldn't have mattered. Would not have mattered. There. Now then, let's have some fun. Gonna take a little touch of that same color that we used. Tap a little onto the old two inch brush. Okay, let's go up in here, and very gently, begin putting in just a little soft grassy
areas back in here. There we are. See, that's all there is to it. All there is to it. I'm gonna take a little titanium white, put a little black with
it and make a gray color, just like so. There, a little white, a little black. Make us a little gray,
we'll play with that. We'll use that as a highlight
color once in a while. We'll just touch a little of that... Oh yeah, oh, that's nice, that's nice. That's just what I was
looking for, just exactly. Exactly. I get excited sometime, sorry. There we are, that easy. I'm just gonna sort of jump back and forth between all those little colors and every once in a while
hit that gray color we made, just to highlight a little. Sometimes maybe even a little bit of the, little touch of that phthalo
blue, 'cause I want to keep this blue hint throughout this painting. There, back and forth, forth and back. There we are. Alright. A little more of the yellow ochre and red. Okay. Tell you what let's do. I'm gonna take a little yellow, a little bit of the bright red, we'll mix them together right here. I want to make a little pile of orange Oh, that's nice. Orange to the red side. Wipe the knife. Take my little round brush
and tap right in there. Just tap it, that's all there is to it. Okay, let's go back up here. Now then, I want to come back-- Nice, I want to come up in here and begin putting some little highlights right up on those, all those
little trees that we painted. There, there they come. Think about form and shape, and little arms sticking out in there. That's what makes your tree special. That's what makes it special. There we go. I like this. Like to do paintings
like this, a lot of fun. And they're easy. Even if you've never painted, these are simple little paintings. In fact, we try to design
all these paintings in this series for people
who have painted a lot as well as people who are just beginning. There. And they work for everybody, we hope. I'm gonna do that on the other side, too. Maybe less distinct over
here, just a little. Just some indications. Think I'll put some, maybe some more trees in front of this one. So I don't want this one as distinct. Just some little indications. There. Okay. Now we can sort of come up in here and clean up the bottom of that a little, just by tapping in some
little grassy areas. Something about ____ Alright. Let's take our little filbert. I'm gonna go into that
brown color I've made, take the little filbert
brush, and in my world, I think here's a tree. Yep, you're right. It lives right there. Happy little tree. And he's got a little friend there. We don't even know where he goes. Got another arm there. There's one. However many trees we want in our world. Take our liner brush, little
bit of that same brown color, and we'll just put the
indication here and there of a few limbs, something like so. I'm gonna put leaves on these. So we don't have to put
a lot of detail in 'em, don't worry about 'em. Don't worry about 'em. A few of these little limbs will show, but the majority of them we'll cover up. There we are, something like that. We got the little brush going, I'm gonna go right into a
little bit of that gray color we made with a little paint thinner. And maybe down in here with the indication of a little fence that lives back here. I don't want it to be very
distinct, it's too far away. Just like so, just a little indication, that's way back in the distance. Now, back to our little brush. We'll put few little
leaves out here on this. I decided I was gonna do that. That's the reason I wasn't worried about what was behind it so much. See. Maybe even down in here. See, you just put these wherever
you think they should be. And we'll take, I'm gonna
put a little paint thinner on the brush because we're
getting quite a buildup of paint. And I'll go right into my
orangey color that I've made. Okay, and we'll have a
few little highlights right up here on that rascal. You just put 'em wherever
you think they should be. There. I like it. I do like it. It's the colors that I like so well in this particular painting, I think. They just get prettier the more we do. Alright, something about like so. That'sabout all we need. Okay, ready to get crazy? Let's do it. Maybe right out here in our world. We check it, this is your bravery test. Maybe, yeah, what the heck. Maybe there's a big old cabin out here. Maybe it's got a big roof like that. Just sort of lay it out in your mind. Use the knife, maybe
there's a little porch that sticks out here, I don't know. Don't know that it even matters. I'm just removing excess
paint, that's all I'm doing. And I didn't make quite
enough of that brown color. Crimson and sap green,
just mixed together. Just mix up a little more
right here real quick. Alright, now then. Take a little of that brown, and we can begin blocking
in our little house. Just begin blocking it in like that. See, you're not committed yet, you can still change
your mind if you want to. That's what's so great. Over here, see, just pull
that across, straight down. There, it's a good way to see
if you like your little house. We were gonna have a little
porch sticking out there. We can do that. That easy. Right down the side. There. Over here, I noticed that
didn't make any sense, but it will in just a
second, it will, I hope. (chuckles) We'll see. We'll see. Now, I'm gonna take some white, a little bit of that brown
color, and a little black in it. And I don't want to overmix it. And let's start down here. It's too bright. I want it darker than that, so I'm gonna put a
little more black in it. It's too bright for this painting. That's a little better. Now we'll just begin putting
like some shingles on there, some old shingles on the house. Most of 'em have been
blown off over the years, but there's still a few
hanging up here still. I'm using the small edge of the knife. There we go. There they come, there they come. Something about like so. Most of them have been blown away. Take that same color. Actually it's just brown and
white, a little black in it. There we go. Pull that straight down like so. And over on this side
here, almost nothing. Almost nothing. Little post right out here to hold up our, gotta hold up our little porch. There. Little touch of highlight
that runs right along there just to make that stand out. There. Little bit of brown, and we'll turn that into old boards or
slabs, just by touching. Making little streaks. All this, we'll just cut off
and do a cabinectomy later. Let's have a big window,
big picture window. Take a little bit of the cad yellow with a little touch of yellow ochre in it. There. Now... There, fix this little window all up. Now we got a window right
there so he can see out. Now then, let's go back, take some of our, all of our colors, and let's just begin filling this in with little grassy areas
all up through here. There. Alright, maybe a little
of that gray color, just to put some little
highlights here and there, wherever, wherever. Isn't that something else? You can do little paintings like this. They're very easy and they work for you. They work for you. You have unlimited time at home, you can just piddle and
play and have more fun. If I take too much time here,
they have no sense of humor. None whatsoever. There. I'm using a little bit
of the phthalo blue, once in a while a little bit of that gray, just to sort of mix it all together. Whatever. But that blue hint will come
through in the entire painting, just because you
underpainted it with blue. There we go. Alright, all kinds of little
things living in here. The lay of the land
here is very important, the way the land flows. So pay attention to that, don't just throw these in at random. Don't just throw them in at random. Alright. Okay, we're coming right along here. We'll just take this all
the way down to the bottom. It doesn't matter, wherever
you want to go with it. Wherever. I want it to be a little darker down here so I'm going more into the browns. Alright, same thing over in here. About like that. And you can take your
time and as I was saying, you can really work at
this and smooth it all out. It's unbelievable what you can do, and I know you can do it. I know you can do it. There we go. As I mentioned, this is the last show of the 28th Joy of Painting series. And I want to thank you
very much for being with us. It really is your support
that keeps us on the air. And you're special, very, very special. Without you we wouldn't be here. So before we have to leave, I'm want to, on behalf of my partners
Walt and Annette Kowalski, and all the fantastic
people here at the station, we'd like to thank you for your support and for making us feel special. I'm gonna take a little
of that paint thinner, a little yellow ochre here and there. Maybe there's some bushes
that live down here. We'll throw in a few little weeds. We'll use a little yellow ochre, sometimes a little bit of cad yellow, a little red just mixed together, just to give the impression-- Oh, there's a nice one,
some nice little bushes that live right here. There, something about like that. Shoot, I think we about
have a finished painting. Let's sign this rascal. Take a little paint thinner
and a little bit of red and we'll sign it. Really hope you've enjoyed this painting and this entire series. It's always our pleasure to be with you. And from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting. Until next time, God bless, my friend. (elevator music)
