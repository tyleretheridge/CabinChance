- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today we'd
just do a little painting that's a lot of fun, and
I think you'll enjoy it. So let's start out and have
them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I got up here today. Today I have my standard old,
I'm using an 18 by 24 inch double-primed, pre-stretched canvas, but you use whatever size you'd like. And I've taken some contact paper and just cut a little oval out. And then we've covered the whole inside with a little liquid white,
and that's all there is to it. So without further ado,
let's just have some fun. I'm gonna start with a
little two-inch brush. We'll go into small amount, just a very small amount
of the Indian yellow. Don't need much, just a little. Let's go right up in here. Then we'll come right up in here. Let's do a scene today that
has a lot of earth tones in it, something that's very earthy. There we are. Start with a little Indian yellow. We'll just throw a little in like that. Without cleaning the brush, I'll just add a little
touch of yellow ochre. Just a little bit of yellow ochre, and we'll let those blend together. Ochre is sort of a nice, gold color. It's beautiful. I like it. Now, then. We're going to use nice earth tones today. Tell you what, tell you what. Gonna grab my little knife here. Let's mix, today, some alizarin crimson and sap green, in about equal parts. These two colors mixed
together make a beautiful, beautiful brown. Very warm, chocolate brown. I like it. And you could use your dark
sienna and Van Dyke brown, but I thought today we'd
use this warm brown. Very nice. Okay? Let me wipe off the old knife here. And we mix these colors pretty good. Sometimes we leave colors marbled, but these, I mixed them pretty good. And we'll load up some color
with the old two-inch brush. I didn't even clean it. Just right on top. Let's go back up in here. We'll start right at the tippy-top, and using little X's,
little criss-cross strokes, we're gonna begin blending downward. The color is continually
mixing with the liquid white that's on the canvas, and it'll get lighter and
lighter as you work down. There. Somewhere about like that. We'll come back and blend all
that out in just a second. Right now we're just applying some color. All right, now while I
have that color going, maybe in our world shoot your hornet. We'll just do something like that. We can do anything we want in our world, and I think maybe we'll just
put a little color down here. We'll see what happens. There. Something about, like that. All right. The most fun part of this whole procedure. (laughs) If you've painted with me before you know that's washing the brush. We wash our brush with
odorless paint thinner. There's a screen in the
bottom of the bucket that I'm scrubbing the brush against. There we go. Now then, we just shake off the excess. (brush banging) (laughs) And beat the devil out of it. That really is the fun part. And then I'm gonna start in the light area with a clean brush, and just blend upward, about like that. You wanna blend this until you can't tell where one color stops and the next color starts. And then it's just right. Just right. There. That's about all I'm gonna do for a little sky in this painting. Okay. Now then. Let's use that same brown color we made out of the crimson and sap green. Once again, in about equal parts. I'll make a light brown here. So I put some white and
some of that brown together. Now then. Cut across, and get a little roll of paint lives right on the end of the knife. Let's go up in here. And maybe we'll put the indication. I don't want a lot of detail. Just an indication of a little mountain that lives way back in the distance here, far away. Little quiet guy. There he comes. And all we're looking for
is the top shape up here. We could care less what's happening below. We just want the top. The rest of it will just happen. There. Hmm. Now then. Take the ol' two-inch brush, go right up in there, and bend it firmly. Pull it, and you can move this paint. The canvas has liquid white on it. It's wet, slick, and you can
literally move the color... and allow the base of it to
just blend right out to nothing. See? Already it looks like a
little mountain that's living, gosh, we don't even know
how far away it's living. Way back in the distance somewhere. Quiet little guy. All right. Now, as you know, in a landscape, as things get closer to you, they should get darker in value. So we use that same color, and I'm just adding a little
more of the brown to it. Maybe we'll have another range here of little distant mountains. About like so. Once again, cut off. Get our little roll of paint. That little roll of
paint is very important. It makes applying it up
here much, much easier. Another big decision. Where does our little mountain live? Or this is quite a big mountain. Maybe he lives right there. Something like that. These are decisions that you have to make. In your world, you have unlimited power. Absolutely unlimited power. You can change the
course of mighty rivers. You can build mountains. Anything that you wanna do in this world, you can absolutely do. There. Now then, wipe the knife off. And I'll just, I'll wipe the
knife on just a paper towel. There now. Once again, I'm gonna grab this and pull. Think about angles here. Because of today, I'm only
gonna use brush strokes to create all the highlights and shadows in these little mountains. There we are. Before this series is over, we'll do some mountains
where we go in and paint. Make a lot of detail. But these I want to be far away. And things that are far away,
you don't see a lot of detail. In fact, if you put too much detail, you lose that illusion of distance. But just the brushstrokes will create enough illusion that it's sufficient for what we're doing. See there? It looks like mountains back here. And it's all we need. Hmm. Easy. Can do, easy. All right. I like that brown. I'm gonna keep using it here. But we'll take and make it darker. A little bit darker. There. Something about like that. Each layer, once again, as it gets closer to you,
should get darker in value. Darker and darker. We just grab a, I'm using a number six fan brush, but you can use number three. Doesn't matter, doesn't matter. You make the decision. Load both sides of the
bristles with a lot of paint, a lot of paint. Let's go up here. Now, let's have some little,
some little distant trees. Show you how easy they are to make. If you've painted with me before, you've probably done this. You know it works wonderfully. Wonderfully. We get letters everyday from fantastic people,
all over the country, who'd never believe that they could create such beautiful masterpieces. Get hundreds and hundreds
of photographs from people. I can't even believe what they're doing. It's wonderful. And my young friends,
all over the country, are doing this. And they're painting paintings. I have young friends that
are 12, 13, 14 years old, that are actually selling paintings and making a happy buck. Isn't that fantastic? What better thing to give
young people confidence than do something like this, and people come along and are willing to pay
'em for their efforts. It's not the money. The money means nothing. But what it does to a young person, or even an old person like me. It's ego. Is unreal that somebody would
spend their hard-earned cash on something that you saw in your mind and you put on a piece
of canvas with your hand. I'm gonna create some mist
down here at the bottom. Two-inch brush, I'm using only the top corner. When I tap it, strongly, severely. Just really get in there and take out all your
frustrations and hostilities. Now gently, gently. Enough hostility. Now gently lift upward, see? Takes out the tap marks and
creates the illusion of mist, floating right down at the base. I'm gonna wash my little fan brush off. I just wanna, I wanna play a little more. Little more. And I'm gonna go into straight brown. That brown we made with the
crimson and the sap green. Just straight. I want this to be the darkest
layer of background trees. There we go. Now, right under here. Let's have another layer. And in your world, you make
as many layers as you want. But each one of these little layers will help increase the
illusion of distance in your painting, and to me, that's very desirable. I like paintings that
have great depth in them. That's what some of the old
masters were so good at. You could look into their paintings and absolutely see into infinity. There we go. Now then. I wanna create the
illusion of a reflection. Now, when I was a traditional
painter, this was hard to do. But watch here. All you do is grab it. (laughs) Look it there. Grab it, pull down. Straight down though. And then gently go across. Just enough to sorta give
it a little watery feel. And I'll lift up just a wee bit. Little bit, little bit. There. Like that. Now, I'm gonna go into Van Dyke brown. I'll even put a little dark sienna in. I want a very dark brown now. Once again, cut off that
little roll of paint. And let's just put that
little indication back here. Maybe it is a little land
mass that lives under there. Holds the trees up so they
don't fall in the water. Something about like that. I'm gonna lift upward here
and there on it just there, to break up that top edge. Now, let's take a little
touch of the liquid white. I'm gonna put a little brown in it too. Just a little bit. Pull it out very flat, and cut across. Let me do it again so
you can see it for sure. Cut across. And we go up here. Take that. And we can literally, we'll just cut us in a
happy little water line, lives right in here. Right in here, like that. There. All right. And you could put a little ripple or two in the water if you want. It's up to you. Up to you. There. But all these lines need to
go basically straight across. If they don't, it'll look
like the water's gonna run right out of your painting. And you don't want that. All right. Ready to get brave with me? (laughs) You know me. If you've painted with me before, you know I have a love of big trees. I'm gonna take some Van
Dyke brown, dark sienna, and I'm just pushing the brush like so. Let's go up in here. Big tree time. All right. Why not right over in here? Just use the corner of the two-inch brush. Just the corner. And let's begin putting in
some basic shape and form. of old giant tree that lives right here and overlooks this beautiful little scene. About like that. I don't wanna lose the
top of my little mountain. I wanna be able to see it, sort of through the branches. So we'll sort of work diagonally to that. There we are. All right. But now, when you're doing your tree... you sort of, you decide, you decide, what shape you want it to be. Big tree, maybe smaller than this one. Or it could be bigger. In your world, maybe the
tree's stronger than this one. There. It's up to you. Absolutely and completely up to you. Painting offers you freedom. Okay, now I'm gonna reload the brush. But this time, I'm gonna
load it a little different. I'm gonna pull it. Just go straight down, and
pull it in one direction, right through the same colors. Van Dyke. I'm gonna reach over here
and get a little black too. Darken it. I want this to be dark, dark. So you have black, dark
sienna, Van Dyke brown. I'm just mixing them on the brush. But notice, the brush is straight down, and I'm pulling it in one direction. That'll create a curve. And I'm gonna turn the brush over. See that curve, right at the top? You want it up. Okay, let's go up in here. With that rounded part
of the brush to the top. Watch here. You can touch and push, and we'll start making
all kinds of little bushes that live back here in our world. Just push. Try not to let the brush slide. It's just a push and a bend, and then you come straight out. Maybe, yep. Right along in here. I don't know. You decide in your world where you want all these things to be. Wherever. Once again, on this piece of canvas, you have unlimited power. So you make these big decisions. You decide. To me, that's probably
one of the most fun parts of painting. There. All right. Now. Let's take, hmm, there's a fan brush. It's already dirty. I'll put some brown on it. Grab my knife. We'll have a little bit of fun here. I mixed a little bit of the liquid white with some titanium white. I wanna thin it down a little bit. Grab a little touch of dark sienna. I wanna make a light brown. But this color is a little bit thinner than what it was originally, 'cause I put a little
liquid white with it, intentionally, to thin it down. Okay, wipe off the knife. Now, I'm gonna dip the
brush into a small amount, a small amount of paint thinner, and go right through Van Dyke brown. Once again, we've thinned
the color a little. Now, take this. See the light color that we made? Pull one side through. So now I have light on this side, dark on that. Light, dark. 'Kay? Now, you have to make a decision. Which side is the light coming from? I think we'll have it come from the left. Touch, and pull down. And in one stroke, you can make the highlight and the shadow of a nice tree trunk. That easy. Isn't that sneaky? Maybe we'll have another one,
to show you how to do it. Straight down. (woosh) There. And that easy. We have just a little tree trunk. 'Kay, I'm gonna use the
ol' dirty brush here. Has the brown on it. I'm gonna go into some of my yellows, yellow ochre, predominantly. Maybe, let's get crazy. Take a little bright
red and put it in here. (gasp) Nice color. But notice how we're loading this. Put it on both sides, and
then give it a little push. That little push. See that little ridge right there? There's one just like it on the brush, and that's what we're gonna paint with. 'Kay. Let's go up in here. Now, we go slightly above the dark, 'cause we want the shadows underneath. And using just the corner of the brush. That didn't show well enough. I'm gonna add a little
touch of liquid white. I want that brighter, so you can see it. Gonna reload the brush, same way. That's a little better. A little better. Just want you to be able to see it. Normally, when we're
painting for television, we paint a little brighter
than we would at home, so it shows up better. There. But now we get thinking
about shape and form... and put in all kinds of
little leaves and stuff that live here on your tree. These are the highlights. This is the fun part. Icing on the cake,
whatever you wanna call it. There we go. There. But you need a dark background
to make these show up. Light against light creates nothing. Dark against dark creates nothing. They just blend together. So you need contrast. Light against dark, dark against light. Play with it. You'll enjoy it. It's what makes a painting interesting. There we are. Ooo, a little red there. Looks like Jack Frost hit here a little. I like that. Darker, darker, darker
down here toward the base, because at the base of the tree, there will be a nice shadow area. That's where all my little friends, little Peapod, the pocket squirrel, and my little bunny rabbits,
and all those live in there. There. Okay. Let me find a little one-inch brush. There. And let's take, we'll go through a little cad yellow, we'll just use all the yellows. Be right back. I'm gonna get a little alizarin crimson. If we're gonna have colors
that sort of remind us of fall. Once again, pulling that
brush in one direction. It's a beautiful close-up here. You can see it. Now, turn it over. See that curve? That's what we want toward the top. Let's go up here. Now, right above. We can go right in here. And we can begin putting some
gorgeous little highlights on these individual bushes. Work on one bush at a time. One bush at a time. Don't get greedy. I know, I know, it gets good, (laughs) and you get greedy. Maybe even though we talking about autumn, maybe a little sap green. 'Cause all bushes don't
turn at the same time. Maybe this one back here, maybe there's a little
green left in there. Maybe when Jack Frost
was coloring all these, maybe he missed this one. Something like that. There. There. Just let your imagination
take you to any world that you want to be in. Any world. It's what's so great about imagination. To me, it's the greatest
thing that an artist owns, is his imagination. Because without imagination, it's hard to envision
things and to paint 'em. Let your imagination go. It's like any other part of your body. The more you use it,
the better it becomes. Just like exercising a muscle in your arm, your imagination gets better too. There. Now if you have trouble
making your paint stick, add the least little touch of
paint thinner or liquid white. Now, liquid white will make
your color a little brighter, and it'll change it a little. Sometimes, sometimes
that's very desirable. Sometimes you wanna keep the
color pretty close to being... what you loaded on the brush. Pure. And in those cases... you would use a little paint thinner. But, let me reemphasize the word "little." You don't need much. You need very, very little. Okay. Shoot, we're coming
along here pretty good. We need a path in there. Just seems like a natural place. Take a little of that Van Dyke brown. Once again, get our little roll of paint. That little roll is very important. Let's go up in here. Now then, just sort of go back and forth, gently, gently touching the canvas. There. And if you mess up a little
bush like I did there, we'll just go back, and
we'll drop it right back in. In our world, we can change
anything, whenever we want. Whenever we want. Now I'm gonna take a little
brown, a little white, mix it together. And we'll make just a
little highlight color to put on there. Maybe I'll even put a little
touch of the crimson in there. (gasps) Just to warm it up. There. Once again, cut it off, and that little roll of paint. I'm gonna keep saying that over and over, 'cause it's so important. I was talking about my little squirrel, Peapod, that lives up here. Believe it or not, he's still with me. I let him go, oh, more than a year ago. And he still lives in my backyard, and he comes every single day... and scratches on the back door, just like a little puppy. And he'll scratch on the door, and if he sees me in the kitchen, until I pay attention to him. And I'll open the door. He'll come in the house. He knows where I store all the goodies, and the nuts and everything. And he'll go pick him out
a nut, and out he goes. But even after a year, he remembers, and he comes back. And to me, that's very special, that one of God's little
creatures would take the time to share their little world with me. That's special to me. I don't know, but I'm 'bout half-crazy, so. There we are. Okay, let's take a clean knife. I just wanna put the
indication, here and there, of some little sticks and bushes, in the bushes. There. Just some little things
that live back here. 'Cause they're always here. You always see 'em in the woods. Yeah, there. Okay, maybe over on this side. The other little squirrel
that I still keep, she has epilepsy. And I've maintained her
now for four or five years, 'cause, you know, the veterinarian told me she would die in six months. But I didn't tell her, and she's been with me all these years. And that's Squirrely Girly Brown. You've seen her, I think, if you watch the show. I've shown her many times in the past. She's a neat little squirrel. She still lives with me. And I keep her in my
basement in a great big cage. The basement's where I paint. So she's right next to
where I practice painting. I tell you what, let's
bring the camera up here. I'm gonna take the contact paper off. It's time for the moment of truth here. And let's take a look-see at what we have. Pull that paper off. There. There's your painting. That easy. And this is your last chance. Now you have to come back and do any kind of little
things that you wanna do. And your painting is just about finished. I'm gonna take a little
bit of paint thinner, a little bit of brown. Maybe we'll put a little stick out here. Got a little time left. So maybe in our world there lives, maybe there's a little ol' tree
that pooped out right there. Maybe he died. But his little skeleton's still here. And in nature... you see little trees like this all over. There. See, but mix paint thinner with
your paint, to make it thin, almost to the consistency of ink. And then it'll flow
right over the top of it. That's all there is to it. And you decide where they live. Okay? I think with that, we're gonna call this one done. I'm gonna take a little
bit of the bright red, a little paint thinner, and
we'll sign this little rascal. Hope you've enjoyed it. We'll sign it right here. This is a very simple little painting. Don't think you'll have
any trouble with it. But if you paint it, if you have time, take a photograph of it and send it to us. We would love to see it, and every once in a while, we put 'em together, and we like to show 'em on TV. Until then, I'd like to
wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (uplifting music)
