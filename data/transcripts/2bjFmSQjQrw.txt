hi I'm glad to see you ready to do another fantastic little painting super tell you what let me tell you what I've got going up here already today I have my standard old canvas up here but I've taken black gesso and I've painted sort around the edges here just to give me sort of sort of a weird little shape and all of that I've covered then with a mixture of phthalo blue SAP green and Van Dyck Brown just all the way around here and in the center there's nothing here just blank canvas I've just covered that with a little bit of liquid white so I tell you what let's haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and we'll go on up here and get started as I say this this mixture here is they low blue SAP green and in brown I put the brown and there just to dull it just to dull it all we're looking for here is just a nice thin even coat of color almost of the dark area now because this is so dark and the paint is transparent it still looks black here but there is color on here and when we begin putting different things on here you'll see what happens these are fantastic I love these black canvases just absolutely love them tell you how let me grab another brush here let's put some let's put some more from this guy I'll take a clean brush won't get the least little touch of alizarin crimson on it just a tiny little bit and maybe here and there in the sky it's a little bit of crimson maybe a little that'll show through and just make some little warm places don't want it too bright just a little hair in there a little touch more I will even have some down here very little of this will show and anything that we don't like we just covered up because we don't make mistakes we have half the accidents there we I you could even take it in touch of the yellow ocher least little amount though tiny little bit and you could put a little that here and there just put some brightness in the sky wherever least little touch though probably at this point it really doesn't show up much but it will once we begin putting some darks in here okay now back to our color that we've covered this with I want to begin bringing this right down into the liquid white now we begin making decisions maybe this is a big tree that lives right here and his limbs his arms hang right over like so see just use a corner of the brush and bring some of that color right down to the liquid white it'll get lighter and lighter and value mitts super is just using the corner of the brush okay since the corner of the brush there and you can just pick up more colors you need it right off here maybe right in here lives a tree I don't know just sort of look around make a decision and drop it in maybe there's a nice tree that see there it goes right up through there there is you can make him as big or as small as you want him in your world there he goes he's just a happy little tree that lives here there we go maybe over here there's just all kinds of little bushes and stuff there we back in the background it's hard to even make out a lot of detail this is one of those paintings have give you the indication to feel that you're deep deep in the woods I like those because I like to get out in the woods and sort of just wander through and I'm a big-time hunter I carry a camera with me and I shoot him son of a guns with a camera I wouldn't hurt him I'm I'm not much a shooting Bambi I'd really take a picture of me there we go let's see already you're beginning to get the impression of all kinds of things happening now then over here on this side let's just let some of these big lambs just sort of hang over it always amazes me that you can do all this detail using a great big brush like this I spend so many so many years of my life has a traditional painter working with little tiny brushes and used to fret over tank that's a good word used to fret over paintings would I'd worry with them and work with them let's take some paint thinner and I'm gonna take a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown mix it with paint thinner want it very thin just turn that liner brush in there get it full of paint now then here and there we need us a little tree trunk so let's start right in there making a wiggle D tree there he is putting an arm or two here and there say there just no wiggle D tree back in here just the indication of a few little things that are happening don't want these to be real bright and strong very subdued a lot of little things happening back here we don't know what they're there they just sort of just sort of visualize this in your mind and drop it in there wherever you think you should be that's exactly where they should be there we go some Rihanna up in here too big old tall skinny trees up in here trees are like people they come in all sizes and all shapes different personalities that's what makes them all beautiful just like people there well already we've got a forest to go in there today let's just use the little one-inch brush just use a little one-inch brush and pick up a little bit of green a little yellow reach over here get some yellow ochre whatever little bright red little touch of the Indian yellow I want to mix a lot of different colors on this brush a lot of different colors so there's there's not just one oded colors a lot of things happening here there's life it's interesting it's fun look at here now we just use a corner of the brush and cover right in here I don't want much color back here this is too far away too far away I don't want to lose the illusion of depth and distance here this is the bin the woods and far back these things over on each side are gonna be closer to us those will make brighter they'll stand out strong but these they're far away quiet little happy things back here there we are little squirrel sets right there he watches everything it's going on maybe just indication here and there see just like that think about the shape you want new trees don't just hit it rammed up don't get it random I know you get tired of hearing me say that but I want you to be happy with what you've accomplished if the trees just look like they've been hit at random you're not going to be happy with them there we are and it's important to me that you're satisfied with what you do see look at that little tree boy he just that nice tree he just sets right out there and here and there you can just put individual little bushes we don't know where they're at pick up a little more the Indian yellow a little a little bit of the red maybe right over in here there's a nice little Bush right little Sun okay think of one Bush at a time one the bush at a time I know sometimes when you watch it looks like you take a running start and just suck in bunch of them at once but one bush at a time are you great great dividends in if paintings will be much nicer think of each one is an individual there and work in layer C complete the most distant layer and keep coming forward forward forward there and yeah and then let's have some fun today we'll take a 2 inch brush I'm gonna go right into a small amount of titanium white just a little bit just a little bit maybe there's some water into here got to make your first major decision just touch and pull straight down straight down see there's color on the canvas and when you put the white it comes alive look at that and you can make this as bright as you want it the more white you add the brighter it will become if you want to be subdued then use it very very little this is strictly an individual preference look at it make it the way you want it comes right across but see these little bright marks here you can push up you can push it make them wiggle like all kinds of beautiful beautiful effects I sneaky admit let's take some Van Dyck Brown this plain old Van Dyck Brown put without very flat cut across and there's our little roll of paint that we always use maybe back in here there's some land that lives here gotta have something for all these little bushes and trees and everything to set on don't them to fall off in the water make a big splash there they are okay gonna use a little bit of white put the least a little bit of it they love blue into at least little touch of blue this is just titanium white with a little blue cut across and once again we got the smallest in the role of paint can hardly see it tiny to the role of paint and all I'm going to do just touch the canvas the canvas will pull off what it wants just touch you don't have to do anything but just touch it's a tiny little water line underneath there the brown and white we can come back in here put the indication hearing over a little highlight on some of those little rocks and stones that are back in there we got it made now pick up a one-inch brush again maybe over here something else is happening tell you what let me show you a trick we go back this big dirty brush this is the same color that we used to fill all this in watch you watch here sure you have a like this tap in a little dark we need that dark sorrel idle chill but look how that pushes that back already already now we go into her a little one-inch brush tap in some color tap in some color okay now then watch here see here's a happy little Bush it lives right there right there and he's got a friend maybe this is his girlfriend here there we are see they're that easy though just put them rascals where ever you want them and all we're doing is just tapping with a corner of the one inch brush there we go and we can just go wherever wherever pick up a little more SAP green here maybe back in here old dark bush he's hiding back in here in the shadows there he lives right there now then let's have some let's have some land here let's see how that pushes that son of a gun back maybe there's some big stones that live right here just put in your dark this is straight Van Dyke Brown maybe there's a big ol stone a huge stone I just sort of see these things in your mind drop them in turn up a min big little stone there okay now to bring this out and make it part of the painting we need a little reflection under it so I'll take a little more of the white and watch right here touch right underneath there and pull straight down it's important on these reflections that you go straight down there see there straight down and we let them get darker darker darker as I get back over here in my mind the lights coming through there so over here it's gonna be much darker they're very gently go across and not easy we have instant water we use a small knife take some dark sienna use a touch of Prussian blue in it I want it to be darker darks and a little pression blue and white maybe a little more of the sienna oh that's what I'm looking for it but leave it all marble II like it cut off our little roll of paint and let's go up here and let's just sort of bounce in a little a little highlight on these rocks and stones give them some shape and some form but not over mixing the color that comes out exactly the same way on your knife so you get all these little happenings here all those little colors just sort of happen maybe over here is one it wherever in your world to sort of look around and see where you want a stone in a rock and all those nice things and drop them in there okay now then we can take our white I think we use a little they little blue in it pull that out very flat tiniest little roll of paint they come back in here and we just put the indication of a little water line into here barely barely touching the canvas we'll pull off what it wants and give you back what's left okay now we can get in here and really get crazy don't take a little bit of this is just the brown in the white little paint thinner liner brush maybe in here we can just make up indication here and there up a little tree trunk I'm not looking for a lot of detail in here most of this is going to be covered up but maybe here and there we can see a little bit of that just a little maybe a little touch over in here somewhere wherever you want there as I say 99% of this is going to disappear but you might see a couple of them and it'll look like we really worked a long time to put them in there and that's our secret we don't tell anybody okay let's go back into our yellows little green you have ochre all those beautiful colors now let's start working on these big trees I just let them son of a guns just shine out here in the sunlight still just using the corner of the brush nothing else just the corner of the brush and begin putting in all kinds of little little happy things here there there so once again think about shape and form and all the little things that are going on inside of here there we are that's fantastic and you can do it you really can do it there see but by covering this with the black gesso you've done half your painting already before you start shoot you can also use the liquid black and get the same basic effect either one works well like gesso might be a little easier to handle because it's dry there okay maybe make up a dark dark green maybe down in here there's a few dark bushes hid down here well that's really horrible girl ooh be a creature in there alright kidness cool the other side it's going out to sign here little yellow ocher little bright red that's just there there comes another tree but when you're doing these just just sort of let your imagination go just let your imagination go think about all the happy little trees and I think I mentioned maybe in one of the other shows I got a letter from somebody here a while back in this but everything in your world seems to be happy that's for sure that's why I paint it's because I can create the kind of world that I want and I can make this world as happy as I want it shoot if you want bad stuff watch the news there we go this is a tranquil place here we don't allow any bad stuff in our paintings don't allow it there we are just layer after layer though so I never got I may find no big brush I won't place more games here we'll take somewhere that dark colors the same color I put on the canvas when we started it's a mixture of samba green that's labeled blue and brown and we'll come right down through here like so we'll put a little Peninsula over here little Peninsula right there take some of our colors same old colors we're gonna use the same colors over and over tap little in the brush come right out here look at that look at that even after thousands of paintings I still get excited over this still get excited just layer after layer though layer after layer why there would be a mosquito in there too there is no doubt in my mind I was born in Florida used to see places like this when I was a kid and you can bet there was there was a happy mosquito living in there let's put some reflections under there straight down straight down come across that easy we got a reflection I think this is a good day to get crazy I'm gonna take the knife loaded full of Van Dyck Brown have a big roll of paint on it and maybe in my world their lives you know me I think their lives a big tree right here big tree big tree and he's got an arm lives right out over here now you could put this on with a fan brush or whatever I just thought today we'd use a knife there we go hmm when I say big tree I meant a big tree and he continues to grow look at their nice old tree maybe all I have that Brown going we just put some stones and some rocks dirt all those good things down here for the tree to settle you need some big things boy headon that one falls over in the water he's gonna make one devil of a splash would take some white some bright red we all Sparkle that son of a gun take some dark sienna and mix it so it's marble d see it's all different colors in there we cut off a little roll of paint and let's come right down this tree right down this tree scuse my arm you just let it graze and slide see there you're just barely barely touching though barely touching let the knife just just barely touch if you've made mountains with me and some of the other paintings then you know how to do this already that's why mountains are so great for teaching in it they teach you how to use the knife I'll take a little touch of pure white these little touch and go right down this edge I want that edge to jump out edge is it does a little bit of the pression blue and white will come right down the other side just here and there put the indication of a little reflected light see right in there right in there now going back to my paint thinner a little bit of a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown we just put a limb here and there this left maybe this old trees did maybe maybe he's dead so here and there they're still an old Elm is trying to hang on trying to hang on there we go but most of them most of them have already fell off so we have one or two there okay back to my one-inch brush we'll go right into a little bit more of the color just a tiny bit of color tiny bit of color and I'm going to come right into here put a few little things underneath this foot that sort of sets him right down and all those nice grassy thanks a little bit of brown and white and just let it jiggle down through there there there we are see there's a happy little stone lives there looky wherever you wanting with everyone a little bit of a pale blue and white create us a little water line right right in there look at that see just let the knife bounce and play right through there wherever you want it okay maybe shoot let's keep going here let's keep going let me clean off a spot what take some more Brown maybe over here in this corner lives a big old stone great big ol rock he sets out here in the water has a good time maybe's little bee bird lives out here and he comes assess on this rock watches what all is happening okay and maybe there's a point out here on this rocks off just take a little bit of the white pull down make the indication of a tiny little reflection there's right there now that'll show up in just a second bear with me take a little of the highlight color see here now see there we can just begin putting some highlights on these stones there's a shape petal Rocco slate bounce around there little touch of color over in here like so there we are well has a mean-looking or rockets that's out there in the water watches everything happen little touch of the blue and the white there we go just sort of let these colors work together make it rock strong and maybe maybe there's a seed or two that has dropped out here and a little bit of grasses growing out here on the stone it's a nice place for a little weed baracy he lives out there on the edge of this top that way the beaver sets up here his foots don't get against the hard stone he's got a nice soft spot to put his foots there we are and there we are there we are and we can take our blue and white come right back up in here put a little indication of a water line right under there like so clean not this one go here there scratch the indication of a little stick little twig whatever you want to maybe a few over here just like so I think we bet heavy finish painting I take the liner brush go right into the red let's come right in here sign this one hope you've enjoyed it this is one of the most fantastic little scenes and it'll work for you give it a shot and take a picture of it in semi let me see how you do from all of us here happy
