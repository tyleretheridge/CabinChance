hi hey welcome back I'm certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting tell you what let's start off and hammer on all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and they'll come across in the same orders I have them on the palette while they're doing that let's go on up here I've got my regular ol 18 by 24 canvas and I've already covered it with it nice then even co2 the liquid white so it's all ready to go so let's get started let's start with the old two-inch brush today I like a big brush I'm gonna go right into a little touch of the Prussian blue a little Prussian blue then where we tread up here and grab a touch of the black so I get Prussian blue and black and just tap them tap the bristles right into the paint like so casco pair now then let's make it let's make some happy little clouds today so we'll start off just use little X's little X's like so and lay in some lay in some sky area just a little crisscross strokes we don't want to cover the whole canvas today I want to leave some I'm gonna leave some holes in this guy sometimes it's a little easier to to put a cloud in if you just leave an area open just let it blend right on down and this continually continually mixing with the liquid white that's on the canvas like it's lighter and lighter and lighter as it works down so that the canvas work for you maybe right in here whatever whatever you want just let that blend right on down like so they're safe that easy thank you see you have a happy little sky there we go very lightly we'll just blend that to take out the brushstrokes and while I have that going same old dirty brush shovel I won't have a little touch of phthalo blue this time just a small amount very small amount a little bit of black so I have phthalo blue black and then a touch of phthalo green just a touch it's very strong very strong okay let's go right up here well have some water in his painting today so let's go ahead and just lay in some little water indications start to the outside pull inward outside and pulling right like so okay then over here we're going this direction and I'm not sure exactly how much water we're going to have so we'll just do the whole thing and we'll leave water where we want the rest of it we'll just paint over you can do anything here so don't worry about it all we're doing is laying color on the canvas at this point there pain and very lightly very lightly we're just blend right across okay let's wash your brush if we wash our brush with odorless thinner shake off the excess then let's beat the devil out of it okay let's build a happy little cloud we just use that same old brush go right through the titanium white I'm gonna reach down here and grab least least little touch of the bright red least little touch doesn't take much pull it pull it firmly through there get a lot of paint on it okay let's go up here now then if we're gonna have a little cloud maybe one lives right here just use a corner of the brush and make little circular strokes see let's let that little cloud just just come right off and brush they live right here in the bristles all you have to do is sort of shake them out maybe right here there's another little cloud that just floats around see they're just as many or as few as you want maybe there's another one there wherever wherever okay maybe over in here there's another one and in your painting you sort of look at it and decide how many clouds you want in your world but more or less or whatever whatever makes you happy painting should set you free should make you very happy should be relaxing a lot of fun should be your good friend okay make care of a clean brush here and I have several brushes coincide spend all my time wash them I get to make a kick out of Washington brushes okay now I'm gonna just blend the base of these at all I don't want to blend the outside edges as yet just sort of blend the basin and don't overwork them don't overwork I'm just just a little bit leave them alone and if you have a little paint on your brush you can just beat it and that'll take off the excess paint without going through the entire cleaning procedure there beat the little devil here lift it lift it big circular strokes don't want to go straight up if you do it look like it's raining up and it'll so her body it's raining up there alright okay they're now very lightly just over the entire sky very lightly look at that do you ever believe you could make such fantastic clouds that easy you can you really can yeah yeah okay all right now wash this brush a little give it a little shake and just beat the devil out of him too let's build us a little mountain today let's have some fun and we'll take some black Oh with a little oppression blue in it and some crimson and maybe the least little touch of yellow ochre so black blue little crimson little yellow ochre now if you want to check and see what color you got you have to sort of put a little white out here and test it because that just looks black to you and that looks all right the yellow ochre gives it just a little green issue will cut off a little roll of paint let's go right up here maybe today we have a mountain that lives right here and it comes around and down now I'm pushing very fun very firm maybe there's a little bump wherever you want a little bump and just frightened out see really really push that paint right into the fabric though just really you can give it a good strong good strong push don't be afraid you're gonna hurt the canvas get in there really put it in hmm alright alright scrape off all the excess scrape and scrape it quite firmly alright now we can take a large brush be sure it's good and dry and let's blend that grab it and pull it just grab it give it a full and you can begin sort of laying out the highlights and shadows of your mountain these brush strokes will show and you're not committed you can see how those brush strokes so they give you an idea of how you want to lay it out and you can change your mind you can you can change the whole mountain and you can do this over and over and over till you get it the way you want over here maybe comes down soon goes right on out so they're all ready you can begin picking out shapes here and you haven't really done anything and we want to blend this with disorder comes right down to nothing down at the base very soft there we go okay yeah thought today would do something a little bit different someone I'll take a little bit of titanium white on the knife and up in here I just want to put the indication of a little bit of a little bit of color this is titanium white least little touch of the bright red in it so it's got a slight pinkish shoe but not much maybe right in here no pressure just a little touch here and there hmm Allen he's gonna take the single brush and I'll go right into a little yellow ocher reach up here getting SAP green I'm just gonna tap this right into it so it's sort of a greenish color it's yellow ochre SAP green a little black in it pack up a little that CAD yellow tap to load it though just tap firmly okay let's go ahead up here and maybe this is a soft grassy little Mountain got little little grasses that grow right up the side of it there see here they come and they come there and that's super and just see the shun sun shining out here and playing and just sort of vary your colors back and forth and little Indian yellow here and there maybe yep right in there see so you can make all kinds of beautiful little effects that easy that easy there we go and maybe maybe tell you what maybe there's a sort of a hill right here that just leans over like that here once well you can touch a little bit of white just pure white let it mix with that color don't make it look like the sun's really shining through there say there begins creating that that feeling that is bending over here this is a super nice easy way to make a very effective little mountain very effective it's also an excellent way a lot of my a lot of my friends down in like North Carolina and etc say we don't have snow on our mountain this is a super way of making a mountain that doesn't didn't have snow like the big Alaskan mountains that I paint so often a little darker over this side cuz this is a shadow site maybe there's a touch running up through here but all you doing is just tapping it's very light tapping anything take a little bit of that same mountain color just define some of our edges here and there there we go wherever you want it maybe there's a little bit right in the hair it's that easy you have got one nice-looking little mountain it's very easy to do now with just a clean brush nothing on just a clean dry brush I just want to tap this to create the illusion of mist down here at the base want to be very soft very misty there just let it disappear right into nothing okay see okay shoot that was a lot of fun I enjoyed making little mountains like it tell you what let's do today today today this take the old fan brush and I'm going to mix up I see we'll try some black Prussian blue there's some Van Dyke Brown lizard crimson little SAP green shoot whatever you get just a good dark color here good dark color okay might as it makes up a pretty good little pilot we're going to use that over and over let's clean my knife oh now we'll use the fan brush let's go right into that color load a lot of color on the brush both sides see the old brush is very full there okay now maybe back here live some happy little trees all you got to do is take in touch and just tap it downward these are little distant trees that are far far away see how easy those are just tap it downward like so wherever you like to go that's the easiest nicest ways to make a lot of little trees very fast very fast can hardly go wrong if you get them too far apart I can't they'll begin looking like fence post down with that unless you want a fence back here if you want a fence back there that's way to do it fill them up a little more if you want to make it look like this water goes back let them get smaller as they go away from you small or small or smaller it'll give cavity illusion this farther away because your mind knows it as things get farther away from you they look smaller so you can create that that easy you can do anything here and we'll just throw some of that right here we'll let it will let that reflect right into the water right into the border so here take the brush grab it and because the liquid whites on the canvas this paint will move just pull it straight down straight down straight down straight down and then come across and that easy you have instant reflections you could take the same old brush go right into a little bit of the yellow just load it the same way a lot of color kingless now maybe there's some highlights on to some of these trees so all you got to do is tap the edge here on some of them don't do them all turn some of them here it makes it look like his light playing through there and shining on those trees and really makes them Sparkle that easy okay maybe shoot maybe there's some land out there let's take some brown take some handbag Brown little dark sienna on the knife pull it out flat cut across and we load that little roll of paint okay let's just go right up here and lay in some land see that once again allowed to get bigger down this way and it'll help create that illusion it it's going around the bin and going fatherfather away is nice so pretty okay I'll take a little touch of white little high little dark Sienna pull it out also very flat cut across and once again we have our little roll of paint it's so important you load that knife the correct way and that little roll of paints right on the edge of the knife then very lightly just craze in the canvas sort of let it bounce along here and there just barely touch don't don't kill all the dark that dark what makes it pretty just let that bounce along look like little rocks and stones and all kinds of happy little things back here we can take our brush it has the yellow fan brush and we can go back in here and let's just pop in a few little little grassy areas that live right out here on all this land that we made just push upward with a brush if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little touch a paint thinner for a little touch of the liquid white either one either one will thin the paint maybe touch a little bit of the titanium white and you can highlight some of those make them really Sparkle just a little touch of titanium white red on there like so okay yeah I'm gonna find by the fan brush here's one take a little touch of the liquid white on the fan brush and go into titanium white now put the liquid white on there only I'll need to thin the titanium white because you remember our golden rule that then paint will stick to a thick paint so this is a very firm paint up here now this thinner paint will literally slide right over the top of it and you can do this without becoming a mud mixer without all your color just mixing together so I'm just barely grazing the surface now this thinner paint is going to grab and it's gonna make it look like a little little Sheen coming across there a little light playing on the water there just barely barely grazing the canvas hmm it's very effective and you can do it all right now then I'll tell you what must do here we find another old brush I'm gonna go right in to Van Dyck Brown I'm just going to use this old two-inch brush just tap the Van Dyck Brown reach up here and get a little touch of the dark Sam I'm just going to tap it firmly really getting there bend that brush tap it hey let's go right here maybe right in here maybe there's a happy little peninsula that lives here so let's put in some dark comes right out like so maybe there's all kind of little things that live back here in the background there start at the bottom and work up and that way it'll get lighter and lighter as you work up you want this deep dark shadows down in here I'm going to add a little touch of yellow ochre right on that dirty brush so it gets lighter and lighter and lighter as it moves up here want to get much lighter there okay see already you can make out all kinds of nice little forms in there and they just sort of happen there okay now is the time you have to start making some big decisions are you going to go with this you're going to have a little Peninsula bland here where does it live maybe right there what the heck just drop it in wherever you want it okay let's have a little reflection right here there's a reflection pull it straight down and then very lightly go across very lightly and that'll create a nice reflection maybe right out through here get another little Peninsula the land all we're doing that is laying in a base color shoot you can do this with a paint roller can do it with your mop anything we're just laying in base color all we're looking for it's very basic shapes nothing else okay now then go right into Van Dyck Brown with the old knife and maybe there's a maybe there's a nice stone that lives right out here shoot big old stone little beaver lives out here and he's got to have a place to to sit and watch and see what's happening so we've give him a little little projection right there to set off some bland own doing here just laying this in with straight over Van Dyke Brown straight Oh van Dyke Brown okay maybe there's another little stone here wherever you want you could have some stones and the rocks and stuff maybe over here on the other side if you wanted oh shoot who knows there's a big stone glyphs here these things just sort of sort of grow wherever they're happy there we go we give him a little friend that lives there put a little bit of that down so you pull that down then it'll end up being your reflection a little stone needs a reflection out here in the water and these stones are growing if you're not careful they'll just get bigger and bigger till they turn into mountains there's another one okay yeah I'm taking very lightly pull that down same as before need those reflections and a cross over here same same cam we'll go to the little knife we'll go right into oh we got some black white and a little bit of dark Sienna I just want it to be sort of a gray grayish brown color like so take the little knife get that roll paint right out on the edge of it okay let's go right up in here let's just begin lights coming from the left so let's just begin laying in some little light things here there we go on the shadow side I'm using a blueish gray color just sort of pop him in say anything over here on this stone we don't have left out and these stones out here they too need some little highlights on there we go maybe the lights really hitting right in here and it's got some bright spots on it and Oh tans little things happening take our fan brush put a little water line right around this has a thinner paint on it has a little liquid white and titanium white see that thing is still under there all right I'm gonna grab another fan brush why just have all kind of fan brushes going I'm gonna go right into Van Dyck Brown and dark sienna just mix them right on the brush both sides fill it up then on the other side of the brush I'm gonna put it through here and just put white so I have brown and white eye light in the dark side Jane let's go up here now there's some trees live over here step touch and just pull down by double loading the brush you can make both sides of the tree at one time and you decide how many trees live here however many you want just throw them in maybe maybe you can't see all that when he's somewhere head back here a few little limbs here and there cane with a liner brush and a little brown paint on it you can go in here and put in the indication of a lil mal every so often where ever you want them their chemists use a little oval brush will go right into a little touch of that same dark color we used back here and just tap in an indication up a few little branches and lanza don't cover up all that nice background that you made though all you got to do is just tap in a few things and some highlight color on that for that we'll use yellowed some green and just tap in some nice leaves on these trees back here that's like so but you see how easy those are to make you just throw them right in just wherever you want them okay go to the old two-inch brush here I want to put the indication of some little grassy areas there they are look at that see greens and yellows yellow ocher Indian yellow all the lay of the land here once why you touch a little little tiny bit of the bright red see there you can create just a plane after plane layer after layer pretty little things wherever you are okay and use a fan brush and pop in a few that run right down here right down on the rocks and stuff I can't shoot let's have some fun here we'll go right back into our brown maybe their lives you know me I like old big tree right there alright it's a straight old Van Dyke Brown and with our liner brush I put in an old Elm here and they're just big old strong will wherever you want to like so take a little bit of white and sparkle up the edge make it nice and nice and shiny here okay and the old clock on the wall is telling me I got to finish this one up so let's just put in a few little leaves like so a little few little highlights on there use them to a yellow little green and you've got a beautiful little tree right here hope you've enjoyed this painting it certainly certainly teach you how to do some fantastic things from all of us here happy painting god bless you
