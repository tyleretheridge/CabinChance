hi I'm glad to see you again thought today we just do a fantastic little winter scene and I'll show you how you can do a very very nice little scene quite easily so let's have run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let's go on up here we have our standard old canvas up it's all prepared with a with a liquid white it's all slick and wet and ready to go so let's let's go to I think today I'll start out with a small touch of alizarin crimson just pull a little bit out tap the bristles firmly firmly firmly right there that that assures a nice even distribution of color all the way through the bristles good schooling up here now sometimes when you do winter scenes they can they can get so cold that they're almost unpleasant so I like to put a little tiny warm spot in my winter scenes and it's just a matter of personal preference if you want it to look colder just leave out this little touch of crimson because it's this is your painting if you do it the way you want it if you want to be very cold just leave that this one little bit right here and that'll do it a little touch more right in there now we don't want to set this guy on fire all we want to do is just put a nice pinkish glow in the sky something like so tell you what without even clean the brush I'm gonna go right into a small amount of it a little blue now the blue is so much stronger than the crimson you don't even have to clean your brush just go right in there and just tap it same way okay nothing let's come right up in here just dance it a happy little sky just use a little crisscross strokes like so like so there we go and bring it right down to the crimson once again the blue so much stronger it'll absolutely each of crimson up kill it there very lightly G we're going to have a little winter scene today so let's let's just go ahead and put some blue down here this wind up being shadows in our snow or or water or whatever I don't know just sort of make that decision when we get there there we go just drop it it's also a good way to clean off the excess paint off your brush shoes what we're doing that will here and there we'll drop a little crimson into just a little okay let's wash your brush scrub the old brush shake off the excess mmm and it just splatter everybody all right with a good clean dry brush I want to go right back up here where this pink and blue come together and very gently very very lightly just using the little crisscross or X strokes I just want to blend it so it's very smooth so you can't tell where one color stops and the next color starts just blend it then they click they're starting a light area and work toward the dark area okay and it gives us a nice quick little sky already let's do it let's do a fantastic Mountain today I'm going to start with some midnight black we'll take some Russian blue Prussian blue our little Van Dyck Brown in there what the heck little crimson whatever looking for dark color should look black okay pull the paint as flat as you can get it and then just take the knife and cut across get that a little roll of paint right out of the edge of the knife okay let's go right up in here maybe maybe I'll have a big mountain that lives we appeared this guy well it's a big son of a gun but this will give you some practice making mountains and if you can make mountains you certainly certainly made friends with a knife if you can make these mountains and you can take the same effects that you learn making these and create just unbelievable things rocks stones roads houses entire paintings can be done with a knife once you make friends with it so this is excellent excellent practice there and I lived in Alaska for a dozen years or so and I'm sort of crazy about mountains there's a lot of fun to paint okay after you have your basic outline on here take your knife and firmly tough with it scrape off all the excess paint you can't get it all off the value is in the fabric scrape off all that you can get off though and the more that paint you get off the easier the next step is okay now then we want to just this removes even more paint and blends it out and because a canvas is wet the painful move on here just grab it and pull firmly you're still trying to remove excess paint there we go firmly pull it pull it and then just blend it just blend it and you can soften points and Peaks okay that gives us a very nice little base to do fantastic mountain okay I watch the old brush again shoot that's the most fun of this whole technique it's just washing the brush you can take out all your hostilities and frustrations and anger and you can get all those bad feelings out just beating the brush okay I won't just take titanium white and once again pull it out as flat as you can get it just to really get tough and go down here cut across and our little roll of paint always loading a knife the same way okay let's go ahead up here now then you have to make some big decisions here where is the light striking your mountain touch and just let it flow right down the mountain see there no pressure no pressure I know you get tired of hearing me say that as I say it over and over but it's most important that's the number one problem that people experience when they're trying to to make this knife work is they get too strong with it take a week bill mmm very very gentle very gentle there we go get a little pull right there see and you should sort of just form your mountain decide where you want everything to live but it did because you can create all kinds of fantastic effects just let it flow right down the side one thing is we're really worth mentioning here notice the angles all these angles are basically the same cause of lights coming across here it's only going to hit on a given angle so that's sort of a good rule of thumb is keep all your angles basically the same they don't have to be exactly the same but basically the same you know there there we go maybe this comes around whatever wherever here we go fairly little pressure though that little roll of paint is actually all this touching the cameras the knife blade probably is probably is not even touching it except when you run out of paint maybe this one here comes right down like tap wherever you want it this is just straight titanium white now you could add a little color to it if you wanted to it's up to you okay then we'll take white alright let's use a little Prussian blue in it quite little Prussian blue blue oppression blue it's a very strong color extremely extremely strong color be careful with it okay yeah once again cut off our little roll of paint just like so now we can go back up in here and begin making big decisions as this peek behind that one if it is do this one first touch it just give it a little pull okay next one let it just gently flow no pressure no pressure right over it and see that easy it pushes that one back which is having bike tremendous power you have no pressure we'll just bring these together right here Jimmy yes sir let them flow together right in here we'll have some shadow basically for every highlight you need a shadow there we go just drop it okay maybe right in here it is another one wherever and you can just sort of work back and forth with your color here now you can firm up those edges maybe this one comes out here sort of comes around there it is I can do unbelievable things now behind this one once again we need a little shadow a little shadow that's right out here maybe the shadow comes buried in snow coos but just it's unreal I get a pain of a million mountains and every time I paint it when I get excited about it because it's just unbelievable watching watch right here maybe there it is maybe there's a peak it lives in there just putting me out see it doesn't look like too much right now watch what happens when you give him his own private pond shadow see once you give him a shadow then he becomes an individual just pops right out there that's bringing right on around like some and that fantastic what you can do and you can you can't maybe watch here see I just play some games today with mountain peaks anywhere you want to show a little peak just put it a little a little highlight and come back and drop it a little shadow see there we go there we go and you can put as many or as few as you want in your Mountain soda gun I don't watch out heaven we'll cover up his whole canvas with just layer after layer of mountain which is all right so super way to learn anytime that you learn you're not losing because of here's a secret to this style of painting or any style of painting it's practice that's all jazz practice I'm just tapping the base here to create the illusion of mist but follow the angles part of those Impossibles most most important most important like so there we go lift upward see you make it so soft and here you can just sort of bring it together try to keep my arm out of your way there just bring it together to soften it all out but you get what son of a gun in my mouth in there now then we got us a mountain let's begin working forward in our scene and see what we can make we can use that same old mountain color let's see what we got here into that let me add some white why don't you see what we got maybe a little more white there looking for a blue gray color like so yeah that's pretty nice color okay let me clean the knife off and and yeah yeah we use the old fan brush let's just go right through here with a fan brush I load both sides of it just like so just like so okay now maybe back in here lifts all kinds of little trees all I'm doing is tapping downward just tap down under the fan brush okay there it makes the indication of distant little trees just an indication we're not looking for a lot of detail because it's too far away let me get it to the foreground then we'll be getting worrying about detail look back here back here all you see our basic shapes Janis basic shapes maybe I don't wherever this is an easiest way I've ever seen making a lot of little trees very quickly very quickly you can paint a whole forest and maybe a few of them here and there maybe you can make out a little detail on just like so thank maybe there's another one here wherever you want to wherever maybe even in here there is 11 just drop him in maybe this one here we see you can make you something I'm gonna just grow right before your eyes there we just drop in a little color down here at the base same color then cover take our 2 inch brush maybe we'll have some water so all we do is fold straight down just grab that cover hold it straight down and it creates the instant reflection instant reflections go across and then take another fan brush and with just a little bit of white on it I'm just gonna touch here and pull up makes it like sort of an indication like his little trunks we back hidden there touch it just pull it straight up just touch it and pull it up if you get a little too much just keep working it and the color will lead up that white it'll go away just go right away maybe right there there we go wash off the old brush grab the knife touch a little bit of the liquid white pull it out very flat just as flat as you can get it and sort of sort of cut across let's go up in here and just begin cutting in a little water line there there you go see there all kinds of little things happening there there as many or as few as you want it's up to you up to you okay tell you what let's do grab the old fan brush again I think it's time to have some fun thank we'll have some fun let me clean off a spot here have too many things going on is one palette that's one thing you already mentioned I have people write and say thank they went out and got a palette and it's not like mine it's it's real clear my palette normally is crystal clear crystal clear but for television they make me they made me take sandpaper and sand it so it's not shiny if it was shiny all the lights would reflect off of it you would get big flares on your television but it's just like your palate even the the furrows on the brush are taped so they don't shine I'm just mixing up all the dark colors here okay tell you what let's do let's use the old one-inch brush today could do it with a fan brush or the 2 inch brush let's do the 1 inch mix I'll make some happy little evergreen trees pull the brush through the paint and wiggle it as you pull it wiggle wiggle wiggle and then sharpen it and that'll bring that brush to a super sharp chisel edge look at their sharp and it takes a lot of paint if you don't have a lot of paint on the bristles they're not going to stick together that's the only thing that holds these bristles together there's a lot of paint maybe right there see how sharp it is though you get a literally make a line with it let's take the corner of the brush and let's just make well just make us a happy little evergreen tree that lives right there tap downward using the corner of the brush as you work down the tree you use more and more pressure so you're using a larger portion of the brush but you start with one corner and you use that same corner all the way through the tree just sort of work back and forth back and forth okay to you it may be yep you're right you know there's a tree there there he is and just let him grow right out of the brush they live in there you have to sort of scare them out sometime but they're there they may be let's have a whole forest today give you a lot of good practice making some nice trees I think there is another maybe comes right on down wherever you want him so you just make him Rascals grow hmm there a little more paint and normally I reload the brush after each and every tree okay let's go over here on the other side maybe shoot I take let's get crazy yep maybe there's a big tree maybe he lives right there he goes clean off the canvas well that is a big son of a gun he called it X on these little s here Brando be a mountain oh that hurts if you spend so much time making a beautiful mountain and put a tree over down down down still tapping there hmm well I said big tree I wouldn't kiddin with it I will come back and we'll put some highlights on these trees all we're doing here is just just painting the back of the tree I tell you what maybe there's two big trees and in your painting you put as many or as few trees as you want cuz we each see nature through different eyes paint it the way you see it paint it the way that makes you happy because painting should make you happy it should set you free has no boundaries you can go anywhere you want to go into painting and do anything that you want to do can make any kind of world that you want can creat your vision and that's that's really that's the joy of painting is the fact that you can you can create gives you freedom gives you freedom and we're all looking for touch of that there okay I'm turning this whole painting into a forest that's all right though least we're getting some good practice making trees there's another one that's right there CFT finish this painting you won't ever again have problems making evergreen trees there we go now normally when I'm doing winter scenes I don't use any green in my evergreen trees mainly because if you're if you're having snow below those trees if you ever pull a little bit of the of the green into your snow it just it doesn't look right hmm breeding snow is just that's worth in yellow snow so I normally just use these dark colors with a blue base and then you can intentionally I'll show you if we'll put some snow in this you you know fun all right I take let me grab the old fan brush here I'll do let's do one with a fan brush you can see how maybe there's one that lives right here right here will show his whole trunk just by tapping all the way down there's this there's this little arm maybe this tree maybe he's not doing too good maybe he's a little sick little sick see he just has some little limbs living here and there but you can see a lot of his trunk poor tree something like so now they tell you what let's just go right in titanium white let's do some snow we don't we don't need all that water just I use the big brush here let's go right up here decide where you want your snow to start grab it and just pull be brave grab some of that dark color and pull it now you have to begin forming the land here see I want to grab that dark it makes nice shadows underneath the trees look at there then just play some of this white right over the top of it but see how easy it is to make all kinds of fantastic you little snowy areas it's smooth it's very smooth this is virgin snow here nobody's walking at you nice and smooth see there now a super nice way to make a little snowy area maybe maybe somebody wants to walk down here so let's make them a little path I'm going to take white a little touch of phthalo blue white just on the fan brush something like so okay now decide where do you want to walk here maybe there's a little path comes right down just sort of back and forth here and let it get bigger and bigger as it gets towards you as it comes towards you let it get larger where it is this Gill maybe right on over here there and you could make it as distinct or a soft as you want to your path you do with it as you please take a little a little white here watch it maybe I want to bring out a little little projection right there bring it right into the path like so can't tell you what I won't get a one inch brush here and we'll dip it right into a little touch of the of the liquid white and go right into titanium white pull it in one direction load a lot of paint into it let's go right up here maybe there's a little snow-covered bushes that live right up against these trees just touch it give the brush a little upward push do you need it against that dark so it shows up if you put it against just white snow you're not gonna get anything okay maybe there's another one right there little frosty bushes so easy those already make and they're beautiful little something it should look like a lace look just like lace we don't want this side to be left out let's put one or two over here there's one lives right out there you know this is uh this is the last show of the 12th series it's always sort of sad to come to the last show of I'm gonna miss you for a few days and we have another series already under production we've already started on another one so if you'll have us back I'll be back as I mentioned earlier there's now over 150 joy painting shows and if you hadn't got to see them all give you local station a call tell me you'd like to see them and they're available to them and I'd like to thank you for once again allowing me into your home I've had so many super super friends I've made and I appreciate it I really truly appreciate little phthalo blue and white on the fan brush I just want to come along in here and here and there put the indication of a little highlight on these just here and there not too much don't lose the contrast like so and with that I think this painting is finished once again thank you for allowing me to be into your home and until next time keep the old brush work at happy painting and God bless
