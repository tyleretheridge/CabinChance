- Welcome back, hope you
have your canvas set up on your almighty easel and you're ready to paint along with us. Thought today we'd show
you how to do snow. And we've had several requests, people asking us how do you put snow? How do you make it look
like the snow is falling? So I thought that's what we'd do today. So we're gonna start
out here with a little Van Dyke Brown and Prussian Blue, and we'll very quickly
throw a little Sky in here. And we're looking for a sky
that's sorta gray, overcast. So we'll sorta test it
and see how it looks, there we go. That's a nice gray color,
sort of a blue gray. We've already got the canvas
covered with the Magic White, so we're actually blending
color right here on the canvas. We're mixing a painting. Mixing a painting right on the canvas. Okay. Maybe just a little bit more right here. Put some life in this sky. If it's snowing, we have
all kinda things going on. And we'll gently hypnotize a little bit. Don't want to kill all the little actions that we've created in here. And we'll take a little
more of the same color and let's just lay in
a little bit of water. There we go. And we might as well make some
almighty mountains today too. What the heck. If you learn how to make
mountains using this knife, the knife will probably never
give you any more problems. Okay. (brush thuds) Okay, let's take some Titanium White and maybe we'll just
lay in some nice clouds that are just laying around
up here in the sky having fun. Dropping snow on us,
that's what they're doing. There we go. I'm using quite a bit of paint here. And you can put these at
any angle you want 'em. Probably at this point,
you're looking at that, and saying "my God, he's got
a mess going there today." But hopefully it'll come out. Okay. Now we'll take the almighty brush, and we're gonna start pulling this. Look at that. Instant clouds. But you need a good firm paint to do this, otherwise it's just gonna smear on ya. Okay, maybe we'll take, put a little gray underneath some of these. Take a little blue, brown and white. Okay, and just here and there, we'll lay a little touch of gray. Just to give it sort
of an overcast feeling. Okay, now let's work that in. There we go. Okay, let's build an almighty mountain. We'll take some blue and some brown, a little touch of Alizarin Crimson. And let's put us a nice
mountain right up through here. Maybe a little peak like so, and we'll just let that run right on off. Okay, with the big brush,
we'll pull that down. Okay, a little bit of Titanium White, and we'll lay some snow on here. Little bit back on this peak. There we go. Let this paint break, most
important that it break and let some of these
dark areas show through. Maybe another little peak over here. It's your mountain, so you can do whatever
you want to with it. Let these peaks just occur. Okay, we'll take some blue and white, make us a shadow color. There we go, and let's
lay some shadows in here, very lightly, just want that paint to barely touch the canvas and to break as it comes floating down through here. Okay, we'll give this
little peak his own shadow. And we'll lay a few little
shadows here and there. Oh, I see a little ridge right there, there he is. Okay, maybe we'll just
swing that around a little. Okay, now let's diffuse this real good, and all we're doing is tapping, don't want to destroy it. There we go. Now maybe we'll put another
range of mountains in here. We'll use the same colors,
but make 'em darker to give the impression
that it's closer to us. Okay, let's have one coming
right up through here. And we'll let him come
over, maybe like so. And let him fall down. Okay, take off all the excess paint. And here's what's nice, if you want to change a shape, change it. There. I like that a little bit better. Okay, we'll pull that loose paint down. Put some snow on him. Okay, let's go right over here and let this one come
down, work its way down. Maybe we'll just bring these together. See how you can put mountains together? Unbelievable amount of
power that you control, to be able to move mountains
and to change them. Okay, we need some highlight right here, and let's put some shadows in. See, another decision you have to make, is this peak on this side or that side? And if you want to push it back, all we have to do is
come down through here, bring that shadow right through it, and automatically he
goes into the background. There. Okay. Okay, then we'll diffuse this one. This feels nice and soft. Okay, let's throw in a few
little trees back in here, and we'll take a little brown
and a little touch of blue, and some white. And we want this to be very soft. So we're mixing a color that's almost the same color
that we've used here, and sorta lay it up against here and taste it, test it, make sure it works. And we'll put a little tree right there. Look at that little rascal, just jumped right off your fan brush. And we'll give him a little friend, there we go. And maybe over here,
one's a little bit larger. Maybe he got a little more
light when he was a baby. He grew a little taller. There we go. And we'll just take and pull up some little grassy areas running back, we'll just have it run
right on down like that. There. Okay, now let's put a little
bit of snow underneath him. Using just a little bit of white. Okay. And let that paint
break, very gentle touch just enough to get it
to come off the knife. And we'll take a little bit of this color, and we'll begin deciding where this ends. So we'll just lay some
little banks right there. Just like so. Then we'll catch ahold of
just the bottom of that, pull us a little touch of
reflection down into here. Okay, I want this to look misty, so I'm gonna tap back here. Just tap it and tap it and tap it. Lift it a little bit, just to create the illusion of mist back in the distance. Okay, let's come a little
bit further closer, we'll add a little more color, a little brown, a little blue. And maybe we'll put a tree here. Okay. And let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Okay. Now, we'll come just a little closer, so I'm gonna darken the
paint just a little bit more. As you come closer, let these
trees get darker and darker. Maybe there's one right here in the front. Just a little one. Okay, little areas of grass in here. Okay, now, let's take a
little bit of the Magic White, put us a little water line into here. And we'll just let this
sorta work around the corner. Okay. Little Magic White just to create the little water line here. And we got another little
hill coming right down, there. Okay, we'll pull this one
down just a little touch. Take the Magic White. Okay, now let's do something
on the other side here. And let's put a little tree right there. Here's far away too. Okay. Okay, let's give him something
to stand on out here. Maybe we'll have a little cliff, just sorta hanging around. There. Then we need a little bit of snow on top. Like so. Let that come all the way out there. And maybe then we have a
larger hill that's coming down. There we go. Pull a little bit of that down. Maybe over here, there's a place
that just sorta breaks off, snow doesn't hang right there. Just sorta, there we go. Okay. Put us some water lines around this. Let's take a little bit of white, mixed with a little Magic White here, just to make it a touch thinner. And just bring it right on around. There. Just some snow laying right along in here, up against that little cliff area. Okay, and then we can
bring this right on down. Make this like a little cove there. Any way you want one
of these little coves, really all you have to do is
just sorta lay a shadow in. We could put another
one in here for example, if you wanted to. And then bring it down, so it just comes right down to it. There. Okay. Now we'll put just a few more little trees right in here. These are getting closer, so they're beginning to
get quite a bit bigger. Just drop them in real quick. Need a lot of paint on your fan brush when you're doing this. Okay, some little grassy areas. And a little more paint on my brush. Let's do an almighty tree right here. Okay. This fan brush is a fantastic
little piece of equipment. Practice with it, use
it, make friends with it. It'll do things for you
that you wouldn't believe. But it's like everything else, you really need to practice with it. It has to be a friend. See, maybe you want to put
another little tree right here. That's all there is to it. Just decide where you want him, let him fall in. And we'll put some little grassy areas working their way down. This helps shield the lay of the land. Okay, let's go back over here a second, and I'll throw a couple more
little things right in there. Okay. Wash the brush, now let's take a little
bit of the thin oil, mix it with some brown,
just a little touch. And we want this quite light, don't get it get too dark on ya. And we'll just put in a few little sticks that are showing here and there. And the father back they go, the smaller they should get. And the lighter in color. Maybe back in here somewhere, just some kind of little
thing working around. There. Okay. There. And we can take the knife and cut a few little sticks in here and there. Just a few small ones. Okay, maybe we'll go up here and sharpen that point a little touch. Okay, let me wash out the fan brush here. And we'll show you how to make some happy little snow on this. I'm gonna take some Magic White, and thin it even a little bit thinner, using some paint thinner, so it's very, very thin now. It's almost the consistency of water. And if I may, I'm gonna
lay the palette down, so I can use both hands, and we'll just work off the
palette laying right here. Now we'll take the fan brush is loaded with a lot of very loose paint. We're gonna take here and
just flip this against, so it flips little
globules of snow up here. Can you see what's happening? That's all we're doing is just flipping it right against the fan brush. Isn't that something? Used to spend weeks
and week sitting around with a one haired brush trying to make all these
little snow things fall. And all you gotta do is
just flip this brush. Bend the bristles and make it pop. And we can create all the snow we want. Let's put a little bit more on here. There we go, look at all that snow. Got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Okay. Really suggest you do
this in an area though where you're not gonna cover
the whole house with snow. Nothing's gonna make your
husband or wife madder than coming home and having
a snow covered dinner. So, be careful where you do this. It does splatter and
go all over the place. And you can get carried away, and finally just cover up
the whole picture with snow. Nice, even distribution, there we go. Little bit more paint, I need some more right in here. And you can learn to
control this very well. You can have it hit just
about anywhere you want, you can make little bitty
ones or bigger ones, according to what type of
snowflakes you're trying to make. This old magic knife does
a little bit of everything. You just have to make
friends with it and use it. Now I'm getting into some real fine snow. This is also a nice way
to create a misty effect. You can keep working an area with very fine little globules of paint, and it makes a beautiful
little misty area, if you ever wanna do that. Once again, this is Magic White, thinned even thinner with a little bit of odorless paint thinner. Okay, let's go back up here and put just a little more in the sky. Okay, I think that's
enough to give you the idea of how to do it. (water splashes) Find my almighty palette again. Okay. Maybe, see one little area here I'd like to tinker with a little bit. I'd like to put a tree right here to sorta kill this area. I sorta left it open,
so that's no problem. You just go back and put you
one more little happy tree in. And then you'll have to put
some snow over the top of him to make him fit in to the
picture a little better. Okay. And that's basically how we make snow. So let's take and put a few more little
sticks here and there. Just let them go. Just let that, that just sorta
blends right into the mist and just sorta disappears
into the background. Okay. Now, maybe we'll put
just a stick or two here. Just a little bit. Oop, put a little tree here that just lost all his little leaves and stuff. Cold weather's got him. This reminds me a great deal of my home, it's quite often we see these areas where we can see the almighty
mountains and all the mist. Beautiful mist. There we go. And we can just take, put a little touch of highlight on that. Little snow laying here
and there on the tree. Okay. I think we're gonna
call that one finished. I hope you've enjoyed it, and when you're trying
this at home, once again, just take your Magic White, thin it down with paint thinner, and flip it on there using
the fan brush and a knife. Be careful where you do it, or you'll have a happy house that's covered with snow
from one end to the other. And until we meet again, thank you very, very much for watching us. Happy painting. (soft guitar music)
