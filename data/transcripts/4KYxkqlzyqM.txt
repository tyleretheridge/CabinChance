hey I'm glad you could join me again today today let's do one that's a little more complicated than a lot of them that we've done I think you'll enjoy it let's have them graphically run all the colors across your screen that you need to do this painting and they'll come across in the same order I have them on my palette I've already covered the canvas with liquid white it's wet and slick ready to go and I hope you are too so let's go up here and do it I'm gonna take off today with a little bit of the blue it's a little blue and into that I'm gonna add a little bit of Van Dyke Brown right into the blue just work it on the brush here just go ahead up here the house let's do a little happy sky here so maybe a little more Brown I want to dull that sky little there we go dan we did good today I thought we do a let's do a painting or some Docs it'll a lot of requests from people in Maine and Florida what you'd want some some boats and dark scenes so see what we can do here you know just have some fun and very quickly there we just throw in a happy little sky well I got this old brush go in same color Van Dyck Brown a little bit of a little blue let's go right down here once again a little there we go I just pull that across ready start at the bottom and work up and that way automatically it mixes with the liquid white and gets lighter toward the horizon and that's what we're looking for okay now I'm going to take a nice clean dry brush and just blend this guy out a little bit we always spend a bunch of time in the sky today I think I'll put some buildings in this one I'll show you show you a super way of making old wood some beautiful old buildings okay nice take your same old brush and go right into some titanium white pull it in one direction loaded full of paint let's go back up here now then just the indication of a happy little cloud or - there it is just floats around in the sky here and has just yeah just for the flame back a little bit more color there we go don't like it that'll give us and occasionally a few little clouds I use another clean brush I have several brushes going here so I don't have to stop and wash them all the time the cameraman gets upset with me when I watch too many brushes there we go they will lift that and we have some pretty big billowy fluffy clouds just floating around this guy here that easy okay now I'm going into some blue and a little touch of the midnight black okay let's go back up here now maybe back here this is a maybe like a little Harbor you can see a few little distant trees just use the corner of the brush and just put a few little indications here and there far far away far away touch pull downward a little touch of reflection underneath it just by pulling it straight down and very lightly going across it's time to clean a brush camera man's on his own that right in between here I want to tap this and create a little misty area and lift it up just that it all sort of blend together very softly I don't want to be will tell where one stops the other one starts very soft far far away and maybe a little closer here maybe there's a little bigger a bigger tree I'm gonna take some Browns and black and this case going up here now he lives I'm just having this one yeah look at there just drop it in like so and I'll go right into a little bit of the yellow just load a little color on there let's go back up here I just want to put some little indication of a few highlights in this one see I'm really not interested in a lot of bushes in this one so I'll just do this real quick there okay now that I think gives us a happy little tree wash the brush again there we are okay Allen I want to put a bunch of buildings in here show you an easy way of doing that mm-hm let's go right into some Brown here using the big brush this is Van Dyck Brown just go into it load a lot of paint into the bristles pull it pull it wiggle it that brings it to a nice sharp chisel edge and don't be afraid to load some paint into the brush we're gonna use a lot of Brown today look at that brush see how sharp it is good let's go up here Nathan we got to make some big decisions I think we have a building that lives right there there's the one of the eaves and we got to figure out where his roof is maybe it comes down I can't here's the other side I think how easy you could just sort of lay these out there's one and you're still at this point you're really not committed you're just having fun maybe there's another one comes there it is just bring all these together it goes this way and we need a front on this building just bring it right on down and whatever goes in there will turn into reflections we will just turn it right into reflections no big deal grab it over here pull it down Jerry I think you could make a building that easy using a big old brush you can you can't you can do anything baby right in here we'll pull that down I bet at home you say boy he has done it this time she has got a mess corner you may be right there we are I don't care some of that goes into the water it'll all turn into nice reflections eventually okay here's the roof and we're still not really committed we're not committed until we start putting all the little highlights on then we have to make the big decisions there we go now then let's put a few of those nice little highlights on there I'm gonna go right into some white same old dirty brush pick up some of this Sienna okay let's look at the brush look at there see all the colors happening in that brush okay let's go back up here now then this is where we start making decisions touch just barely touch and start working down and let the brush shake and tremble a little bit it really helps if you're a little bit nervous here look at there go back up here they just let it bounce along play already it's beginning to look like old old wood all words fun to make I like old wood I really like it better than new shiny wood looks better in paintings to me you just sort of layer this on you need that dark underneath though so this light color shows otherwise you don't you don't get it to show any much there now that will take the knife and let's put a few little indications of some boards in there I'll go right into the brown cut off a little hunk just a little tiny bit right on the edge of the knife all right yeah there a few little boards little slabs whatever you think they were to be all I'm doing is just touching the canvas just touch it touch it touch it soon but as many and or as few as you want but you need that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife I went in there this old carpenters like me he just picked up whatever was available didn't matter to him we had to figure out where this sides gonna be here maybe it's gonna be right there we'll start cutting that off you could paint this whole building with a knife I just sort of like this effect this is something I've been working on for a while I thought you would enjoy it too like this effect so now you have a dark edge there yeah let's put let's put some roof on there we use some blacks I've got a blue a little bit of white cut off a little roll of paint okay let's go up here now just gonna let that sort of just bounce along and play just let it just bounce we're still not too committed at this point same color a little bit lighter look at that old weathered when you're out here on the water you catch the devil this is where all the pelicans in the seagulls Park there a little bit of highlight right along the roof maybe touch lighter on this side so it shows up there we go I think you can see that a little better there okay yeah he said there was gonna be another building here so put that there pulling down and I can begin adding some highlights to that the dark Sienna a little bit of white just tap it okay let's go up here if your roofs gonna be right here touch it stay it wiggle as I say this is really where it pays to be a little bit nervous oh I'm just barely barely grazing the canvas just barely barely grazing it lighter to the bitter okay now into that I'll add a few boards these little boards just helped define give it a little more interest a little more detail look at there to all the little things and you put as many as you want in yours to maybe up here at the top it'd be a little more shadow so you put a little dark just let it bounce the long same over here a little bit of dark little dark okay now hey now comes the fun with a very dry brush grazing it just touch it give it to lease little ball barely barely touch apparently haven't been that sneaky look at that and you can pull it across like so to really make it look weathered and then go down crates all kinds of nice effects just here and there pull across and then go down very lightly thought you'd like that that really is a nice way of making old boards if you're making old barns or whatever okay we need a we need a happy door in here hmm just use a knife there paddy in real quick there we go just a little door take a little bit of a light color go around this makes the door stand out a little better can maybe tell you what maybe there's a little window right here just come across a little bit of brown white just to highlight him there you go now this nice old building here I wanted to find this edge a little bit more so it stands out this is where we need a little knife we can sneak in here this little nicety there bring it edge up here right here another big door drop it in go little brown and white got a little touch of highlight right around the door and that makes it stand out okay maybe there's some it's maybe maybe there's a walkway around here and it lives right here so I'm gonna just pull this out once again you don't care what's happening in here you're gonna need some dark in here for for shadows you can just lay any ol thing in there think you're right up between those buildings cut this off right there wherever you want it it's the old walkway here there's a little bit of that gray color just very lightly just enough to give it a little highlight come around little daddy's hair in there okay now with a clean brush I'll grab his dark color we can begin creating an illusion of reflections just like it now tell you what I'll just use a little bit of black here maybe there's a few if you hold post here you have something to hold that up there they go take a little brown and white touch a highlight on them just just touching it Thanks so now with a brush I'm gonna grab the bottom of those just pull them down go across and that quick we have we have some reflections like a little liquid white just sort of work a little that here and there just so it creates a little sheen of light playing across the water that makes it look like water that easy the head easy okay let's have some fun maybe there's another big building in here hello that two-inch brush back up and here it is there it's we'll just put it just make a decision throw it in shoot this is your world do anything you want to do in here now maybe he comes right down right down right down right down yeah just like so let's fill that all in here all I'm doing is just just basically covering up the canvas with paint you can bring it to any point that you want it don't want too much overhang here so I'll just make the building a little bit wider there we go wherever you wanting to be can't us have some fun on this old building to tell you what what we're doing that maybe maybe the walkway comes right out through here too we don't know I don't care there's no any way seeing that helps push everything back helps create the illusion of distance now then let's let's play a little bit here right into the dark sienna the white back and forth okay let's go up here let's do it touch just let this brush see it's just barely hitting can you see what's happening I want this to look like old old weathered wood look like old wood I really thought you'd enjoy this this is sort of a a neat neat waiter to do this just opens up a whole new world of old buildings now see this one in my mind over here was farther away so I smooth this a little more this one I'm gonna leave rough and I'm gonna leave it ragged because it's closer to you to see more detail can we use a little knife here in a little blue and it'll touch your white a little bit of brown pull it out and cut across tiniest little roll of paint out here okay yeah then I just want to just go right in here and just sort of move it back and forth so you get little chicks in there and take the knife and smooth that pull it in that angle if you want to create some shadows in this old building you can take a little bit of black on your brush and once again just let it bounce and tap into play there that's fascinating to me okay listen let's put a few little baby this is got some doers in here like yes see there a little bit of black on the knife or a brown either one whatever is dark I can't maybe here and there you can make out the indication of board whatever maybe there is gonna be we'll do it right there there's a window right there I don't know what all these old buildings already just looked nice so we drop them in right we put a little do where like yeah see and then sneaky now then tell you what let's do I put a happy little boat right here I'm gonna be right into the Venn diagram I'm using a number three fan brush Kenny let's go right up here now you got to make a decision where does he live well that's put him right there there's this front and he comes right around and goes around but then there's his back right now all we're doing is just laying in some paint she has to get a basic shape like so bring it around then the other side sort of see these things in your mind and he starts off really looking terrible there we go just begin forming him I think so yeah then we can begin playing a little bit add a little white to that brush and this is the front just a little bit more than white we gotta define where our edges are gonna be there it comes comes right on around a little bit showing on the back yeah very lightly I can't laying idea see us both sort of looking a little bit toward you it's not they haven't with a little of a dark color on the brush I want to just grab the bottom and pull down because there'd be a nice reflection underneath here and this is also the way you sort of straighten him up a little bit take out any you need to form it to he's you have and you boat sometimes I do some boots it has some deformities a little bit on the other side and we'll leave that very dark little light right there just enough to give us an indication pull that down like so very lightly okay now then leave a place for the fellow to set in there hung he's out fishing in this boat so I've cut across a little bit of brown let's go they're gonna give him a little little house here come up this way down that way see that's all he is to it give him a little place he needs a little place to sit I have it on this side over here little bit of teller on the other side let's go this way here just a little bit more and then let's put him adoring her he's gonna have a way to get in and out I'll use a little black hair on the small knife give him a little door right there remember this is sort of an angle you're seeing a three-quarter view so you wouldn't see all of it miss kima gonna have a window up here so you can see I want him to be driving around after blind shoot you probably drive like I do then so little the liquid white to that I'm gonna add the smallest amount of blue and brown just like there cut across it let's put a few happy little water lines around like so and you can put as many or as few of these in yours as you want just drop them in they help create the illusion of water make it a few of these little sparkles here and there down then up here take a least little touch of the bright red least little touch okay all right here just barely touch a little bit right there a little right over there just to put a little half a pyramid kind of have him a little happed maybe maybe maybe yep yep look at here maybe there's a little little mask up there yeah well we'll get crazy we'll do another one back here we kiss one bigger there we go these little touch of light on that oops just drop it in here and there just enjoy okay put a little thing across there yeah let's take a little liquid right cut to that cross in the night and this maybe there's a few little wires go right down here little little pieces of rigging soon some couple over here however many you want it's up to you there you go I'll give you an idea of a nice simple easy way to make a happy little boat okay back into my dark color here let's finish up this walkway put some color in there this is just just applying some base color right here really not worried about detail I'll tell you what tell you what I want a nice post right there nice big strong post put another one there so you put as many old post as you want on yours here's one there's oh there's another one look at all them son forgot so you've had a hard life out here maybe there's one goes right on off the canvas right there okay yeah a little bit of highlight touch give it a little pull just barely touch give it a pull there we go there we go all right here's one maybe yep maybe there's an old post it comes across there now you can just get carried away here and keep going and going and going just want to show you some ideas on on how to do some of these fantastic things for Julie enjoy it I'll go into my dark Sienna a little bit of the white just touch I had a little black to that I want it darker all right on there let's go up here I'll make this look like old wood follow the angles just touch it let it bounce you could you could you could you just let it bounce barely barely grazing the canvas there we go touch touch now this whole wood here a lot of people walked on it he wouldn't be as rough as this building it'd be a little bit smoother so to make it a little smoother take the brush very lightly pull it just barely touch it look at that now let's put to indication of a few boards here just tearing there I don't get bigger as they come toward you wider more distance between them there we go very lightly grab it give it a little pull you can also take a little less black and create the illusion of a few shadows we'll just pull it look at that take my knife a little bit of the red just for color sake and we'll put a little red right over top of these posts and I think we've got a finished painting and with that I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless see you next time
