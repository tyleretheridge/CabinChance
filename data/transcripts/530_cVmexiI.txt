haha hey welcome back certainly glad you could join me today today I thought we'd do a fantastic little waterfall you know we've done several waterfalls in the past but I still get hundreds of letters from people wanting to do waterfalls it seems to be one of the more popular subject matters so I thought we'd do one today I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coated the liquid white it's wet slick ready to go and now let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this project with me and they'll come across in the same order that I have them on the palette starting with a white and working around let's go on up here and get started I'm gonna start today with a little bit of the black and a little bit of phthalo blue and we just mix them together on the brush here blue and black just brush mix them okay let's go right up to the sky here let's just put a happy little sky in here just just dance the brush around let it play let it have fun there see it just make a little crisscross strokes with it and start at the top work downward that way it picks up the liquid white and automatically your sky gets lighter in value as you work downward there we go and in landscapes and landscapes you always want things to get darker as they get closer to you toward the horizon out here it should be much lighter in value while we have that old dirty brush here I'm gonna take an add a little bit of fatal green a little bit more of the blue a little black we're just once again just mix them on the brush let's go right down here we're gonna have some water down here let's just apply some color to the canvas maybe just like this in and we'll make the big decisions later where it's gonna be wherever right now all we're looking for is some nice dark color need the dark in order to show light okay yeah let's watch this two-inch brush and we wash our brushes with it odorless thinner and as I've said many times before it really really pays you to use odorless thinner okay shake it off I didn't just just to really beat the devil out of it cameraman told me for this start if I covered him one more time he was gonna walk out here and get me so he's about fed up with this okay now with a clean dry brush we'll just take and very gently blend all this together just blend it together be sure your brush is dry I've got a little hair right there I'll just pop it right off there if you get a hair on your canvas just take the corner of your brush and lift it off don't try to take it off with your fingers you'll you'll end up messing up your whole painting trying to get that rascal off there okay that's down here we really don't care much about right now it's just color alright I'm gonna take a another brush and I have several of them going so I don't have to continually wash them same brush it's just a two inch brush I'm gonna pull it right through some white and add a little red to that will brighten this up a little bit of red tiny bit pull that brush one direction loaded full look at all the paint is in the bristles good let's go up to the canvas I'll put a happy little cloud in the sky today I'm just gonna take the corner to brush and just just let it bounce around let him play that I'm have fun clouds are very free very free just let him go like so that my kid if that's enough clouds for this payment just throw them in let me clean the brush just scrub it off hope you do get a good wrap and you're in business again alright now I'm gonna use just the corner of the brush here and gently gently blend the bottom of this cloud I don't want to touch the top just the bottom blend it out a little bit to us blend it I want this to be a nice bright cloud just lives up here in the sky and has fun okay then that just cleans off the excess paint they painted I picked up just by beating the bristles you can you can clean it without going through the whole procedure now we'll fluff it up and very lightly this is just barely barely caressing the canvas just graze the canvas and that easy you have a beautiful little cloud okay now then let's have some put some little background trees in here and for that I'll mix up a lavender color we're using alizarin crimson a little bit of phthalo blue proportionately much more crimson than blue the blue is many times stronger so more crimson and blue alright let me clean my knife off and let's load up this little round brush and to do that all I'm gonna do is just tap it just tap it right there okay let's go up here now then decide decide where you want a happy little tree to be maybe there's one that lives right there thinking about the shapes lay in some very basic little shapes here we're just tapping these in just have fun let him go wherever you want this is your creation so you have to make these decisions make them different sizes in different shapes trees are like people they're all all different now then we can take a clean brush I want to create the illusion of a little mist here I'm just come on tap it just from the bottom just really raise Cain now if you happen to put too much color in here and it doesn't work add a little titanium white to your brush when you do it it's better to use just a little paint and allow it to blend with a liquid white this underneath though it gives you a much more natural appearance here then I'll just lift up a little and that creates the illusion of a little mist and if you go back we can take the same color and now we can add in some little bushes or a little closer and see that little misty area right there separates it it's the same color it's just that the mist separates and we can create several layers of little bushy things okay there we go and then maybe on the bottom of this one a little bit of mist also and you can create layer after layer after layer after layer of these just blend it out easy yeah then I'm gonna take my lighter brush it's a little bit of paint thinner on it time and I'm gonna go there it is right into a little bit of brown a little bit of Van Dyck Brown just turn that brush until it comes to a nice sharp point like yet yeah sure it is okay let's go up here can we put the indication in here or a few little tree trunks now this is quite a ways back in the distance so we're not looking for a lot of detail yet as we work forward then we'll begin worrying about detail back here we just want to give some indications decide how many trunks live in your trees put them in I think I said on one of the earlier shows it's almost unbelievable to me now that we have it with the completion to this series over 90 half-hour shows that's that's so fantastic if you haven't got to see all this shows give you a local station a call tell them you'd like to see them if you enjoy the shows I don't know that's the only way they have of knowing they have a go because all the past shows are available to them they can get them if they're they know you want them ok yeah we've got the indication of some tree trunks let's take I'll just use the same old dirty around brush mode we're right into a little bit of the yellows little yellow ocher pick up some SAP green same old dirty brush I don't care just tap it in okay let's go up there now then this is far away I don't want a whole bunch of highlight I just want enough so you can make out a a little indication of some color here and there don't overkill this works so nice it's easy to get carried away and you cover up all the dark areas and you lose you lose the depth lose the distance little yellow ochre and into that same cover right there see I'm easy and then you can just begin deciding where they are but it all kinds of happy little things there's one and just think about shape here when you're doing these don't just judge me don't you just hit it random think about shape it's like when I was a kid my uncle used to tell me you know I wanted to catch a rabbit he said well he said you could stand behind a tree and make a noise like a carrot when he comes by you grabbing so that's what you got to do here you think like a tree I didn't catch many rabbits if you're interested there we go maybe down here there's some little ones okay yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't want catch a little rabbit anyway I think you're too cute alright enough for that enough for that now then and gives us a nice little background and all we're looking for it's just some background so we can we can really concentrate on the waterfall gonna go right into some good dark color maybe our waterfalls gonna be in this area somewhere and maybe it's gonna drop right off in there how's that just drop it off wherever somewhere in there and then we'll have some dark color down here we really don't care at this point let's take some rayon we'll use some Van Dyck Brown and some of the dark sienna mixed together just mix it right here pull it out very flat cut across see there's a little roll of paint you can see it a little tiny roll of paint right on the edge of the knife I guess go up here now with that that let's put some stones and some rocks and something's got to contain this water I'll always remember this water has to be contained otherwise it'll just run everywhere I've got to have some stones and rocks and all kinds of little little happy things okay yeah then we'll take a little white little Luciana color mix it together I mean I'll put just the least little touch of red into it like it just cut across let's go up here and let's put let's put a few little highlights on our stones a may come across just let it sort of bounce around and plate this is such a delicate touch you're just hitting the high points that's all you're hitting I have enough time to get in here with a fan brush and have some fun and how we can start building some water now one of our one of our golden rules a thin paint will stick to a thick paint so I take a little bit of the liquid white and then mix into the titanium white right on the brush a lot of paint the brush is really full of paint okay let's go up here yeah start thinking like water your water is coming right along here to play and have fun there water's just it's just flowing along this little river just like so just just it's having a superdate just taking life easy and coming along here and then and then right about here oh boom somebody pulled the stopper out and it fell and take the fan brush come across and then drop it down and it helps it helps to make little sounds like it and you have to you have to make a determination now how long is your waterfall if it comes to right here then take your fan brush and watch here go in push and Bend it upward there see and that makes that foam up here on the top there give it a little push sometimes it levels out a little any boom may I say it really helps to make all these happy little sounds and think like water Harriet goes I have to be careful I get Carrie Lee and cover up the whole canvas but and sometimes there's little stones that you can't see under here and they make it go Boop and cause other little things look there you need this little sound so they they really help there so you gonna need a little effective okay enough that I get carried away I'll take the old fan brush here I'm going to some of my yellows little green just back and forth back and forth let's go up here now then home to bring all these rocks and stuff together so I'll push Bend that brush just like we did to make the foamy water we'll make some indications of some happy little grassy areas that I just live in right there if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little bit of paint thinner or a little bit of liquid white to it and let's just disappear back in here see it goes right back into that mist I don't know where it goes don't care alright and that's one of the simplest little ways there is to make a waterfall now let's put something here to contain that water once again you have to keep keep it in the school right up here and maybe this comes right around like kiss and there's a big oh yeah there it is looky there looky there Bob you just messed up now I'll put some big old stones right there laughter there this is just straight Van Dyke Brown quiet a bit of pain take it to that there we don't know now we also need something on the other side if we're gonna keep this water contained I don't want to lose all that so maybe we'll just let it pop up come right across like yeah there we go just let that wherever make some decisions just let this fall right off your knife I don't want to lose that pretty little thing there that was a nice happening see a lot of times little things happen that you didn't really plan and they a lot of times turn out to be the nicest part of the painting watch for him if they happen treasure them hang on to him hey there we go there then some take a little a little the brown and white mix it together about like so pull it out very flat cut across and once again I have a small small little rule of paint right on the edge of the knife let's go up here I want to make the top of this sort of flat looking so I can plant some bushes and stuff up here so just grazing it and angles are very very important very very important maybe there's a Ledge it comes right down through there look at the angle though the angle is more important than any other thing in this you want to keep us looking halfway level I have a flat let's do the same thing basically over here yes maybe this one's got a big thing just sort of let it happen and see what happens and go from there they're all right now then I'm gonna take a little bit of white some blue some black mix up a very dark color if I'm gonna use a little knife cut across we get that small roll of paint on yet also just a very tiny one yeah a little knife it comes in handy for getting into little places like yes using almost no colour though just begin looking making determination see how of it that's what separates maybe this one here comes out and then goes bloop no pressure very little paint I want to keep this area very dark very dark same thing over here just let it bounce so long to play sometimes you can grab it and go this way all kinds of happy little rocks there is something right there just wherever you want it just to give some happy indications that's all you need there we're all right now let's use a a little more of the liquid white and some titanium white and we can begin bringing some water up around the foots here and hit it splash feel to make it look like waters dripping down do it backwards take your brush and go you see there it looks like it's coming down sneaky huh we like it I'll just bring it right on down here there some there maybe that just keeps right on coming there wherever you want it all these happy little things I had it go through here I'll let her decide what else is gonna be in this painting just keep playing on this water and having fun I'm gonna have a whole canvas full of water tell you what tell you what maybe there's a some nice big trees that grow over here on the side I just got an old dirty two-inch brush here I'll use some Brown some crimson some SAP green it doesn't matter whatever load a lot of paint into the brush just go up to the canvas now start thinking about some basic shapes maybe there's a happy tree and he lives right here and his arms just hang out over look at that and it's really nice if you don't get too carried away and you let some sky show through it really helps gives painting a little more depth makes it a little more interesting yes that's some sky hang through okay we're gonna put a bullet there there he is okay we'll separate all those with with highlights no big deal at this point and a big thing here you're just looking for a dark color it's no no biggie whatever you have just whatever don't worry about it too much nice dark color baby will bring us down there you want I think the other side or to have some too we don't want it to get jealous maybe there's a beautiful big tree that lives here he hangs out things out that's what he's doing as a teenager just hang out that was the most exciting thing to do I guess it still is yeah one of the earlier shows we showed you some of the paintings that people are doing along with us oh I think that's so fantastic I'm looking forward to doing that again let me hear from you let me know if you like seeing what people all over the country are doing with this fantastic fantastic painting method let me know in a few if you enjoy seeing that kind of thing I'll continue to bring you some more because we get all kinds of letters with paintings and some of them are almost unbelievable and I'd love to share them with you alright we'll go into a little bit of brown I'm gonna load the brush with brown and then then I'm gonna go right down here and load one side with white okay so I have brown and white see there okay let's go up here now let's put let's put some little trunks in here there are double loading the brush the brown and the height you get both sides of the trunk at one time didn't that sneaky for us lazy people it's great and that it's me there maybe maybe maybe there's a little man lives in there saying you don't have to be too careful here because the leaves are going to cover most oh so you know you don't have to spend a lot of time worrying don't take a little bit of liquid light maybe right in here there's a happy little little thing it lives right there like so and you just put as many I'm in here as you want wherever wherever don't decide to get jealous keep the continuity here a little bit just put one over here all right now we need we need some dirt down here for all this to settle I'll go right into some brown really all right just lay it in make a decision where you want it and drop it in you know so many of these shows are designed from cards and letters that we receive and people they tell us what they want to see so if you have a favorite subject or something drop me a line let me know what you want to see if I can't do it son of a gun maybe we'll just go out and find somebody to kin yeah we see a little bit of highlight on there just touching with a light color barely grazing the canvas don't overdo don't all we do just bear to touch it I want to kill that nice dark hair ain't you put in there all right tell you what let's put some let's put put a little of a liquid white go right into some yellow a little SAP green and we'll load this brush by tapping attacking you see that here you go tap it now let's go right up here yeah this is where we put the sparkles on the tree heyy the little leaves all the all the little goodies I'm gonna add a little paint thinner to my brush to make it paint a tiny bit thinner and paint sticks to a thick paint just drop them in wherever you want them now I'm gonna grab a I want hitch brush also we said it back here use a little yellow and some red there was a little bush it lived out here on this stone there he is you thought I'd forgotten didn't you see there he lives right there yeah more things on this tree and you put as many leaves in yours as you want let's put some on the other side there they come just let him drop right off that brush I'm using mostly the corner of the brush going into CAD yellow bit a bit of yellow ochre once in a while some Indian yellow whatever just all the yellows and reds and just let it bounce around and play there okay now down here let's put some individuals I'll use this thing with one-inch brush so yeah hello some green there pull it through a load a lot of pain in that breast yeah see there Cass go up here maybe there's a happy little tree it lives and put some form and shape in your tree just don't throw him a parrot random put some put some goodies in there there's another one he's got a little friend he's lives right here live here next to this waterfall they get all kinds of moisture oh they have the good life there we go maybe right out here there's one that's got a little bit of overhead in it all right there a little bit more wherever you know just drop these little rascals here put a few on the other side don't overdo okay drop in a quick one right there let it work right down let's take the old fan brush take the old fan brush pop in a little bit of water right around this foots down here now we're on the verge of having a completed painting and I hope this is one that you like shows you how to make a happy little waterfall and you too can experience a joy of painting so until next week from all of us here happy painting god bless
