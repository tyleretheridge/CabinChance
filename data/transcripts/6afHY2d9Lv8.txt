- Welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me
today. It's a fantastic day here, and I hope it is wherever you
are. So I'll tell you what,
let's start out today and have them run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint
along with me at home. While they're doing that, let me
tell you what I've already done here. I have my standard ol'
18 by 24-inch canvas, double primed, pre-stretched
canvas, and I've covered it with a thin, even coat of the liquid white, so it's all wet and slick
and ready to go so let's go. I thought today we'd just do
a beautiful little painting, maybe we'll do something with
fall colors. It's a good day so let's just, let's start out and do a
very simple little sky. Very simple, nondescript-type
little sky. We'll take a little
bit of the yellow ochre on the 2-inch brush, very small
amount. Maybe just go up in here, and let's just begin
blending in some nice warm little colors here. This is just yellow ochre, but it's mixing with the liquid
white, and it'll be very pale
and very, very soft. There, maybe a touch more color right about in here, wherever,
wherever. There we go. Now then, tell you what, tell
you what let's take a little touch
of the alizarin crimson on the 2-inch brush and some very small amount. Just pull a little bit out and tap the bristles firmly into the
paint. That assures a nice even
distribution of color all the way through the
bristles. Okay, now then, maybe right in
here we'll put a nice little warm
spot, little pink spot just like that. And we're using little
criss-cross strokes or little X's like that and just blend that color right
in. Once again, this is gonna be
a very nondescript little sky very, very soft. You won't hardly even notice
it when the painting's done. There. Now we just blend that
crimson and ochre together. Let's have some fun. Tell you what, I'll take the
knife and we'll mix up some lavender or purple color. We'll take some alizarin
crimson, a little bit of phthalo blue. Now, proportionately much,
much more crimson than blue. The blue is many, many times
stronger. Pick it up and turn it all the
way over if you really wanna mix it well. Now we can take a little bit
of white and lay out here and see what color we have. There, okay? Sometimes it's very difficult
to tell what color that is without putting a little white
there because it's gonna look
just basically black, so put a little bit of white, and then you can test your
color. We'll put the small
amount of that lavendar right here on the 2-inch brush, and maybe there's a little
cloud that floats right in here. There, just tap. It's all we have to do. Put in a very basic
little idea of a cloud. Maybe right in here we'll put in
a little little color like so,
very soft and very gentle. There. Now then, with a clean brush
we're just gonna brush this, so I have several brushes
going so I don't have to wash them between each
procedure. There we go and that easy we have a very nice, very
effective, soft, little sky. Now then, I'm gonna continue
to use this 2-inch brush. I'll go right into that lavender
color. Maybe we'll make some
little background trees. I'm just tapping the
corner into the paint. I don't want a lot of paint on
the bristles, just a little. Okay, let's go right up here. Now then, begin thinking
about some very basic little tree shapes, and we're not looking
for a lot of detail here. This is too far away. If you put too much detail, you'll lose that illusion of
distance, so be very careful, very
careful. It starts working and it feels
good and you wanna just, oh you get carried away, there. But we want this to be
very soft and very distant. There we go. And think about little
individual trees and bushes and all kinds of little shapes
here and just sorta let your
imagination take you wherever you wanna go. There, hmm. That looks soft and far away
already, and we haven't hardly done a
thing to it. Now if you wanna create more
mist at the base of this, we'll take a clean, dry brush and tap the bottom of these
little bushes and trees but just the bottom, just the
bottom. And very lightly, two hairs and
some air. Touch and lift upward. There we go. Now then, maybe we want to
put several layers in there. That's pretty easy to do also. We'll take a little bit more of
the color on the 2-inch brush and tap firmly, tap firmly. There we are. Now then, we can begin putting
in the next layer. Now this is a little bit darker. Each layer, as it gets
closer to you in a landscape, should get a little darker. There we go, maybe right here. Wherever you want, just drop
them in. Okay, it's fantastic already, I
like that. I think it's gonna be a pretty
one. These little distant trees are
so easy and so much fun to make. There. Now maybe back in here
we're beginning to see the first indication of
a little bit of color but very small amount so I'm going to do a little
touch of the yellow ochre, maybe even pick up a
little bit of bright red. We'll have a fall scene today. That sounds good. Okay, now then, let's just
begin. You're still using just the top
corner just tapping in the indication
of a little bit of color. Not too much or, once again, you'll lose that illusion
of distance and depth. There, just a few little
indications. Maybe there's one right here or
wherever. And I think today that's
about all we need. Now under here I must
have a little grassy area, a little grassy area. So I'll just take a little bit
more of that same lavender color. Decide basically where
your little grassy area is gonna live, and let's come right up in here, and all you have to do is just
tap it in. And this is just the dark so
our light color will show. It's all we're putting in right
now. Doesn't matter how you put this
in. You could put this in with a
paint roller, doesn't matter. Any ol' way you wanna do it. There. Tell you what, maybe down in
here there's a little bit of water. You know me, I love water. And it's so much fun to paint with this particular technique. We'll take a little bit
of the phthalo blue. I'm still using the same ol'
dirty brush. There we go. And let's just come right across
here. I don't want much water in this. Maybe just a happy little pond way back in the distance
somewhere. So I'll just take a
little of the phthalo blue and come right across here like
so. Okay, now we wanna reflect a
little bit of that in there, so I'll take a little bit of
the lavender color, same color, touch and just pull it down. Same lavender color, not a great
deal. Just enough to indicate
a little reflection. Straight down, though. It's most important that these
lines come straight down. If they go at an angle,
it's gonna bother the eye. It'll drive you crazy and
maybe you won't even know why. There. Now then, same ol' brush. Still haven't washed this ol'
brush. We'll take a little yellow
ochre, a little Indian yellow, cad
yellow. Just mix them together. This is gonna be a fall picture. We want a lot of the nice pretty
colors. Maybe even a little touch of
the bright red here and there. But mix these colors on your
brush, and that way you get a
multitude of things happening on your brush rather
than one ol' dead color. Okay, let's try that. See what we have here. Let's go right up here
slightly above the dark area, and think about the lay of the
land here, the way the land flows, and we'll just begin dropping
in some happy little things. There, all kinds of
little happenings here. And this is far away, so we're still not looking
for a lot of detail. All we're looking for is
basic shape and color. Alright, maybe there's
a little land back here. Let's take a little bit
of the Van Dyke brown, a little dark sienna mixed
together with a knife. Pull it out as flat as we can
get it. Just really pull it out
flat then cut across and get our little roll of
paint. There, you can see it right
on the edge of the knife. Now then, up in here, up in here let's just scrub in a
little bit of land area. Don't want a lot. Don't want a lot, just
enough to give the indication of a little bank there or
something. There. Now then, go into a little
touch of the liquid white. Maybe add the least little
touch of phthalo blue to it just to cool it down a little
bit. There. Pull it out like that then cut
across. That's all there is to it. Now we go up here and act like
you're trying to cut a hole
right through the canvas. And we'll just cut in a little
water line. There, it's just a light
area between these darks, and it sort of separates and
makes things, just makes things look better. There. There might even be a little
ripple or two out here. We don't know. In your world, you make these
decisions. You decide where all these
things are. Okay, now it's time to really
get crazy. Let's take the ol' big brush. We'll go right into that
lavender color we made, and I'll add some Van Dyke brown
to it. Shoot, maybe even some black. Make a good, strong, dark color. A lot of paint in the bristles. Now then, let's start deciding how our land is gonna flow here. Maybe it's gonna come right
about here. And all we're doing here is
just tapping in some color. Maybe there's some bushes
that live right there. Just push upward with the brush, and it makes all those
little bushy effects. Let the brush work for you,
shoot. Maybe the land comes, maybe
it comes right on up here. I don't know. Just make a decision in your
world, and put it wherever you want it. There, maybe that's the
way our land will be today. Now we can just really just
paint this in just like we're painting a barn,
shoot. Just wanna cover this
with nice dark color. There. Okay. When you're using a big ol'
2-inch brush, it doesn't take too long to do
all this. You can just sorta throw it in. Okay. And maybe we want some trees in
our world. Maybe we'll have, maybe
we'll have a lot of trees. But it's up to you. When you're doing your painting,
you sorta look around and decide what you
want. 'Cause you can create any
kind of world that you want. We'll just take the same
ol' brush, same ol' brush. We'll go through those same
colors. Get some crimson. Maybe we'll add some sap green,
too. That's a beautiful color. There, just pull it
through in one direction. One direction. Now see that creates
a curve on that brush. See that round curve on the top? We wanna keep that curve on the
top. Let's go up to the canvas. Now, maybe we can bring the
camera in here real close, and when we touch, we wanna give it a little push. Give it a push. See that happening? See? Push. And you can create, looky there. There it is. You can really see it now. But see that push? That's what creates all those
beautiful little leafy effects. Maybe there's a bush
that lives right here. Got a friend there. Wherever, wherever. Don't be afraid to experiment,
though, when you're painting. Sometimes you learn more
from making mistakes than you learn from really
trying to paint a beautiful masterpiece. Your mistakes can also, let's go up here, right up here. Let's make one way up in the
sky. There. Maybe there's a big tree
that lives right up here. He looks around, and he watches the little pond
here and all the little creatures
that live around the pond. 'Cause you know there'd be
all kinds of little things around the watering hole there. You'd have ducks and squirrels. Hope you got to see my little
squirrel I showed in one of the
earlier shows of this series. He's a character. Actually, it's a she. Something else, though. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll
bring the squirrel back in one of the later shows
and let you see her. There we go. And I have raised her since she was just a tiny little
critter. Didn't even have her eyes
opened. There. See, and we have a great
big tree now, that easy. Big ol' tree. I'm getting carried away,
now let's have some, let's really have some fun. I'll go back into all these dark
colors, just pull them out here. Maybe there's a whole clump of
trees lives right here. I don't know, wherever. But push that brush, bend it. Don't let it slide. Look here, if it slides. See, that's what you're gonna
get, and we don't want that. Look at the difference. See that nice open, leafy
effect? That's what we're looking for. That's what'll make your
painting special. The only time we use a sliding
effect that I can think of right now is when we're making like saw
grass that lives in the water. There. Sometimes we're painting scenes from Florida, Louisiana, et
cetera, you have that beautiful grass
that grows in the water. And that's the way you make it. There. You see, that easy you can block in a whole forest
basically. And you begin seeing things,
things. This is almost a natural place
right here for a little path to live. We'll think about that. We may put a path in there. What the heck, what the heck. You know, in this style of
painting, you really don't have
to make big decisions, and you look at your work, and you decide what do you see
in there. And then you take that and work
with it. And that's where you really have
your fun. That's where you really become
creative. Let's take a fan brush here. I'm gonna take both
sides through some brown and then take one side
through titanium white. There we are. So we have white on one
side and brown on the other. See there? Okay? Now then, we have to make
a decision right now. Where's our light coming from? If you're right handed,
you'll probably find that it's easier to have the
light coming from the right. So put the light side on the
right side. Hard to say in one mouthful. And just pull down. And we can put a whole tree
trunk in there in one stroke. Both sides, the highlight and
the shadow, in one stroke. See there? Sneaky, huh? Maybe over here, maybe there's
several trees over here. So you decide how many trees live in
your clump or group. You decide. And maybe you can't see the
entire trunk of all of them. Maybe you can only see
that much of that one 'cause maybe there's a big
bush here, I don't know. Just use your imagination. But you don't want every one
of them to be exactly the same. You don't want each one of them
to be perfectly straight. It becomes very boring very
quickly. Maybe, maybe there's a
limb here on this one. See? Just whatever you want, though. Maybe over here you can
see a little teeny one. Gotta have small trees or
you'll never have any big ones. Okay. Now then, today let's use a, let's use a 1-inch brush, and I'm gonna dip it into a
little bit a little bit of the liquid white and then we'll go through color. We'll start with yellow. I'll reach up here and
get a little bit of black. Tell ya what, a little red. We just, this is gonna be a fall
scene. We need a lot of beautiful
colors. There's some yellow ochre, shew. Put your sunglasses on, this
one's gonna be a bright one. But pull this brush in
one direction like that. And once again, see the rounded
corner? That's what we're looking for. Put that rounded corner to the
top. Let's go right here. Go slightly above the dark, and very gently, very gently, begin laying in your shape of
your tree. Now remember this tree is not
flat. It has roundness this
way as well as this way. So think about shape and form when you're building your tree. Don't just throw a bunch of
color on it 'cause the ol' tree will come
out looking flat as a board. Give him some character. Let each tree be an individual,
there. They're like people. They wanna be, they wanna be individuals. Now sometimes when you have fall
scenes, maybe Jack Frost doesn't get all
of it and there's still a little
green here and there. Some plants never turn colors. So let's have one of those right
here. Just a nice one that has
a little green in it. And maybe he's got a little
friend that lives here behind this
bush. We don't know. But once again, and I know you get tired
of hearing it all the time, do one bush at a time. Don't be in too big a hurry. I'm gonna leave some of these
dark things sticking up back here. They'll be, they'll be nice. And I'll go into my yellow
ochre, a little bit of cad yellow. Let's go up here to this tree. And maybe up here in this tree maybe, maybe, yep. There's some beautiful
colors up in in here, too. But once again, think
about shape in this tree. So, so important. There. Think about form. There, right across the trunk. 'Cause you don't see the entire
trunk in a tree normally. In nature, there's just about
exceptions to every rule, but normally you won't
see the entire trunk. There we go. Maybe back here there's even
a little, we don't know. Let's have some, let's
have a firecracker there. Shoot, let me go into a
little bit of alizarin crimson and then the yellow. Alizarin crimson and then some
cad yellow. We gonna make a, we gonna make
a firecracker right there. That'll be pretty. There, pull the brush in
that one direction, though. Now then, maybe right in here
lives, ooh that's nice. That is nice. There, there he is. He just hangs out here around
the pond. There. Maybe even a little bright red
down here. Mmm, beautiful little bush. Okay, there's a little bit over
in here. There he is. Practice some with this brush,
though. You'll be surprised, probably be amazed at what you
can do with a brush like this. I'm gonna go into a little
more of the liquid white. If you have trouble
making your colors stick, add a little bit liquid white or a little bit of paint thinner but a very small amount of paint
thinner. The liquid white now will
change your color a little bit. Make it brighter. Okay? See? Just have a little bit of green
there and we'll go right here. Maybe there's a happy little
bush that lives right there. Vary these colors, though. In the fall you have every
color that you can imagine. There. Shoot, while we have that
green, maybe over here there's a nice little bush
that lives right there. There we go. But you can begin creating
all kinds of effects. Tell you what, tell you what, let's go back into our yellow
ochre, maybe I'll grab some bright red. Whoo, that's a pretty one. That's a pretty one. Alright. Let's go right up in here. Now sometimes these big trees have a tendency to scare you. But just remember that large trees are nothing more
than clumps of bushes put together. It's just a whole group
of little small bushes that got together and made a big
tree. And work on individual
shapes inside of this tree. Think of each limb, for
example, is just a bush. Just a little bush that's
sticking out there. And don't be afraid to
reload the brush often. Probably the biggest mistake
made is not thinning the paint enough and not putting enough
paint on the bristles. There we go. And if you don't have enough
paint, then you have to hit very hard, and it'll, it'll just
sorta moosh together. There we go. See how you can create all
those different effects just using an ol' 1-inch brush? There. And leave some areas open so you have some of these
dark things showing through. Let a little trunk show
through here and there. All these things are, they're what make your
painting interesting. Make it stand out. There, another little bush down
here. Another thing that would help
your painting be special, any time you have a large
clump of trees like this, this area right in here, you need a dark shadow area, very dark shadow area. Tell ya what, let's go in here. Let's go in here. Take that ol' 2-inch brush,
tap in a little color, and let's just begin laying
in the lay of the land here. Little grassy areas, soft little
areas like that. Very soft. Bring this all together. There. We said we might have
a little path in here. I think that's an excellent
idea. We'll put in a little bit
of these grassy areas. I'm just gonna drop in a little
path. Now see by changing the angle
here, changing the angle we can
create different plains. There we go. Just like so. See? But just by tapping you
can create all of these little illusions of all these
things that are happening, and by changing the color a
little bit, changing the intensity or
the brightness of the color, you can create different
plains in your painting. Let's take a fan brush. We'll put a little bit of little bit of brown on it, little Van Dyke, little dark
sienna, and let's just begin creating
the illusion of a little path. Look at that, there it comes. There it comes. And that way you clean up the
bottom of all these little things, make them any way you want them. Add a little white to the brush. Then you can come back in here. There. I like to do this with
sort of a rocking motion 'cause it makes it look like the
path is sort of worn there in the
center. There we go. Alright. Now then we can come back, add a few little finishing
touches wherever we want them. Maybe right in here there's
another little bush. And you can take this
brush sideways, push upward and it'll create all kinds of
little grassy-looking things, little bushes that live right in
here. We'll have them work right down
the side like so. And bring all this together. Alright, hmm. Now then, with just a clean
knife, all I'm gonna do is just
go in here and scrape in the indication of a few
little sticks and twigs and all these little happy
things. But these also help
create that illusion of depth and distance in your
painting. There. Okay, now we can take our liner
brush and go into a little bit of the
brown, but we want this paint
to be thin like ink. And let's go up here. Maybe there lives some
little sticks and twigs and just little extra things all
over here like that. Okay, tell ya what. Think this one's about finished. Let's take a little of the red. Let's come right in here, and we'll sign this one. Certainly hope you've enjoyed
it. It's a very nice little
painting, and I think you'll enjoy doing
this one. And from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy
painting and God bless, my friend. ♫Interlude
