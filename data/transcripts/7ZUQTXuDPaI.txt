hi I'm glad you could join me today today I think we'll do a painting that I've had a lot of letters requesting a lot of people have written and said in love I'd like to know how to do a very simple little sunset so I want to show you how to do that today it's going up and let me tell you what I've already got done today we have an 18 by 24 inch black canvas and that's painted with a black gesso and then the black gesso is allowed to dry on top of that I've covered the entire canvas with a lizard crimson just a thin even coat and in the corners we've put a little bit of Van Dyck Brown just to darken it and then a couple places here I've added a little bit of phthalo blue just to have some little streaks so I tell you what let's start off and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that that's going up here and get started today I'm going to start with just plain titanium white on the 2 inch brush and just add a little color to the brush by just tapping just a little didn't take much now remember the canvas is already covered with the alizarin crimson and the brown and little touch of blue here and there not much blue and keep the blue toward the top of the canvas okay now immediately today we have to make a big decision normally we don't have to make any but today we have to make a big decision basically or is your horizon going to be because that that will be the lightest area this is going to be a sunset type painting so let's make a decision and decide that right here right along here will be the horizon and then just use a little crisscross strokes and start in this light area and begin working outward just like so but I'm using the brush like so and then little strokes like see just little strokes so it makes little patterns in here okay and we can add a little more white here and there and just begin laying in some little some happy little things here now there it hit a little bit of a blue so you're gonna get sort of a sort of a little lavender feel and that's nice that's very nice there okay this is a fantastic painting to do for friends and don't tell them you've put anything on the canvas and they see starting out with just white paint and you start putting this on and all of these beautiful colors appear and they think you're magic so try that you'll enjoy it there we go we have teachers that travel all over the country and I have them do paintings where where they start out like this people don't know they have anything on the canvas and then they start just adding plain old white and all these beautiful colors appear and immediately they have an audience that just they stay with them for a long time there we go just be the brightest area right in here but in that a fantastic sky already you could leave it just like it if you wanted to and have a winner okay then just use long strokes just sort of bring it all together okay I love these black canvases some of the most exciting effects in this technique happen there let me wash my brush and we wash our brush as you know with odorless thinner get read that excess and beat the devil out of it tell you what let's go right into a little touch of the cadmium yellow just a small amount of paint on the brush just tap a little in there okay let's go right back up here maybe right here I'll add a little yellow there you go you wonder where the yellow it there it is that's where it went and just Sparkle this area here now we don't let this go up too high we have a little bit of blue on the canvas up in here we don't want to let that yellow get up into that blue if it does you're gonna have a bright green sky and then you're going to be upset with me don't want you to be unhappy I'm gonna add a touch of yellow ocher we can just add a little of that here in there we're still using that little sort of life just let it sort of rock back and forth it creates all kinds of happy little things in the sky maybe up in here just to change the color are getting very close to the flu there so be careful mmm did another unbelievable little sky and it's so simple it really is one of the easiest guys to do because all your color is done beforehand but all that crimson on there and it just works for you and that black gesso holds it so well black gesso is designed specifically for this type of painting works good okay now then very lightly go across the entire sky and we can wash your brush one more time get rid of that excess tailoring business again okay now then I'm going to use we use the little fan brush and I'm gonna go into a little touch of blue stay low blue they low blue and a lot of alizarin crimson proportionately much much more crimson than the blue much much more in case we hit yellow we don't want to turn green if you're not sure what color you have there add a little white to yours and put a little over here and add a little white you can tell exactly what you have okay now then let's have just some little floater clouds around here and Jeff sort of still using that same little stroke just let some of these little things just sort of float around let them have fun so wherever you want them to go maybe there's some little incident they come right down into that into that bright spot wherever wherever here's here's a little one over here I see it there it is so you just sort of just sort of make these things up in your mind and let them drop in maybe right in here there's one there's an old big one that just sort of floats around see how you can create the illusion of all kinds of beautiful effects just like so you need these darkman's does make that color stand out just like so there we are that has just they look new and lizard crimson so there is to it now back to our big Brush make sure it's dry you want to you want to dry brush for this if you take a wet brush and go over this the color is going to mix together and you're going to be living in mud city it'll all turn the mud on we don't want that we want to keep these colors vibrant and happy just beautiful be sure your brush is dry can't say that enough you might want to might want to run it against some paper towels or something just to make sure there we go and all we're doing here is still just following those little like we want to call maybe little rocking strokes like so like heaven but didn't had a soup way to make a very very nice guy hmm have to wear your sunglasses when you look at this one but already you have the feeling of a a sunset and all these clouds are rolling through there and you can do it alright yeah then maybe I want to keep this painting quite easy in case this is your first time painting with us this is a good one to do so let's take some black and crimson and something low blue we just mix all these colors together I wipe my knife off I'll be right back okay let's go with our fan brush and load it full of paint a lot of paint load both sides for all right let's go up here they are right here where we decided they decided our horizon would be we're going to begin tapping you some basic little tree shapes look like little trees far away and allow it to pick up some of that color so some of them's lighter in the bag and it looks like a light shining through don't fight this it'll happen automatically sometimes we have a tendency to want to make it darker and darker let some of those remain lighter it really will enhance your painting there we go that's one of those happy accidents let them happen you just let a go right on out like so see and that easy we have the indication of some distant trees that are just living far away there and you can have as many or as few as you want now one thing that I noticed when people first start is they'll put these trees too far apart like this and they end up looking like fence post should that happen all you need to do let's just add some little things in between and it will bring them together and make them look pretty good there and where we want this to go there we go maybe here in there real dark ones might be a little bit closer now the super super way of making the indication of some little tree trunks that live back in here without doing a lot of work show you how to do that that's a lot of fun a lot of fun let me find another fan brush I have several of each brush going here so I don't have to waste all of my time clean I like cleaning the brushes I'm on just pull just just barely tap a little tiny bit of white into the brush just a little bit see none on that side just a little bit now we won't make this look like little trunks that are far away just take it lightly pull up just lightly just lightly pull up very light color shows up so much stronger on these black canvases just slightly here and there there's light coming through and you can see those little trunks that are far away if you have to get one that's too light it's too bright all you have to do is rule just go over two or three times in that dark color that we have underneath we'll just eat it up and it'll go away bein already you have thousands of little tree trunks and you haven't hardly done a thing and that's the joy of painting there hmm that's a pretty little painting already can you wash my fan brush in that we just washing the thinner then wipe it on a paper towel thanks oh man let me find here's an old dirty 2 inch brush we'll just use it now I want to begin creating some little grassy areas back here and create the lay of the Lamb so I'll take this brush it has a little bit of that dark color in it doesn't matter and then we'll go right into some yellow let me reach up here and get some green I'll be right back there we are a little touch of the SAP green but now tap downward with that brush same do it slow seeing see tap let it slide a little bit there okay now then you have to make another big decision here where is our lay of the land how does it how does the land flow in this painting is there a hill here I think there is maybe I'll have a little water you know me I love water so all you got to do is decide where you want you to land to be and just start tapping just tapping like so man reality if you had a sunset this bright chances are this wouldn't be quite this I'm green but it looks better all these beautiful colors and you know when you when you buy your first tube of paint you get an artist license and that license says you can do anything that you want to do on this canvas maybe not anywhere else but on this canvas your artist license gives you complete freedom so we'll do that and all I'm doing here is just tapping there now if you get one that's too bright continue to tap it and once again the color underneath will be picked up and automatically get darker and a little yellow ocher Indian yellow here and there maybe I'll even touch a little bright red just however but begin begin thinking about a lay of the land I know I say that over and over but to me in a painting that's very important it's most important to heavy land flow the way you want it to normally if you have water water is lazy it's like me it lays in a recessed area so you need to Hill or something here to show that there's a recessed carry a reason for the water being down there instead of a pier so and do you not to worry about where you go here we're going to have some reflections in this water so anything that we don't like and I will turn it into reflections why we should do that in the real world but anyway this is our world here so we can live it here okay and we just keep on this little hill I didn't it fantastic look at that look at the way the land flows there and the more you tap this the darker and the softer it'll become but it'll get from very very soft looks like velvet if you try you can make little little grassy areas that oh it's just some place you want to go and run through barefooted teddy you ever had any places like it we wash this brush there goes the studio again okay now then if we're going to have some reflections under here I'll go right into some yellow right into the CAD yellow just tap a little on a brush it doesn't matter how you load it and you have to make another big decision where is your where is your reflections going to live if you want them right here touch and pull straight down just grab it and pull straight down think about how the land with what could be underneath this grass though just pull it straight down what hope you got your sunglasses on the day that's a bright son of a gun beautiful and maybe this water goes let it go right on up here now the more you rub this the darker we'll get because it's picking up the crimson and the other colors underneath all the time just continually picking them up now maybe into here we want that to be the brightest if you want to in your world you could even take a little bit of titanium white and add to it and make it even brighter see now you marry what I was telling you anything you don't like you can turn reflection see if you want to grab that look at there of course now I have to do it all the way across but anything that you want you can change to reflections here okay you want to add a little the titanium white see how that makes it Sparkle be sparingly on now be sparing him not too much don't overkill okay now very lightly very lightly come straight across even though this is going uphill it's a tendency to go this way come straight across it's just enough to wiggle it you can move this rip lit look at that huh it fantastic you can create water that easy now then let's go back I want to take a little dark sienna little van Dyke Brown a little white you just mix that together hey you don't have to worry about over mixing it just like so cut off our little roll of paint that we use all the time like so now then come in here you can begin making big decisions where's our water lines and very lightly just scrubbing you can begin putting up a little Bank I'm sure line just let it work its way right around so all there is to it you can do it Kendu Kinsley anything comes okay Justin see there wherever you want okay yeah maybe over here on the other side we need some we need some things happening over here - we know what this I'll go back this big brush shoot is faster we'll go right into our dark color like so yeah it we just use the corner of this brush let's begin making some big decision maybe the other side is over here and there's little grassy things that live right out like it just close that in turn it into a little little stream or little river lives right down here whatever you want it to be I tell you what let's get crazy add a little more color here I ran out of color oh we got this big old brush going let's just get crazy with it maybe there lives a great big huge tree right let's see maybe that tree comes oh my gosh when I said big tree I mean big tree didn't realize it was going to do that baby that's alright whatever Lexie and I wanted to sort of tilt sort of lead your eye into the painting in nature didn't make all these trees perfectly straight trees grow anyway that makes them happy and that one grew right on off the canvas there okay now maybe I'll tell you when you're painting like this a lot of times you just look at a painting and you begin seeing things you might not have planned them when you begin this painting but they happen and learning to use whatever you see in your mind because very quickly if you do much practicing you'll learn to compose as you go along and maybe there's a little maybe right down here this little Peninsula of land that just sort of floats around just comes out there like so and there's a little touch of high light sparkling across there this is just a little tiny little bit of white but Tiny's a little bit turn a little bit a little bit of dark underneath just sort of set it down into the water see there create a little shadow underneath it then I can put a little tiny waterline into there let that just sort of maybe the water just bounces in please right there's a little slow stream it just has fun just plays and meanders along here there this is a little CAD yellow with white just to sparkle the water here and there q yeah then let's use the knife today we could do this with a fan brush or a knife whatever won't take Van Dyck Brown and just cut off a little roll of paint there it is have it maybe there's a nice tree trunk that goes right up through this big old tree if a tree's crooked chances are chances are so is the trunk we'll have to in the Coe this is so dark you really don't have to put nothing but an outline little brown and height it's the same color I was using for the little land Darius put a few little indications here and there of a trunk maybe a little touch of white right on the edge just where the lights really striking really sparkly and we can come back let's use a one-inch brush today what the heck take a little yellow yellow ochre Indian yellow all the colors I get over here and get some bright red - what - devil okay now then let's put some happy little lambs that live right out here on this tree little leaves oh why Tim son of a guns are sparkling now you've heard me over and over say and I'll repeat it one more time think about form and shape when you're doing this don't just throw these in at random think about all the little shapes see there all the little clumps let him Sparkle let the Sun Shine through here use your artist license oh you forget a little too bright sorry they're pretty so pretty I get there see look at all them sockets and you can put as many or as few as you want in your world just drop them in like that maybe down in here let's highlight some of these old things there we go ooh why that's a beautiful little sparkler there just drop them in I see about putting some of these in front of that dirt area that we built that'll push that right back it's over the hill we can't even see that now maybe in here maybe in here this little land areas just at random wherever you want a few little dirt area shoe and that's just the brown white it'd be used to make all the little colors all the little banks and stuff there there's another little bush now think of individuals here don't just throw these in at random you'll be unhappy with me think of individual little bushes that live here there give each one of a name if necessary I know that's a little crazy but sorry sour world we can do that if we want to tell you what I got a few minutes left here so let's have some fun let's put us a happy little cabin over here shoot this is such a pretty scene need a place to live there's one side there's the other side and you're painting if you don't want a little cabin don't put it down you can put anything in your world that you want I just want to show you how to do some of these things and I just think this would be a super place to have a little cabin sitting enjoy these beautiful sunsets let's use a little red why maybe a little yellow ochre will make that son of a gun right on front Sun striking there and all those beautiful colors are reflecting on that little cabin snow the other side would just use a little brown and white it's not very dark I mean very light it's in the shadow a little bit of Van Dyck Brown making door and we could take a little a little bit of brown on the knife and just cut through put up some little slabs in that cabin they're little ass little side and we'll come right down when I grab a little red dark sienna little touch a white of yellow ocher let's come right down this side here and just let this knife bounce blue blue blue kind of make a little noise see and over here on the other side it'll touch a white with a little red in it just to make it edge stand out a little so you can really see it Thanks so maybe we can take our big brush put some grass around his little foots knife with a little brown add in a little path and I think your paintings about finished let's call this one done I hope you enjoyed this one this will teach you how to make a very simple sunset that'll work for you from all of us here happy painting and god bless
