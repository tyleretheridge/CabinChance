- Hi, glad you could join us today. Today I thought we'd do a
fantastic little painting that I believe you'll enjoy. Let's start out and have
'em run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, lemme show you what I got done up here. Today I have my plain ol' 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched canvas,
and I've just covered it with a very thin coat of liquid white. So it's all slick and it's ready to go. I use an 18 by 24 inch canvas, but at home you use any size
that's convenient for ya. We just use that because it sorta fits the television format. Other than that, use any size. Let's start today with a little
yellow ochre, what the heck. Let's do a painting
today that's very bright, has alotta colors in it,
and just make you feel good. It'll warm up a room if you hang it in it. Small amount a yellow
ochre on a two inch brush. and let's go right up in here. (fast paint strokes) And we just put a little
color in the sky, that easy. That easy, no problem. And it's continually mixing
with the liquid white that's on the canvas, and so automatically it'll get a little lighter in value. There. The more you blend it,
the lighter it'll become. So you hafta make a decision. How light do you want your sky? How dark? How bright? Up to you. When you have this much power, you have to make tremendous decisions. There. Ok, now let's take a little bit. I'll tell you what, let's do. Let's mix up a little lavender color. (scraping) We'll take a little alizarin crimson, a little thalo blue, mix 'em together. Proportionately much, much
more crimson than blue. Proportionately. Blue is much, much stronger. (low airy whistle) It'll just eat up your
whole world in a heartbeat. I'm gonna mix two or
three different values. Over here I've put even more blue. So I've got some here that's
got alotta blue in it, some that's got a little, and that way we can just sorta play around and have several different variations without continually mixing color. There. We'll just use that same ol'
brush, it's workin pretty good. I'm just gonna tap the
corner of the bristles right into a little bit of that color. I don't want a lot of color on there. Just a little, just a little. And let's go up in
here, and let's test it. Ooh, I like it. Ok, we did well. Now using the top corner
of this two inch brush, let's just begin putting in
some basic little shapes. We're not looking for alotta detail. I want this just to be little shrubbery and things that live far away. Way off into the background. Way off into the background. There we are. Ooh, we hit a little
blue there, that's nice. Happy little accident. There. But see, all we're doing is
just looking for basic shapes. When objects are far, far away from you, you don't see detail. You see basic color, and basic shapes. And that's all we're looking for in this. Sometimes we can even do like that, just to blend it. So you just have little
splotches of color. Maybe that's way far away. (grunts) Just let your imagination go. Your imagination can take you to any land that you wanna be in. Any land. All you need to do is
have a vision in your mind and believe in yourself, and off you go. Off you go. Cause I know that you can do anything that you believe you can do. There. And we believe we can
do anything, don't we? Anything that we're willing to
try and willing to practice. Alright, something about (mumbles) Mmmk, little bit more of that color. And I'm just gonna put
layer after layer here. So that it looks like
there's many, many layers of little things that live
back here in the distance. Ok. Now then. Lemme get a clean brush. I've several of these old brushes going, so I don't hafta spend all my
time just cleaning brushes. And here I'm gonna tap to
soften the bottom edge. I wanna soften it til it looks very misty, like it's little layers of
mist floating around in there. Ok. Softer and softer. Didja ever think you could
take a two inch brush and paint such things like this? It looks so delicate. You can, you absolutely can. Let's see, a little
more of the color here. Maybe this comes over. We don't know where it goes. Maybe I'll have a big tree there, so we don't hafta worry about it. I like big trees, as you know. So maybe we'll just
put one right in there. Alright. One of the things that
makes this so great is that we do no sketching, no drawing. You don't hafta be able
to draw to do this. All you hafta do is be able to hold a brush, and off you go. Now then, take a little
little bit of this color that we had here, had a little
more of the crimson in it. A little more crimson. Just tap a little into the bristles. We'll warm it up a little. Yeah, gettin' nice. Let's get more crimson. There, I like the alizarin crimson. It's such a beautiful, beautiful color. Alright, now then, I'm
gonna beat the brush. That just takes off excess
paint, cause I wanna soften this. There we go. K, wherever you want
these little things to be, it's exactly where they should be. Just little layers of color in here. And then very quickly
we'll just blend that away. But see, already it creates
the illusion of distance in your background, and
you've done virtually nothing. You could even take, well let's. Let's do it. Let's take a little blue,
maybe a little touch of yellow into it. That'll make a gorgeous green. Little more to the blue side. And you can adjust this back and forth. And maybe let's get crazy. Try that color. We'll just put a little of that in there just to change the flavor. Just a little cad yellow, thalo blue. But mostly blue. Just enough to give it
a little hit of color. That's all we're looking for. Just a hint. Just a hint. Alright. Shoot, we're makin all kinds
of little background doers. When you're at home
and have unlimited time practice with this, play with it. It's unbelievable what you can make, absolutely unbelievable. Alright. Let's take our little script liner brush and a little bit of paint thinner, just to make a very thin paint. Turn the bristles, that'll bring it to a nice, sharp point. And let's go up in here,
and here and there, and there and here. Let's just put the indication of a few little sticks and twigs
that're livin back in here. We don't want a lot, do not want a lot. Cause they're too far away. You would only see major tree trunks that live this far away. But a few little
indications are very nice. It'll give the illusion of distance and depth in your painting. Alright. something about like that. Ok. Let's have some fun now. Let's mix up. Well, we'll just keep using
that old lavender color we have here. We'll put some black in and some brown, alizarin crimson, a
little bit of thalo blue. (scraping) Like that, it's ok. It doesn't matter. Wipe off the knife. We'll just use one of these old brushes that we were workin with. Put a little bit of that color on there. We need some dark in order to show light. So let's begin designing
our painting maybe? Hey, alrght there, right there. Maybe there's little bitta
land right back in there. This is just dark so that when we put a light color on there it'll show. That's really all we're looking for. Really and truly. We'll worry about other
things as they happen. But in our world, we just
sorta let things happen. Just let 'em happen. Very quickly you learn to work with anything that you create. See because, once again,
we don't make mistakes. Watch it here. If you was to do somethin like this Ok, watch watch. (laughs) This is your BriBri test
already in this painting. You take the corner of the brush. Lookit here. Maybe in our world there
lives a big old tree. We can have a big tree, right there. Right there, that easy. K, now we can take a little yellow ochre, a little indian yellow. maybe
a touch of the bright red. Maybe Jack Frost has stopped by here and we're beginning to see
some gorgeous fall colors, same old, dirty brush. Let's see what we get here. Lookit there. Looka there. That easy. Can just make all kinds of little duders. Put a few highlights on it and already we have the start of a nice little tree. And if you have trouble making your paint stick on top of this,
add a little touch of liquid white or paint thinner. Liquid white will brighten
your color a little. Sometimes you want that,
sometimes you don't. Want your color to stay pure and use just a little paint thinner. Just a little paint thinner, that's all. Ya know, when I say little,
let me emphasize little. It takes very, very small
amount, very small amount. And we're just using the
corner of the brush, like that. See there. Mmk, now then. ♫ Let's take a little sap
green, mix it in here ♫ Sap green and some of our yellows, we'll just make some
beautiful colors here. Let 'em happen on the brush,
don't worry about 'em. Mixing with all of our
yellows, and there's a little touch of red here and there. And we can go right up in here. Ok, look. Watch, watch, watch. Lookit there. We'll just make a nice
little hill right here. Wouldn't that be a
fantastic little place to take your shoes off
and let your naked feet run through there? I like to run through a meadow
or somethin, bare footed. Always feels good. When I was a kid we lived way
out in the woods in Florida, and we used to do it all the time. Shoot, I didn't even wear
shoes until I was about 12. And that's the truth. Even to school we didn't wear shoes. There we are. Ok. See the little hill coming down? That easy! But pay attention to angles. The lay of the land is very,
very important, very important. Lemme grab another brush
with some dark color on it, we can play here. As I say, I have several brushes going. You ready? Let's do it. We have this whole side open over here. I think in our world, add a little bit of dark sienna to that color. ♫ In our world, our world we gotta big ♫ What the heck?! Do it. Do it. There. Steve's always telling me,
don't worry about it dad, just do it! And that's what we'll do. Right there. Just drop in a huge tree. Let it come right in front of this tree. Don't be afraid of it touching. Ya know, in nature, trees just grow however make 'em happy,
so just drop it in. Don't worry about it
touchin the other tree or goin in front of it. In our world we can put trees wherever we want 'em, and we can
move 'em if we want to. We can move 'em. We can do anything in our world. Maybe that comes right on out here. See, already I'm beginning
to see things in here. Practice painting without really knowin exactly what you're gonna
paint when you start. You'll be amazed. You'll be amazed at what you can do. Just have a general idea in your mind of a time of day and a
time of year and go for it. There we are. See there. Tell you what, listen. Let's have some water in here, hmm? This easy, you could, look, look. It looks like the right place to have a little touch of water. Just give it a little downward pull. Just a little downward pull, that easy. Alright. A little more dark color over here. There'll prob be something over here too. I don't know yet. We'll put somethin in, no matter what. Now, very lightly go across. See, and we have instant water. (laughs) That easy. And you can see it shimmer. Water might be one of the easiest things to make in this whole technique. Now as a traditional painter,
water and reflections was very hard to make. I'm just mixin up some more color here. But in this style of painting,
it is very, very easy. Reflections may be one of the
easiest things that we make. I just ran outta paint. I decided I want a tree over
here on the other side too. Right there. (tongue clucking gently) It's our world, so we can put in ya. Maybe he lives right there, I dunno. I don't really know. Doesn't matter. All we're looking for
is just a basic shape. Okay, here it comes, here it comes. Right on out, like, yeah. See? That's all you have to do. Once again, let your imagination take you to all these places, don't worry about it. Alright, I'm going back to the brush that has my light color on it. I'm gonna put a little touch of, oh, scuse me a second,
let me dip right there. Little bit of liquid white. Just mixed a little liquid white in there. It thins the color and also makes it a little bit lighter in value. Alright, let's go right up in here now. And, and, and, and? Maybe. Yeah, look. I want just enough color
variation so that shows. There. Put a little bit of red in
there, now that'll pop it loose. I wanna change the angle
here, change the angle. We have one layer coming down, now the next one's coming back. Maybe, there's a little, might even be a little stream back
here, we can't see it. We don't know, we don't know. Leave some mystery in your painting. Leave a little mystery. There we are. Sometimes it's nice to not
know exactly what happens. There. It's like looking at a beautiful lady. It's much nicer if there's
a little mystery there. Yeah. Alright. Ok, now then. I'm gonna take, just put
a little color on here, I'm gonna make that tree, let's put some fall colors in that tree. We'll take a little red. We can get a little
alizarin crimson too, that, ooh, nice color. Alizarin crimson and yellow ochre make a beautiful fall color. Let's go right up in here. Now I added a little touch
of paint thinner to my brush, so this paint is getting quite thin, and it'll go on there easier. If you have trouble making it stick, add a little paint thinner. Just a little though, takes very little. Very little, doesn't take much. There we are. See there? All kinds of little doers,
they just live in there. Think about shape and form
when you're putting these in. Don't just hit 'em at random. No, not at random. There we go. Alright. And just keep working in layers,
always working in layers. Toward the bottom of the tree let it get darker, and darker, and darker. You want some deep shadows
at the bottom of the tree. That's where all my little friends live. I know if you saw him,
I gotta little Peapod, the cartoon, up here. (laughs) He's on top of my easel. He's watchin me paint today. See? Isn't he cute? (laughs) He even got his own brush. I better watch it, that
rascal be a paintin on here. Mmmk, let's go over
here on the other side. If you've painted with me before you know these little animals
are very special to me. I work with people who take care of 'em all over the country,
and try to support 'em. Most of these people who work
with injured and orphaned animals are doing it
strictly on their own. They get no help from the
government or anybody else. They do it strictly on there own. So for somebody in your
neighborhood, and there probably is if you look around, let's
do it now, go see 'em. You'll be pleasantly surprised at all the little creatures
you can see close up. And not only that, they need your help. They need your help. Sounds like a commercial for 'em, and I'd almost do that. They really are special people. Here in Muncie I work
with a beautiful lady named Diana Schafer, who loans me a lot of the animals
that you see on the show. There. I'm gonna go back to my brush that's got the dark paint on it. And, we have to decide
where this is gonna go. Wherever it's gonna go,
there oughta be a reflection. So just put a little dark, reflect it. Alright. Now that we need a little water line. Let's take some dark
sienna, some Van Dyke brown, some hoyt, mix up together. (clucks softly) Like that. Don't over mix, leave it marbled. Leave it marbled. Let's see, just pull it,
little roll of paint. Let's go up in here and put the indication of a little, maybe a little shore there, little shoreline. There we are. There. Just pull it the same basic angle you have the grass growing. Wherever, wherever. Mmm, we can highlight it with, I'll just use dark sienna
and white for the highlight. No Van Dyke Don't cover up all the first color though, just enough to sparkle
it, to make it stand out. There we are. Alright, back to our brush that has all the pretty colors on it, put a little liquid white with it. Hooo, that's nice. Little more crimson. Alright. Now then, let's begin bringing
down the little grassy areas and decide where they go. ♫ Where they go ♫ You may call those big decisions. Maybe, tell you what. Maybe, maybe, maybe in our world, maybe there's a little bush right here. So for that all we need is
to put a little dark in. You need dark in order to show light. Go into a little paint thinner. Let's get a little sap ♫ green ♫ Make a very thin paint. See that little ridge
of paint right there? It's most important. That's
what we're paintin with. That's what we're paintin with. There we go. Make a little happy bush right there. Shoot, we're in business. But you can put as many or as few little things in here as you want. Maybe over on the other side. We'll have to make some
decisions, that comes right there. I know now. That's where we want it. Go in here with our nice grassy colors, put in all kinds of little duders. There they are. Maybe there's another one right there. It's up to you. You decide how many little bushes and trees live in your world. You put 'em in. There we are. Want this to be a little darker up here so it doesn't show quite so bright. There. There's a little bush. Wherever. There we go. But that easy. Now let's put a little bit of... little bit of land there
to hold all that up. Mmmk. A few little grassy things
runnin down to the land, so it doesn't look too much
like you just cut it off. Take a little liquid
white, just a small amount. Don't want a real bright water line here, just want enough to indicate
that there's a separation. Might even want to add
a little brown to it if you don't want it to get too bright. Cause it really will get very bright. Somethin about like that. Over to here. Right, like that. That's really all we need. Now, let's get crazy. (laughs) You know me. We got a second left here. Let's take, in our world (breathy whistle) maybe (breathy whistle) yep, you guessed it. Big tree and his friend right there. Just use the fan brush,
a little dark color. We can take a little touch of... Little touch of white with a knife. Just touch it. Maybe this is an old birch tree here. We'll just let him go, like so. There. Alright. Now take our script liner, little bit of the dark brown color, and paint thinner. Lot of paint thinner, make it very thin. Then with that, we come right up in here and put the indication of some
tree limbs here and there. We put a few little leaves on
here, so we don't need many. We don't need many, just drop 'em in. Indications. If you have trouble making
the paint flow on here just add a little paint thinner. There we go. Now let's take our little oval brush. (laughs) We got just a second left, we'll have some fun. Take a oval brush, load it
full of color, lotta color. Lotta color. Put a little red in there too. Alright, give it a little push. We'll go up in here. Using that, take advantage
of the little curve that's in that brush. And we can just put all kindsa little leaves up here on these. Thinkin about fall, and off we go. See there? A few on the other side,
right here on this tree. And it's that easy to
make a beautiful little, see this does look like autumn to me. Think we'll call that one finished. And from all of us here,
I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. (70s easy listening music)
