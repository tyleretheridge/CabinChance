come back glad you could join me today they thought we'd do a fantastic little painting and I think you'll really enjoy it it'll make you happy so let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting at home with me and they'll come across as usual in the same order as I have them on the palette starting with the white and working around and let's go lit up here now I've already covered the canvas with a liquid white and it's ready to go so let's take let's take our old two-inch brush and we'll go right into a touch of the phthalo blue and I'm going to reach right over here and grab some alizarin crimson so we have phthalo blue and alizarin crimson proportionately we use much much more crimson than blue the blue is many times stronger now this will look black till you go up to the canvas so let's go up here now up here sort of sort of give it a little test I can see if it's what you want if it's not what you want stop and change it right then don't keep going because it's not going to get any better and use a little crisscross strokes I'm just going to fill in the basic here I think well I think we'll do some big fluffy beautiful clouds today I like clouds I like clouds they're a lot of fun to do yeah sort of let this play around have fun there we go as you work down the canvas your brush is picking up the liquid white and automatically automatically gets lighter in value and in a landscape your sky should get lighter and lighter as it works toward the horizon and while the liquid white that happens automatically you don't have to worry about it you don't have to plan it it happens all right I'm dead of legal while sky they're all ready now I'll have that color on the brush I'm on add a little more and go right back in here and let's put some water in this painting so let's start here and pull from the outside in if we'll have some water in here there we go now you want your water to be darker down here than up here and once again that will help create the illusion of depth in your painting all right hey wake up from this side over we really don't care right now we're just trying to get in some basic basic colors there we go okay I'll wash the brush wash steel brush shake it off give it good wrap and we're ready to go Nathan I want to work on the sky a little bit so start in the light area when you have a clean brush and blend upward you have a dirty brush start at the top and work down bird clean brush you start in the light area and work up with very lightly Cayman down here all the way across that light area where remain if you're very gentle don't don't get too strong take a weak pill there hey yeah yeah then we can play a little bit okay let's use the one-inch brush today and we'll go right into a little bit of titanium white then I'm gonna reach over here pick up some yellow ochre we'll just put it right in here least little touch of the bright red leaves little touch mostly ochre let's go in here now want some color in these clouds today so just sort of figure out where you want the shadows or the dark parts to be and just lay this in now since we have a lavender sky we can put yellows in it if we had a bright blue sky you put this yellow in there chances are you'd get from a brilliant green sky but since it's lavender you mix yellow and lavender together or purple whatever you want to call it and it will make a beautiful brown color we don't care about that that's fine okay it gives us a little color to be in the shadow part of the cloud clean no brush give him a little wrap and off we go and then I'll go right into titanium white same with one inch brush and I'm loading a lot of paint into the bristles huh a lot of paint look at there good let's go up here now then we have to make some big decisions where where does these clouds live then they come watch it watch it tiny little circles keep that brush moving at all times maybe just goes right on off the edge here you don't care let these clouds just float around and off the top there wherever wherever look at that make fluffy son of a guns at play in the sky there and they just float around float around heaven all day would that be a nice lifestyle that's what to do that's what to do no worries no cares just float around wait for the wind to blow them here and there all right keep talking like that now want to be a cloud in my next life there now with a two inch brush using just the top corner of the brush I just want to begin blending this out blending it out barely touching and don't overmix probably one of the biggest mistakes made in clouds is overworking them pretend the clouds are lazy they don't want to be overworked just just enough to to stir them up and mix them up and then leave them alone now we'll fluff them just grab it lifted big circular strokes big circular strokes as we've said before don't grab them and go straight up because it'll look like it's raining up and that'll really disturb you unless you turn the painting upside down turn it upside down then it's gonna be raining down there sometimes when you're painting you might want to put rain off in the distance and that's the way to do it is pull those strokes down like that and it'll create that illusion of rain that's far away there okay let's do let's do some happy little mountains and today maybe I'll do them with a fan brush let's go into alizarin crimson take a little blue just mix them on the brush and I'm going to reach over here and get a little bit of white so we have blue crimson and a little titanium white a lot of paint into the two the old fan brush let's go ahead Pierre maybe there's a little mountain that he lives right back here don't over mix the color on your brush and that way you'll get to all types of little variations happening in your mountain without even trying there there we go now we'll take the large brush grab that very lightly very lightly just pull it out and let it just float right back here in the clouds just sort of floats around see I want this one to be far away so you can just blend right over now you need a firm paint when you're doing this if you use it in paint you're gonna instantly become become a mud mixer then you're gonna yell at me don't want that to happen use the firmest paint you can fine you know same colors same colors but I'm gonna leave the white out I want this to be darker so we have blue and crimson tell you what let's put some midnight black in there too blue Brown I mean blue crimson and a little bit of midnight black tanks go back up here maybe there's a happy mountain oh okay okay he lives yeah he does right there look at there so you just shape these however you want however you want this is your world and you can create any kind of mountain that you want in here maybe he's got a little arm and pokes up right there we don't know don't care hey just let them go this one's a little darker than the one in the back so it helps once again to create that illusion of distance now then with our 2 inch brush we'll grab that color and pull it out just pull it out but these could be nice desert type mountains with all the shapes they have there we go and we let that mountain just sort of just sort of float back there now I have I have several fan brushes going so let me go to another fan brush we'll go in to let's use some tell you what let's use some dark Sienna so Van Dyck Brown like so I will grab some white and put in there there very good okay load a lot of paint into the brush and now begin deciding where you want highlights to be on this mountain now if you live an area that has mountains look around at the colors change the colors of your painting so they match what's in your area if you're doing paintings from that area you know any color will work here all I want to do is show you how to make it work and what colors you use are up to you the fan brush makes a very nice little very nice just very the Browns and the whites all back so you get all kinds of little happy things that are happening in there these fan brushes are unbelievable nice brushes to play with there's a little thing right in there maybe one here let that come right on out wherever you want it to go came down then I'm gonna use a lavender color with a little more blue into it and with that we'll come back up here and we can begin laying the indication of a few highlights here and there just like so see just the principles are the same as if you were making these mountains with your knife and you can't make them with your knife I just want to show you some different type things okay just get a indication of a shadow or two in here like so there we go wherever you think the shadow should be that's where it should be and if you over here I will probably cover those up so I'm not too worried about you know me always got to have a bunch of trees and all that kind of things in there and it may be a little highlight just take some white there we go and maybe here and there just this is sort of a gray color what what was in the brush mixed with white makes a nice gray color and you can put all kinds of different things happening in there but the principles are exactly the same as if you're doing it with a knife a light will strike in the same areas there we go and you can you can slip back pick up a few dark colors if you want to make some very deep shadows in there deep deep shadows about too many just a few just a few okay now clean dry 2 inch brush I want to tap this soften it and create the illusion of mist very soft and then very gently blend that blend it blend it blend it and you can bring it all together be sure your brush stays clean you can just beat the brush rather than going through the whole cleaning procedure that'll take off that excess paint now I just use the same old dirty brush and I'll go into a little bit of SAP green a little bit of brown maybe there's some happy little things that go right up the side of this all of the angles just here and there there's a couple little little happy little happy doers there okay once again good clean dry brush tap it so it creates that illusion mist I will give it a little upward lift now then listen let's play some more we'll take some green some green and we'll go back into that lavender color we use and just mix em all up together here Kings carp in here maybe there's a little footy Hill that lives right in there this is SAP green like there's a little bit of a lizard crimson in there and some of the lavender color we used just all those pretty cars we'll put a little footy Hill in my calf clean brush tap there just to create that illusion of mist lift upward depth - - to see anything that happens in here you can just blend it out it goes away no big deal and then let's start playing I'll take a little bit of yellow some SAP green and just tap them together now if your greens too bright as crazy as it sounds reach over here and take a little bright red and put it because green and red make brown and that'll dull that right right green down if it's too bright for you Cass go up here now maybe back in here we're going to begin having some little little land areas that are happening there we go very salt a little happy metal things back in here and just sort of bury your color so it'll look like little shadows and highlights all playing and just having fun there we go more and more and more take one tell you what get a 1 inch brush now go into some green and some black we'll pull it a lot of pain in the brush okay let's go up here now maybe there's some happy little trees that live back in here just little trees follow the lay of the land this is where you begin creating that illusion and you can put as many or as few of these in as you want see already that's beginning to help create the illusion of depth distance let's go back on this other side over here maybe there's a bigger one it yep you're right you were right he does right there and all we're doing right now it just lay in some dark color so we put our light color on there it'll show up cause as you know you have to have dark in order to have light just like in life I have to have a few dark days so you know when those last days come I'm using SAP green yellow yellow ochre Indian yellow pull it in one direction a lot of paint cans go up here now then we can begin but then some highlights be careful that you don't kill all the dark this starts working so nice it's almost it's almost hard sometime to stop but you gotta stop see leave those dark areas in there that's what so it gives depth to them dimension there we go there we go look at all those little happy bushes they just live right in there suck it all up layer after layer after layer over here there is another one look at that see you can do it the first step in first step and being able to do anything is believe that you can do it because you can do it but you can let you know that believe that you can do it see it in your mind see it finished before you ever start think about what you're gonna do and as I I'm sort of a fanatic but I believe that you can accomplish anything that you want to accomplish but you start out by believing here that it's already happened and you see what its gonna look like when it's done you build a little dream in your mind and you can do that practice it practicing it's like you know athletes when they go to that big event boy if they're gonna think I'll make a big jump they think about that in their mind they see themselves going over that big hurdle over and over and over and then when it comes time it's easy and do the same thing in painting I'm just taking a little bit of the dark color was on this brush and pulling down this will be a little reflection sometime I get on my soapbox and I talk too much I'll hush right over in here there we go pull this straight down straight down straight down very lightly go across just want to create the illusion of water there yeah then clean off my knife let's go right up in here we'll take a little bit of this dark color this is just the Browns let's put a little Bank in here sherlyn I just have a little roll of paint on the knife just allow the knife to barely touch and to graze the canvas to slide over the canvas and leave a little bit of paint it'll look like land areas and all kind of little little happy things going on a little touch of brown and white here and there light color that'll spark lit up let the Sun play through there yeah then let's take an old big brush and we go right through some Van Dyck Brown we'll pick up some black some crimson SAP green whatever go ahead up in here and it will begin touchy pushing bending that brush upward end it upward don't let it slide if the brush slides you're gonna get that yeah you don't want that if you want it to look like hundreds and thousands of little leaves that are playing on through here there we go maybe tell you what let's do let's just let's have some fun we'll just let this come right on out like that right out like it innit fantastic that you can just change your mind and create all kinds of happy things in a heartbeat in one second you can change your mind you can change your painting what started out as a meadow can end up being a lake or vice versa that's the kind of power that you have on canvas see now decided is gonna be another little Peninsula here so we need some shadows pull them straight down straight down go lightly across and that easy we have water let's take our knife we'll put a tree trunk here and now I'll just use some dark sienna maybe there's a happy little tree trunk that lives right in this tree just like it pointed at knife scraping a few little stakes and twig indication let's go on the other side do the same thing just just scrape them in let the cams are shine through there now we go back to her one inch brush I won't dip it into a little of the liquid white try some yellow some SAP green some SAP green okay mica let's make a happy leaf on this tree touch push in the brush a little bit go slightly slightly above the dark you don't want shadows to be on the top use another brush a clean one up I bet to run out of brushes honey a little bit of the liquid hide some yellow and I'm gonna pick up a touch just a touch of the bright red will make a sparkler in here and he lives right there right there look at that mmm that was so pretty it almost hurts why it's a beauty that is a beauty see they're in there you can do it some yellow ocher and some of the greens and I'm just going to begin creating a layer after layer of all kinds of little bushes leaving some dark in between each one if you kill that dark then they're gone just all blend together and we don't want that we want to see individuals up close the foreground is the hardest part of the painting who wears a beauty hmm see we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents and learn to live with those accidents when they happen recognize them recognize them stop right there don't don't keep going don't just kill them they're beautiful beautiful work with them let's go back over here here's a nice tree put some leaves on him there we go working layers create patterns in your tree Jan let's create these patterns so your tree stands out don't just bang bang bang and hit at random that's what your tree will look like there we go if you have trouble making your paint stick and the least little touch of liquid height or paint thinner either one the liquid white will make you color a little brighter which a lot of times is very good but if you don't want that then add a little thinner or you can add a little liquid clear there we go tap some of that write that in there I can't that'll end up being happy little reflections see there's an acid there we go right across okay we'll take some brown and once again we'll create a little bit of dirt right there oops oops oops the light color it's barely touch barely touch pull it across and then some liquid white on my knife pulled out very flat and cut across and let's go right in here we need some happy little water lines here and there look at that that cleans it all up brings it together and easy okay yeah I tell you what let's do tell you what let me find I will use let's use the filbert brush down like it will start with some Brown just load a lot of Brown right into your brace go ahead up here maybe there's a tree it lives yep right there right there now I'm just gonna show you how to make a quick little tree like so and you put as many or as few little limbs on there as you want you take your liquid black and put a whole bunch of nice leave limbs on there there would take some yellow I'm gonna touch of the red and tap it into the brush and just put the indication there's some happy little leaves in there why it's a sparkler and with that I think that gives us a nice completed painting give you a lot of ideas so you can do your own masterpiece send me some pictures let me see what you're doing thank we'll call this painting finished and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless you you
