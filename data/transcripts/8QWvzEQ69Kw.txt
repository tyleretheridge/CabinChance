hey welcome back certainly glad you could join us today because today is a very special day every once in a while when we get him off the road from teaching classes I bring my son Steven here let him give you a demonstration Steve's been painting since he was about 12 years old and I think you'll find he's absolutely fantastic Steve welcome to the show today thanks dad tell you what I'm going to turn it over to Steve and I'll see you later son do it nice painting for everyone okay we're going to start off today by running your colors across the screen we're using just about everything as you can see we've got I think about 13 colors so if you want to go ahead and get those out on your palette if you're going to paint along with me or whatever I'm going to start off the day maybe just with a little bit of pression of blue and we're going to drag that out pound it into that brush real good get tough with it right from the beginning and we'll go up here and starting I'm going to try to make some sort of cloudy shapes up here to start with and maybe on this one side over here I'll add just a touch of crimson to my color alizarin crimson and the pression blue give it sort of a purplish glow over here you know try to use X's and leave a little bit of light area showing through like that now leave your sky with lots of movement in it here because you don't want to you don't want to destroy that that look like the sky is weaving in and out and all that stuff that helps a lot a little more pressing blue and a little more alizarin crimson on your brush and we'll go down here and put some straight horizontal strokes and this will be where our water is at and at the bottom of the canvas these real rough on it you're not going to hurt that canvas okay and then we'll wash that brush out real quick when you're doing a large painting like this it's a really good idea to have a sturdy easel like this one dad invented this easel just for that purpose because it doesn't move all over the floor when you're painting on it there we go just a little bit of blending down here so always start down in the liquid white and work your way up that way your brushed in and get all full of blue immediately okay and then down the water the same thing just use your big brush on the side like this push nice and hard you know if your wrist is wore out by the time you get done doing this you did something right and maybe with a clean brush we'll just go across the center a few times on a nice little light flexion in the water there we go okay maybe we'll do a real quick cloud a little bit of liquid white and some titanium white maybe just a touch of that alizarin crimson in there just a little bit that's a little too much and that cheat with there we go now just drop in a few little cloudy shapes a real light touch and a lot of paint on the brush think about what a cloud looks like real light and fluffy on the top and the bottom of it's basically flat if you want to make a maybe a little straight cloud down here good just like that and there's a possibility that there's one coming in over here too turn your brush on the side spin it a little circle since what clouds are long as you're making little circles you can't go wrong if you're a beginner just starting out for the first time you might want to try this painting because it's real simple real basic it's one of the ones I teach in class most often lift up on those clouds go across them like dad tells you it's just three hairs and some air just a light touch there we go okay maybe we'll put a little mountain back here in the distance we'll start off a little white a little pression blue and a little alizarin crimson white pression blue and alizarin crimson there we go mix that up good and maybe this one will be back off in here in the distance far away just make a kind of a triangular shape and then change it a little bit you know put a little bump here a little bump there [Music] there we go you guys wouldn't believe what I did the other day I went into New York City and help dad work on the Donahue show he went on there and did some paintings and we took five people from the studio audience and taught them how to paint too and then they came out on the stage and unveiled their paintings and they looked almost as good as Bob Ross's if you can believe that it was the first time they'd ever picked up a brush and just goes to show you what you can do with it even Donohue did a painting can you believe that I thought me and Phil Donahue never picked up a brush in his life and he just learned from one of the videos and went on and did a beautiful painting was amazing if you want to take a little bit of titanium white and of course I had some of that crimson leftover in that you don't really want to use pure white on this particular mountain little roll a paint on the knife and just go up there and pull down real gently just lay some snow in there try not to get too much paint on just a little bit always better to have just a tiny bit of paint on the knife as you can see you can get a really nice effect with not a whole lot of effort right here okay and then if we just go in and take a little bit of pression blue and a little bit of white it can be dirty white it didn't have to be clean we can make a nice shadow color a nice light blue there we go and then pull down pull down with those angles like I said a super light touch but you know it's true you don't have to have any previous experience to paint like this I know you're probably saying oh yeah right sure tell me more but no I'm serious the first time I ever did a painting I was happily happy with the results I mean and I got compliments like you wouldn't believe it made me feel real good inside you know so if you feel like giving it a try you're to get one of our certified instructors to teach you a class or something they travel all over the country there we go just a little bit more snow now mountains are they have those little snow caps okay and then let's take a big brush and tap out the bottom of that lift up into it well gently once again if you're real brave you can even do a little bit right there maybe just a touch more snow right here just making decisions as I go I don't have any painting that I'm looking at or anything like that I'm just making it up that's the funnest way to do it there we go maybe there's a nice big foot heel coming under there a little pression blue little black little crimson and a touch of white with that watch how I push this brush up just like that push it into the paint okay then maybe that foot heel goes right across in front of that mountain just like that now remember you using a squared off brush here so turn it to get a nice rounded effect on top of your Hills okay and then maybe we'll lift up a little to give it the distant pine tree look thousands of little pine trees just appearing right before your eyes I've been doing this now since I was 12 years old I'm 27 now and it never ceases to amaze me the results I can get with these huge brushes I mean if somebody you know would come to me and tell me that and I didn't paint it off I tell them they were nuts but since you're watching it happen right before your eyes it proves it like I said anyone can do it you don't have to be a Leonardo da Vinci or a Michelangelo to do this and I'm not going to tell you that this is art that is going to hang in the Smithsonian or anything like that but I will tell you that your friends will probably buy paintings from you after you do a couple so you can actually make money off of it I probably shouldn't mention that but I know some of you might be interested in monetary gain from your paintings I know I am you got to make a living somehow and even if you don't want to make a living from it it's real nice you know when somebody comes up and says I'd love to pay you $100 for that and you're thinking wow am I really that good you know there we go nice distant foothills now this side over here looks kind of barren so maybe we put a couple trees over there how about let's see let's make this a little bit of SAP green you know at the beginning of the show they were running your colors across the screen for you so you should have those all out and ready mix up some greens and brown and some blue so it's really dark so we were to put quite a little bit of white with it I don't work maybe a little more green here right now and we'll go through that with the fan brush pull through like this real long and flat strokes okay maybe there's one right here we'll push up push up on that brush go back and forth like a Z pushing pushing up okay maybe a taller one right here I'm going to have a tall buddy right beside him that's who gives them advice on those really cold days there we go you'll catch me making sound effects here and there that's really good you know if sometimes if you make a little sound effect to go along with something it helps you remember that then you can just go you know doot doot doot or whatever and pops right out to you that are easier to remember things that way then down in here I'm just going to draw a line so I know where I'm going to I'm going to have my land coming around like that and then rather than wasting time with the fan brush why not fill it in with a larger brush when I say large I mean it don't 2-inch right in there just like a foothill if you want to make it look more like grass just turn the brush over and push up on it look at that smashing it right there right there into the canvas okay gee whiz that'll wear your arm out okay a little bit more on there and maybe we'll reflect this down say you accidentally made this piece of land too wide well just go up in there a little bit higher when you're pulling but keep that curve down to the left on it because that's what makes it look like it's further away here than it is over here that's the effect we're trying to get and remember when you're pulling a reflection down pull it down as low as the things above it are high so if this tree is this high that reflection would have to go all the way to the bottom okay and why don't we just take a clean dry brush and go across that real quick and let's use that same one and go through a little bit of cadmium yellow CAD yellow or to work good a little bit of thinner maybe a net not one drop of thinner it's all it takes and we know yellow and blue make green so just push up into that yellow and blue combination and come in here maybe it will highlight a little bit leave some of that green grass sticking up and back this is a nice bright color I really like it look at that you can make one come in front of another whatever you want to do people come up to me while I'm doing demonstrations and they say where are those numbers at where you got those numbers hidden I say what numbers are you talking about I said in this paint-by-number no way no way we don't even draw a picture on the canvas before we start not even a guideline you know once in a while when I'm doing a black gesso type thing I'll do that but on white canvas I usually just wing it people are impressed by that and you know after you take a painting class and you come back home and people see your painting they say oh my goodness I never knew they had it in them they really think you're talented suddenly you know and you are but I'll tell you what's so fun about that is there's a prestige that goes along with being an artist and I'll tell you what the first painting you do and you bring it home and it looks nice like that they'll say that you know this person is an artist Gladys is definitely an artist suddenly people change the way they think of you too for the good and that makes you feel good inside always go across that reflection with a clean dry brush you have to make it look like water down there okay and maybe a little little land into that little bit of Van Dyck Brown touch right here and then just pull down that's simple with the greatest of ease you have shale looks even better after you put a little bit of highlight on it just dark sienna and white for that real simple color mix this gives it that clay look clay and rock there we go just like that now maybe with a one inch brush in that same yellow color we'll drop in a little grass on top of that remember whenever you're putting thin paint on top of thick paint you want to put quite a bit on the brush like this maybe a little blue with that and use a real light touch why that turned that into a super color see I just guessed and it came out like that now you probably don't believe that but that's really how I do it I just if I see two colors that look like they'd make a nice color I just put them together people ask me all the time Steve how do you know what colors to mix how do you know how to do it well I just played with it I just played with the brushes and the paints and everything all of it you know and suddenly things just start to happen for you like I remember that fan brush I I had the hardest time learning how to paint with that fan brush then after I made like a hundred pine trees on cardboard I could make one just as good as anybody else could have been doing it a long time you know there we go how about some highlights highlights on the pine trees a little bit of the blue and the yellow together mix it up on the brush and we'll come in and just smash a little bit of that in on the right-hand side of those trees if you get a little bit too much highlight here there just go back with a little bit of the dark paint and cover it up and if you really don't like something you can just scrape it off and start over and don't think of it as oh my gosh I had to scrape something off my canvas and start over don't think of it like that that's depressing think of it like I just got two canvases worth of practice for the price of one here we go they're sitting right down in that grass and let's see maybe a little shoreline underneath this with liquid white spend that liquid wine around like that go through it and straight across straight across still water lies flat so don't let that water line get all bent up and stuff this is the exact --it and maybe a couple of water lines out here let's go ahead and go through our dark green color and add a little bit more blue and green to it make it super dark and then maybe right here we'll just have a little tree that's getting bigger all the time oh no it's huge look at that it's a monster you can tell I knew that I was going to do that didn't you look at that huge go do it you know what we're going to do we're going to put another tree in front of this and this will be like a background type thing so I'm just doing it real quick not spending a lot of time on the highlighting of it either because like I said it'll be a nice birch tree right over in front of there well heck it didn't look too bad like it is you know I got to keep it confident so I'll tell yourself you're good even if I'm not happy with the way my painting is going I always try to keep in good spirits about it you know because it's just a painting it's not it's not that big of a deal okay for that birch tree it's a Van Dyck Brown out there get a roll on your knife and then nice big one there we go all the way down to the bottom maybe you don't have to trunks on it like I said always always give it a friend come in from the other side fatten them up a little bit feed them some more lasagna and then a little bit of titanium white for highlight on those smash that titanium white out like that and then just pull in pull in don't want to cover the whole trunk with white you want to leave half of it brown maybe underneath there you know that same old green color you were using before add a little bit more blue and brown and green to that make it even darker just make it a little bit darker it's the same color you can call that the base color just smash right over the bottom of that tree and put some bushes in there you can do that part with a paint roller and get away with it pull through your CAD yellow like this and maybe a little bit of highlight on a couple of these bushes just turn that brush just like you're going around a clock see here twelve o'clock one o'clock two three change your color put a little red in there a little yellow ochre or Indian yellow it's up to you well just became a fall seen that quick didn't it that's what's nice you're not committed or anything with this and do anything you want it's always going to look nice because you did it and you're wonderful you have to believe that I heard somebody say one time never never try anything just do it that's probably the best saying I've ever heard little grass with the brush sideways like that and maybe to finish her up we'll have a couple branches that's just Van Dyck Brown and paint thinner together you need quite a bit of thinner in that you want it Indian ink consistency if possible extend the top to your trees and do a few little trunks coming out keep on putting that thinner in there you're going to need a lot when you make a branch come out make it kind of like a guy with his arms sticking out you know go out and then up a little wise and little v's and try to stay away from that pitchfork look okay now she's getting pretty close now look at a couple more branches and maybe a quick signature down here there we go and we're all done thanks for watching me today I hope you enjoyed it and if you're a beginner try this painting it's really a nice one to start off with good luck [Music] you [Music]
