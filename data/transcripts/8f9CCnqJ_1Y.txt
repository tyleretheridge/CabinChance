- Welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today, maybe we'd just do a fantastic little winter scene. So, let's start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need, to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I
got going up here today. I have my standard, old
18 by 24 inch canvas, but you use whatever size is convenient. Today, I've put a piece
of contact paper on here and just cut a little oval out of it. I thought we'd just do
a little winter scene and see what happens. We've covered the inside
of this with liquid white and it's all wet and ready to go, so, let's just have a good time. Sometimes when you're doing winter scenes they can get so cold,
they're almost distasteful. I mean, you have to put on
a coat just to look at them. I thought today, we'd
do one that's very warm and very pleasant. It makes you feel good. So, let's start out and use
some warm colors in this. I'm gonna start with a little
bit of the Indian yellow. Just a little on the two-inch brush, don't need much, just a little. Okay, let's go right up in here. Maybe we'll have a little
bright spot in our world. There it is, right about there. Wherever you want it. Something like so. There. And, we just sorta let it
go out, about like that. While I have that color on the brush, maybe we'll have a little water. Let's just pull that
straight down right there, or straight up, whichever. It doesn't matter. Now then, we'll take a little cad yellow, and a little bit of the bright red, and just mix them together. And you could mix these on the brush, or you could pre-mix them, either way. I'll just do it on the brush. It really doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. I wanna make a nice orange-y color here, about like that. All right, now then, with that we'll just lay in a little of that right around that first color of yellow that we laid in. There. Look at there, if you put two
eyes and a big smile in there you'd have Lil' Orphan Annie. All right, a little bit
more of the red there, and we'll just put that right in. Now, while we have that
orange-y color going, I'm gonna add just a little of that right around the yellow that's down here. This is gonna be water eventually, so we're just putting some color here. Something like so. Now then, let me grab my other brush. I have several of each going here. Let's take a little touch
of the Prussian blue. You need very little. It's so strong. A little Prussian blue, a little black, and just mix them together on the brush. Blue and black, or black
and blue, whichever. Okay, then, right up here, I'm gonna add just a little bit of that. Now we don't wanna have to get into that yellowish color, because as you know, probably, it will turn green on us, and we're not looking for green in that. All right, let's wash an old brush. That's the most fun part
of the whole technique is just washing the brushes. Shake off the excess, and just beat the devil out of it. Now, very lightly, let's
begin blending this out. Start in the light area, and work outward, always working outward. You don't wanna take the dark color back into the center. There we go. Just blend it on out. There, okay. Now then, to really sparkle that watch here, watch here. Let me wash the brush one more time. I wanna start with a nice, clean brush and it's a way of getting
even with my camera crew for picking on me, too. I'm gonna take a little
bit of the titanium white on the two-inch brush. Just plain titanium white. Just load a little on there. Let's just go in here and dance in a little bit of this white color. Just sort of dance it in,
and I'm gonna let it swirl and have fun, and wherever it wants to go. But, start in the lightest
area, and work outward, want it to get darker as it goes away from this light area. There. Then, very lightly, we
can blend that together. Okay. You can do that several times to make it as bright as you want it. It's up to you. You have to make that decision, how bright you want it. You can make it very bright, or leave it quite dark, doesn't matter, depends on the mood that
you're trying to convey in your painting. Now then, while we've
got that white on there, right below here, I'm
gonna put a little white right into what's gonna be the water. Just like that, and then very gently we can begin going across. The color will remain in there but that sort of blends it all together. Okay, good. And, one more time, we wash the old brush. Let's just wash it. Shake it off, and we're in business again. Now then, I tell you what, let's use the... We use a one-inch brush today. I wanna take white, be right back, don't go away, grab some of the bright red. I wanna make a nice pink, nice pink color. That's pretty. Now then, with that loaded
on the one-inch brush, let's go up in here. We need something to bring
these two colors together because, once again, we can't mix them or we'll end up with green. So, we'll let this pink be a little cloud that lives right here. It'll be our barrier. It's our protector. It keeps our color nice,
and pure, and clean in between these two. We'll just sort of let it blend down. You can have happy, little clouds that just float all around,
wherever you want them, wherever you want them. You know, maybe there's
even some over in here. I don't know, wherever you want them. Okay, and then back to our two-inch brush. Then, very gently, we'll
blend the base of the cloud with just the top corner of the brush, the top corner of the brush. There. (brush beating against easel) I beat it just to knock
off the excess paint, and then, very gently,
we can fluff that up and bring it all together. That gives us a nice little barrier between these two colors. You just blend that until you can't tell where one color stops and
the next color starts. Isn't that a very nice, little sky? It's so easy to do, so very, very easy to do. All right. Okay, we'll wash the old one-inch brush, and have it all clean and ready. Actually, I just like to wash brushes. There. That's not as much fun
as a two-inch brush. Now, tell you what, let's use one of our round brushes. Why don't we take some black, little dark sienna, tiny
little bit of Prussian blue? I don't want much Prussian blue in there, maybe even a little Van Dyke, a little touch of crimson. So, we have black, dark sienna, Van Dyke, little crimson, blue,
all of our dark colors. Now then, maybe in our world, there live some nice trees right in here. And this round brush, I
have the big round brush, and all you have to do
is just tap, just tap. We'll put in some very basic shapes. Now, I normally start at the bottom and work upward, because that way the darkest part of your
bushes, and trees, and stuff is down here in the deep shadow. As you work upward, automatically it's gonna get lighter,
and lighter in value. That's what we're looking for, because underneath here,
there'd be all kind of shadows that would hide everything, the little, sneaky things that live way down in there. As you run out of paint, you
can put some very light ones, I'm barely touching here, that'll end up looking
like they're far away. But very light, just barely can see them. There, and darker ones in front of it. See how that makes another plane there? There we go. Something about like that. Whatever, totally up to you. You make the decision. And, we take our script liner brush, use a little bit of black, or brown, whatever you want. I'm going to use black today, I think. Make that paint thin like ink. Let's go up in here, and
put us in an indication, here and there, of a few little trunks, and sticks, and twigs, and
all these little things that make up the tree, the
little skeleton of the tree. Got to have some bones in him, don't want him to just fall over. There, and there. Sometimes, you can just take the knife, and just scrape through and allow some of the canvas to show. It looks like little,
white sticks and twigs. You have a lot of those in the woods too. They're not all dark. They're every shade there is, dark, light, and everything in-between. That's the easy way to do that. Now then, in the last show, I introduced you to a new brush, this little, half-sized, round brush. Let's take it. I'm gonna use a little bit of the yellow. Yellow here, and let's get a little red. Let's make a nice orange-y color. This is gonna be a bright painting, gorgeous winter scene. There. I like winter scenes. I grew up in Florida, and
was about 20-years old before I ever saw snow. I joined the military, and I think our dear uncle found out, Uncle Sam, found out that I had never seen snow, and so he sent me to
Anchorage, Alaska in January. That's how I got introduced to snow. Before that, I thought ice was something that just grew in the refrigerator. I didn't know it actually
grew on the ground. I had quite an indoctrination. Little more of the red. Now, you can use any color you want. I just want to make something that's very bright and cheerful today. It's a fantastic day here, and it's nice to do scenes
that reflect the way you feel. There. But, work in layers. Those layers will create the depth in your trees and bushes. There we go, a little more. I'm just loading a little color on here. Something about like that, that's probably about
all we need right there. Now, watch. Let me find another brush. That one looks clean. Let's take just plain titanium white, load some color right
on that two-inch brush. There we are. I've loaded it pretty sharp. It's almost a chisel edge, pretty sharp. Let's go up in here, have
to make a major decision, where does your snow live in this world? I think, yup, you're right. There it is. It lives right there. All you have to do is just pull. Just pull it. Allow it to pick up a
little bit of that color, so it looks like shadows in there. A lot of times we avoid
picking up that color, and that little bit of
color that it picks up is really what makes it so pretty. There we go. The more you blend it,
the smoother it'll become. You can blend this until
it looks like silk. It's just really up to you. Sometimes you want snow
that looks quite rough. Sometimes you want snow that looks like just smooth as it can be, smooth as silk. I'm gonna add a little
more color here and there, back on this, this is the
little half-sized brush again. Yup, there's a little bush
that lives right there. But see, you put a layer of snow in, then put a bush, and let me grab... Just stay right there. Now you grab the bottom
of this and pull it out, and this is the way you create
the illusion of distance. Now, look at the layers. That's what makes all that work. Now we can put a... maybe there's even a little one over here. Who knows? We don't want that side left out. But, you can just close that
right in, just that easy. There. Okay, now, we have what looks
like a big tree up here. Let's work on it. Take our dark sienna, black, a little tiny bit of blue, not much blue. Because we're using yellow there, we don't want much blue, or
everything will turn green. We have a shape here, let's just bring it right on down. See how you can pull this
tree right to the foreground? All you have to do is
decide where it lives and you can move it
anywhere that you want it. It lives right there now, because we said it does. This is our world, and
we can do anything here. Now, our liner brush,
little touch of the black. We'll give him a little arm
in there, a little trunk, there, and just a few limbs. We're gonna put some leaves on there. You're probably not
gonna see most of them, but we know they're in there. Even if they all get covered up, we know they're in there. Just to give him a little center. Let's see, let's use a little cad yellow. Let's have a nice, bright
color on this tree. Let me grab a little touch of that, a little bright red, maybe even a little alizirin
crimson in that one. I like it, I like it. Now, push the brush so it
gets a little ridge of paint right out on the edge. Let's go up in here, start
right above your shadow color. Then, let's begin just
laying in the indication of all kinds of little highlights there. There. Winter scenes don't always just have to be blue, and white, and cold colors. You could make winter scenes that are very warm, and very pleasant. If you're interested in selling paintings, and, of course, none of
us are interested in that, but if you're out making a
happy buck with your paintings these are the ones that will sell. They go very nicely with about any decor and they really brighten up a room. People like these. They really brighten it up. There we go. Don't kill all that dark. Maybe right in there,
there's some little doers. Just vary your colors back and forth, whatever you think. We let that just disappear
right back into there. It'll be darker underneath that tree. There'll be a big shadow under that tree. Now, back to our brush that has the titanium white on it. Once again, allow it to pick
up a little bit of that color and it becomes your shadow. Pull it. There. That's all there is to it. We can take a fan brush with some of those same colors on it, and just push it upward. Here and there, we'll
make a little grassy area that comes out of there. It cleans up the edges,
and brings it all together, just like that, and smooth it out. Now, let's get crazy. What the heck. Black, dark sienna, a little
Van Dyke, little crimson. There's already a little blue in there, so that's all we need. Load some color back into
this old, big, round brush. Let's make a decision. In our world, there lives
a big tree, and it goes... Where does it go? Where does it go? Just let it go. What the heck. Sometimes these things get away from you. Maybe, okay, all right, maybe it goes all the way to the top. What the heck. We can do that if we want to. This big, old tree lives right up here, and, maybe, right down in front of here. But, see, each one of these will make a different
plane in your painting, a different layer. That really helps create that illusion of depth and distance. I know I say that over, and over, but it's so important. Now, back to our liner brush. We'll pick up a little bit of that black. And, with that, let's
put a trunk in this tree. We don't want it left out. If you have trouble making the paint flow, all you need to do is add a little bit more
of the paint thinner. Just little limbs, and sticks, and twigs that are growing back in here, maybe you can't see the entire thing, but they're there. We know they're there. See, there's one there. There we go. One that comes right
off the contact paper. Any adhesive-backed
paper will work for this. You can create any shape that you want. It doesn't have to be ovals, or squares. You know, just let your imagination go, and make any old shape. One of the best ways I've found to find different shapes, placemats have a variety
of beautiful shapes that you can lay right on
your adhesive-backed paper and make beautiful, beautiful shapes. I'm just loading this
half-sized brush back up again, and we'll go back up in here. There we go, there. See, you can give it a
little push sometimes and just make them limbs look like they're hanging over. Just depends on the effect
you're trying to get. Sometimes I hit straight, sometimes I give it a little (grunts). If you don't make that
noise, it won't work. There we go. Just a little something. There we go. Think about some basic
shapes and patterns in here. Don't just throw them on at random. Don't just throw on at random. There we go, there's another one. We'll add a little more color. That's nice. Each one of these would be a
different limb on your tree, different little projection. Just, jumps right out at you. Once in a while, you can add the least little touch of
titanium white to your color, just to sparkle someplace where you think the sunlight would really strike, but don't overdo it, or
it'll lose its effectiveness. Will totally lose its
effectiveness, if you do too much. There, a little bush there. Maybe, there's one. All kinds of little
doers that live in there. Wherever, wherever. Now, some of these I wanna leave almost black, almost dark, because it'll really enhance it. Now, back to our white. Let's just pull across. See how it's picking up
that color, once again. Don't fight that when it happens. Don't fight it. Let it work for you. There. Now then, anything that you don't like, you grab the bottom of it, and just pull it down. It just becomes part of the
reflection in the water. You don't ever have to
worry much about this because all you do, is just pull it down. I added a little bit more of
the same color on the brush so we'd have a little more
of a reflection, like that. Now, I'll show you a little trick. We put that on with a brush, now take the knife, barely touching, and just let it bounce and graze, but don't cover up all that,
that you did with a brush. It makes just a wonderful,
and beautiful effect. People will go crazy trying to figure out how you done it, and don't you tell them. That's our secret. That's our secret. There we go. There, see, there's another
little doer right there. Take a little bit of the liquid white, come right back in here, and now we can just cut in a little water line, or a little snow
that's laying right along here. Something like that, just something to cover up the bottom. It brings it all together,
smooths everything out. There. Okay, maybe in our world, maybe, yup, let's do this. Let's have that come right across here. Something like that. There. Now, back to our knife, barely touching. Let me get a little more paint on there. Just sort of let that
just float across there, allowing that paint to break, once again, allow that paint to break. That's what makes it look good. Now, tell you what let's do. Shoot, we're having so much fun, let's really get crazy. Maybe over here, there's another one. Just put in a very basic
little shape to start with, with a little shadow color in it. Something like so, little shadow
underneath, pull it across. Then, back to our titanium white. Now, very lightly once again,
just sort of let that float right along on there. Just let it float. Back to our liquid white, and we can put a little water line in there, like so. There. Let's go back to our old fan brush that has the colors on it, and we can put in little grassy areas, and little things all
over wherever we decide they should live. I think there should be one right there. It comes right out. There we go. And maybe, yup, you're right, there's another one right there. This helps form all these little shapes. Maybe over on this side there's... Yeah. There he is, comes right along in there. Something like that. We can take our knife, pop in all kinds of little sticks, and
twigs, and little things that live down here. All you're doing is just
scraping through the paint and allowing a little bit of
the canvas to show through. We go back to our liner brush. I'm gonna use a little
bit of the black still. Want this paint to be thin as ink, so it flows very nicely. Here and there, and there and here, we'll put a stick, and a twig, all these little things that are just living out here and having fun. There. It's these little details that'll make your paintings special. Don't be afraid to add these. Enjoy them. There. Maybe there's even... Yup, you're right. One or two out here, and one about here. Something like that. Sometimes it's fun. Tell you what, let's take a
little of the yellow color, maybe a little white on it. I'm gonna dip in here and get the least little touch
of liquid white to thin it because we're getting quite a
few layers of paint on there. I have liquid white, a
little yellow, and white. Something like so. Just quite a bit of paint. Maybe we'll put just a few little... Look it there. Just push upward. Make a few little doers
that live right out there on that little stick, look
like a little, happy bush. I think now is the moment of truth. Tell you what, we'll bring
the camera right up here. Let's take the contact paper
off and see what we have. This is fun time. Isn't that something? This contact paper is
one of the neatest things that we've ever come up with. I think everybody likes that. It really works well. As I mentioned earlier, we're not interested in selling paintings, but if you should be
out selling paintings, this is one that will really sell, these ones with the ovals
and the different shapes and stuff like that. I think this one's about done, so I'm gonna take a little paint thinner, and a little bit of red, and let's sign this one. We'll sign him right down here. I really hope you've
enjoyed this little painting because it's an easy one that you can do. We're gonna call that one finished. I enjoyed being with you today and from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (gentle guitar music)
