Oh welcome back certainly glad you could join me a day because today is fun day today we're going to have a super time let me tell you what I've done up here already I've let MO 18 by 24 canvas but today I've cut contact paper and made a beautiful design on it and then we're going to paint a happy little painting on that take the paper off and I think you're just going to be overjoyed at what happens so let's start out and have them graphically around all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this project with me and while they're doing that shoot let's go on up here and get started ready all right what take Oh 2 inch brush and let's let's put some beautiful colors in the scattered em I'll start with a little touch of Indian yellow just a little touch of Indian yellow and we're going to go right into about this area use a little crisscross see strokes there with exes and I sort of let it wander right on off the canvas like at what the heck what the heck then we'll come right down here and do the same thing just bike it okay now without washing the brush same old dirty brush I'm going to go into a touch of yellow ochre just a touch don't get too crazy just tap it a little bit and then for the yellow ochre sorry just go around like so just here in there same thing down here what are we doing the sky today we're going to do down here this is going to be reflected into the water same will dirty brush alizarin crimson same old dirty brush just tap a little of that right into the bristles just a little just a little okay now then let's just take the crimson and just let it dance up wherever you want to take maybe up through there add a little more color maybe it plays over into this do you just make the decision but whatever you do up there bring it down here just like so and still without cleaning the brush alizarin crimson and the least little touch of the phthalo blue so we have blue where to go and crimson there you go and you can just mix these red on the brush son of a gun gets away from me sometimes had to hunt it down here we're here now see that's a nice lavender color but it's just brush mixed alright let's go ahead up here a bit wail and just take and put in some lavenders here see fill up all these little holes with lavender Purdy and lavender you can get away with putting lavender against the yellow there's a little place we'll head so maybe even wherever and we'll come down here in the water and we'll do the same thing the lavender and let it work up here and a little touch in here choose wherever you want it just just let it play around have fun okay and after all of that we've got the whole canvas covered and we hadn't had to wash the price one time and I'm lazy I like I like paintings where I don't have to wash the brush you don't have to work hard I try to design paintings that way so now I'll wash the old brush give it a shake beat the devil out of it now then let's go right up here and just do like so here I'm just going to blend all these colors together but start in the lightest area and work outward you don't want to blame the dark color inward blend the light color outward hope all that makes sense sometimes I have a hard time explaining what I'm thinking times I have a hard time figuring out but I'm thanking there we go just bring it all together till it's nice and smooth every once in a while rap the devil of your brush you know this is so much fun I get letters from people all over the country they say they don't want a paint they have no desire to paint they just buy a brush and beat it so if that if that makes you feel good just take your brush and beat the devil out of it it beats arguing with a wife or kicking around a dog have fun and find there we go see look how soft and gentle that is becoming there and you can blend this as much as you want there we go just like so I'll be to the you now down here I'm just going to go across because this is going to end up being water and water is flat so we just go across and bring all this together the color will still remain there but it'll just look different in this guy that easy now we can stop right here and we have a painting for the Museum of Modern Art or that's I would fit right in there okay let's put a happy little cloud up in here just use the one inch brush today and we'll pull it right through titanium white just pull it through and load it full of paint pull the paint okay let's go up here maybe there's a happy little cloud that lives right up here in the corner and he just floats around and comes right on out there wherever you want him this is your cloud so you put him where you want him in your world and he has a friend and the friend lives right over here this is just straight titanium white now it's gonna pick up all all of these beautiful colors that you already have on the canvas there we go say they're tiny little circles tiny little circles there clean dry brush and very gently very gently just blend that with pollen there there's a happy little cloud let's put one right down here these are the kind of colors that that my mother would like so I tell you what I'm gonna dedicate this painting to my mother she lives in Florida and I hope she enjoys this she's super ly she's my favorite lady in the whole world there we go lift this up like so another happy little cloud that easy see little clouds can be fun they're easy to make and you just throw them in and go about your business now let's put them out in here take some blue a little bit of blue alizarin crimson I'm looking for sort of a sort of a purplish color so crimson add a little black in there too so lizard crimson phthalo blue a little black that's hard to tell what color that is if you put a little over here grab a little white and rub in there so then you can check it out that's not as purple as I want it I have it's more crimson you can change your mind now that looks a little better okay let's do that now you have to make a big decision where does your mountain live in your painting I think it lives right there way certainly does now the only thing you're worried about when you put this mountain in is a nice outside edge up here you could care less what's happening inside of the top get really careless use a lot of pressure push that paint right into the fabric see there and mountains are one of my favorite things to paint I lived in Alaska for a dozen years and you can't live in Alaska and not fall in love with the mountains they're spectacular now they would take a 2 inch brush and we want to grab this and pull it because this is wet you can move the paint if this was a drier canvas at this point you would be an agony city you'd be yelling at me this is a wet on wet painting technique the paint's are extremely firm extremely thick so you can do this you can move the paint and you want to blend it so the bottom of it just disappears just absolutely floats in the mist okay I'm going to take white I'm going to add the least little touch least little touch of bright red to it be very very limited with this bright red so strong get a small roll of paint on the knife okay go right up here now if the lights coming from the right that we want to highlight the right side of the mountain touch no pressure just follow right down the mountain no pressure though no pressure no pressure can't see that enough times that's probably still the most common question I get asked when people write is how can I make that paint break on the mountains by breaking we leave all these holes that it's one of two things if you're having this problem number one the paint you're using is not firm enough you're using a thin paint Ollie paint won't work you have to have a very dry firm P secondly you're too strong you're adding too much pressure to the knife take a weak bill maybe maybe there's a little light and singing through here and it hits right over there wherever it is your mountain so you have to make these big decisions put some shadows for that would take quite a little bit of play a little blue mix it together like so it's a nice blue pretty blue cut off that little paint again always that little roll of paint there we go and then go in the opposite direction another question that I get repeatedly is that people say I went out and bought a knife and it don't look like yours the blade schastye the blade of my knife look like korone because of all the lights here in the studio we paint the knife black but it is no different than the one you have no different so very shiny but if I left it shiny like it director would be out here yelling and screaming that because it would cause great big flares big light shiny things so we painted black the brushes even the brush handle some time of the furrows the metal part looks different because we put tape over just once again so the studio lights don't make them shine I keep talking keep building mountains we're going to be all the way to the bottom of the canvas so I'll hush I'll stop here we'll do something else okay now we want to create the illusion of mist at the base of this mountain take a clean dry brush and tap tap very gently following the angles in the mountain always following the angles you don't want to come straight across or you'll just chop that mountain off I'll always follow those angles and softly softly the higher you go the softer up here you just barely touch it very touch down here you can get a little stronger on this side of the mountain follow these angles okay knock off the excess paint and very lightly lift upward see how it makes that beautiful beautiful soft misty area down at the base of the mountain and if you can see the entire Mountain it's always more distinct at the top than it is at the bottom the cause of mist and pollution and all these things they diffuse and break up a light alright and that quick we got a happy little mountain this has some fun back and grab a fan brush let's mix up we just use the mountain color we'll add some Brown to it and least little touch of SAP green least little touch so we get some dark Sienna some Van Dyck Brown blue crimson she would throw some black it to anything you got just throw it in there okay let me clean off my knife take our fan brush loaded full of paint a lot of paint just to really fill it up really fill it up okay both sides let's go up here and then back in here I want a happy little tree and I think he lives right there take the corner of the brush and just begin building your little tree didn't it super these little trees live right in these fan brushes like that maybe yep right there there's one that's a little bigger you have to make a decision though how many trees live in your world maybe you'll have a little bit of land that comes right out through there wherever wherever wherever it will reflect some of that right down into the water just just generally we're not looking for exact shapes just generally that's a little tree you saw him here didn't ya yeah I knew there there we go just all kinds they have the little trees and then let's have some fun reach up here with your big brush grab just the bottom of this just the bottom see pull straight down it's important that you go straighten down beat your brush come across and instant reflections now we can take some liquid light and to that I'm going to add the smallest smallest amount of the bright-red cut across it and go right up here and I'm literally pushing very firmly gonna cut in a happy little water line just cut it in and while I have that old knife here we'll scratch an indication of a few little tree trunks here and there wherever you want in that some that easy you can make a fantastic little tree same color now as we move forward in the painting I'll tell you what let's do let's have a big tree and he goes we appear well this is gonna be a big tree now you could do this one the two-inch brush would be faster but since I've already got this brush dirty with issues it whatever I left that do you just cut them down using more and more pressure on the brush as you work down down down Sena my god I didn't realize that tree was gonna be that big when we have to do another canvas on the bottom and get all him that's all right let's give him a friend do you know me I think everybody or to have a friend hey everybody her to have a friend you know I travel all over the country doing demonstrations for PBS stations and another charity groups and I meet so many fantastic people I have made hundreds and hundreds of friends all over the country and if I get to your town I hope I get the opportunity to see you and to meet you talk with you look at the paintings that you're doing it's almost unreal some of the paintings that people are bringing me that they're doing and I'd like to see yours taking a little dark sea on a little Van Dyke Brown and let's go in here and pop in a happy little Bush or two like so maybe right about there like so and one of the things we maintain a little mailing list if you would like to know who we're going to be in your area just drop me a line you can just send it to the address at the end of the show drop me a line give me your address and we'll send you a card we're going to be in your area you come out and see us or contact your PBS station ask when they're going to have us there okay just all kinds of happy little bushes now I want to reflect some of these into the water so I just reverse the brush and drop them right into the water that easy that easy you can do right there hand it clean dry two inch brush touch pull straight death straight down straight down see they're beautiful reflections beautiful beautiful beautiful I've seen this happen a thousand times million times maybe and it still excites me still excites me look at that shoot I can't stop I see something else here let's just bring these right on around right on around I know I'm probably messing up this painting and you're gonna call me bad name sometimes this this starts working so nice though you can't quit it's just fun and painting should make you happy should bring you freedom there we go let's take let's take a little dark Cianna let's put a tree trunk right up there take a little white touch a brown in it just enough to highlight a little bit a little bit of blue in that - it looks like dark sienna why let's put a tree trunk here and there in our big ol evergreens look at that the head easy yeah then I'm going to wash one of these brushes here washing over one inch brush give them a shake a little wrap go right into the liquid white I will pull this through some yellow yellow ochre I'm gonna reach out pick the little dark Seanna want to darken it down a little bit oh yeah that's nice a little bright red - what the heck just go ahead up here now maybe right here look at there there's a happy little Bush that's right there and while we have this on here let's reflect it right into the water just like so and you're more liquid vitamin brush make the paint a little thinner then paint will stick to a thick paint woohoo there's a nice bright one just let him shine out here in the sunshine well there is just look to see where you think a happy little Bush would would live and drop it in drop it anywhere you want him that's where you are be reflected right into the water look it there okay watch that will brush out give him a shake go right into grab a little of that dark Sienna let's go over here there's another happy but all my bushes are happy yours should be too okay gonna add a little thinner to my brush go right into a touch of bright red the yellow ocher okay let's go ahead up here this big ol tree here probably already can really shine really shine and work and layers think about all the little clumps of limbs and bushes in here don't just throw these on at random don't throw one at random there oh well that is a beautiful little tree beautiful little tree and maybe right here send out a little tree and I want to reflect some of this right into the water it's like so now then we tell you what let's do for we get to out here let's pull these down look right there well gentle touch imaginable and go across and that's where you create those beautiful mirror reflections okay here we go there's another little bush another one right there come right out here and drop it another one see just push you after bush however many you want you can use the brush sideways and just pop them right in let him go tell you why maybe there's a happy little path there he is right there take a little color come right around my cat you need a little place to walk around there okay then put some bushes on this side of the path seeing that'll push it down into the painting just let him hang over the PAP few hair in there like so like so that's what wherever you think this should be it's exactly where they should be kind of take a little bit of Van Dyck Brown and we just drop some bland in here a little touch of land here and there little bright red the browned and white a little touch a highlight like so there Oh kind of the nice things happening but a little bit liquid white puts in a little waterline see how that stands out it's really what makes it just work so well maybe just a little ripple here in there wherever you want wherever you want you can take a pop in a few little grassy areas just to break up that straight line yeah then listen you know me and my big trees let's do it again take brown on the fan brush pen Dyck Brown maybe there's a big tree here we go he lives right there he's got a crook any mini comes down he's got another crooked nuts there he is there he needs a friend he needs a friend just like so we can take the knife little white pink just pop in a few little highlights here and there wherever wherever wherever okay our liner brush and a few little limbs and we don't have a finished painting which I better have because I'm running out of time this goes right on nothing put a bin and as many or as few limbs as you want in your world just put them in think you will find this to be one of the most fun things that you've ever done but with the ovals and the contact paper in here in just a second and we'll pull this off and that you see and drop me a line let me know what you're doing with some of these ideas things that you'd like to see I'd love to hear from you just like so see many or as few as you want maybe there's an old stick lives right here Oh Larry yes he's no Crooked Stick somebody stepped on him when he was little you take the knife go back in here scrape out just a few little sticks and twigs all of that helps create the illusion of distance in your painting we'll take a little bit of yellow ochre just highlight this tree just a little don't want much don't lose that nice darkness now then for the big event let's take up right up here let me pull the contact paper off as I'm telling you goodbye for the day and I really hope you've enjoyed this painting it's one of the
