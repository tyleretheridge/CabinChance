hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today today I thought we'd do a fantastic little painting together so I tell you what let's start out and hammer on all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let me tell you what I've already done up here today I have a I have sort of a weird canvas as you can see I've taken some black gesso on the standard Oh 18 to 24 inch canvas here and painted these dark areas with black gesso then I've allowed the black gesso to dry completely now in the light area I've just put a little bit of liquid white and just blended it out and the dark area you caught me footing on a little bit of this is a mixture of phthalo blue SAP green and Van Dyck Brown I want a dull dirty green color and you can sort of test it before you start and all we're doing here is just covering all the dark areas this this color is very transparent so it still looks black and with that I want to show you how to do a scene that looks like you're deep in the woods you know you've walked in the deep woods and the trees are all hanging over this it's quiet and little squirrels are playing and everything that's what we're going to do today so let me just get all this covered all we're looking for is just a nice coat of the dark mixture that we made and now all we have out on the brush let's begin thinking about some general basic tree shapes that live up in here just take the corner of the brush and Ben begin bringing them right on out and to the liquid white all we're looking for here is just very basic shapes think about the big tree that's hanging over here say and you can pick up a little bit of color there just bring those shapes out we'll come back and we'll put a lot of highlights and stuff in there right now all we're looking for our very basic little shapes there just as many or as few as you want in the world okay maybe there's a bush it lives right here see that easy we can put up just a happy little tree there maybe he's got a little friend here who knows wherever you want them okay now over here here's another big tree limb it seems to be protruding over and what are you putting this black gesso on just sort of in your mind have an idea of how you want these trees hanging there and whatever happens we use in my mind I'm beginning to see huge trees that are hanging over here maybe there's a little light coming through be a super place to go and hide all right a few more bushes and trees down in here already you've got the basic shapes here that you're looking for so you know maybe I tell you about us too let's get crazy I want a bigger tree right here in the center and in your world if you want a tree to grow all you have to do is make it grow a little bit maybe there's some little shapes you can see we back here better little trees in between there we're not looking for a lot of detail in there but already that's beginning to give you the appearance of a lot of mists and things happening okay maybe up in here we back in the distance somewhere there's a little something wherever and you can just hear in there but all kinds of little soft things there we go have it let's have some fun let's take the script liner brush dip it into some paint thinner and I'll go back into some Van Dyck Brown and that same color that we just we just made the little trees out of you want this paint to be thin like ink turn the brush that loads of bristles and brings the bristles to a nice sharp point okay now maybe back in here there's just the indication here and there of some little tree trunks and limbs and sticks and twigs and all kinds of little things happening there just sort of make a decision where you think they should live and drop them in so there is to it there we go see back in here very light we don't want a lot of detail back in here it's too far away we can't see a lot of detail there's one there is another one just however many that you want there so you can create all kinds of illusions here and if you have trouble making this paint flow add a little bit more paint thinner if it doesn't flow chances are you don't have quite enough paint thinner on your brush because a thin paint will slide right over here okay looks like we've painted a whole forest already and we've done very little work now then I'll just take a little bit more of the paint thinner garretta to a touch of that titanium white and same thing bring it to a nice sharp point and then we can put just the indication here and there of some little tree trunks that are a little bit lighter there and that's super all right and then let's start having some fun we'll take a one inch brush today and you could do this with your 2 inch brush you're a fan brush I sort of like to use them the old 1 inch brush I'm going to dip it into the least little touch of liquid white just to thin the paint a little pull it right through the color be right back I'm gonna rub a little of dark color we have on the canvas so it turns into a beautiful green there now load a lot of paint into the bristles and tap it tap downward downwards I kept that loads the bristles kinescope here and maybe maybe maybe right in here see there's leaves on this tree just happy little leaves and we're looking for shape here and form don't just throw these in at random think about think about the little worms that live in there there we go work on one tree or Bush at a time they can pick up a little yellow ocher hearing their little Indian yellow may be right there just sort of look around and see what it looks like it ought to be little bushes and trees just begin building all kinds of little things in here maybe over here but we don't want to paint all of them leave some of them dark there we go maybe back in here just here and there the indication of a few things don't want a lot of detail here but we see these little stems and branches and stuff so we want a few little things that are happening in there but not many not many I don't want to lose that illusion of distance and softness back in here there we go all ready that should begin if you're painting along with me at home you should begin having the the appearance that you're deep in the woods and it's just a quiet little place as I say this is where all the little rabbits hydeia squirrels play I still have a little pet squirrel that lives with me there we built him agreed big cage we call it squirrel Hilton son of a guns got two stories in it little pip house and he he lives quite well he's almost ready to go back to nature okay just to all kinds of little happy things back in here but working layers here do one brush at a time always working forward forward forward and that helps create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting that looks like some places I've been in Oregon we out west there where they have all these big ferns and stuff that grow out in the woods let's see how the layers are creating the depth that's what's important it makes your painting really stand out there now sometimes we want to make the indication that maybe a little light shining through these trees so I'll show you how to do that we just take the fan brush loop a little bit of the CAD yellow there we are little yellow little green let's go up in here and just sort it random thang red light would shine through just sort of hit it spin it a little bit here and there don't want too much of this just bend the brush you can even pick up a little touch of the white if you want to brighten it even more just hit and spin grind that brush you know you're not going to hurt it there we go then with a clean dry two inch brush very lightly you can just blend this out see there let's go back over here let's sort of blend that out a little bit and we put some put some leaves and stuff on these big trees that'll help give us the impression that there's there's little bits of light shining through there okay let's go back into our yellows and greens with a one inch brush must begin working forward on some of these big trees tap some color into the brush Pat it just touch and tap that's all you're doing is just tapping using the corner of the brush tapping tapping once again think about individual limbs here don't just throw this in at random there we go the yellow ocher once in a while just to change it brighten it up make it stand out it's a great big tree back in here and we're putting some limbs that are going to be in the back that we're going to put some trunks on we'll put a few more highlights in the foreground there we go so you just drop these in I like doing these little paintings this black gesso is one of the most fantastic things it opens whole new worlds to you I love the black canvases they are so fantastic probably some of the most striking effects in this technique are accomplished on a black canvas okay while we're doing that let's go to the other side on this old tree here we'll drop in a few things but look how color stands out on this you would never get this kind of effect on a white canvas there okay maybe right here I can't just sort of think about limbs that live inside this tree think about shape and form I know you get tired here let me say that but it's so important they're just one layer after another you can almost hear the birds in here did you get to see the little blue Jia head on a couple of the shows in this series my little son again something else I've worried him from the bird lady herd might see he's a loner bird just bar him for day or two at a time there we go now then maybe just begin thinking about what's going on in here and what's happening and let's take some black I see I see you right over it here maybe let's have let's go right up in here maybe there's some tree trunks come right down through here there they are and have many trees you want a new world just put them in this is just straight midnight black just straight or black it's all there is to it there's a couple let's put a third button there maybe there's a little and it lives in here right there among those two pigments and we can take our liner brush paint thinner on it a little bit of the black want this color once again to be thin like ink so it'll flow on the canvas we can come right back in here and let's begin just putting the indication here and there listen happy little tree limbs in to live out in the woods there as I mentioned earlier if you had trouble making your paint flow add a little bit more paint than or to it there we go there's one it comes right over in there however whatever painting is so individual you sort of look at your painting and you make it the way you want it we each see nature through different eyes okay watch the old brush now then let's put some highlights on top of that I'm going back into the same color same ol one inch brush and I'm just going to add a little brighter yellow I want this to stand out a little better because it's going to be in front here there we go now we can put some happy little things on there even this now our yellows are made to a thinner consistency than the other colors but if you have trouble making a stick then add a little touch of the paint thinner to the yellow and then they'll come right off your brush there we are that fantastic and you can do this there's no big secret to it we give you all the secrets right here on the show all you need is the desire a little imagination and some practice just practice a little there we are seeing that pushes those tree trunks right back into that massive trees are that easy okay let me find the big two-inch brush that's cool right into a little bit more of this yellow maybe there's some land here I won't take the two-inch brush and just tap make up a little dark color so my green will get darker there we go now tap it give it a little push push maybe there's some land here some soft little grassy areas just take the two-inch brush and all you have to do is just tap just tap just like so see there where we can begin creating the illusion of just little Hills back here start the father's two way and work forward forward forward there we go layer after layer after layer and this can be as soft as velvet see I should put it in first before I put these trees could you just put it right over and we'll pull the trees back through there a little bit more right in there there we go it'll end in yell a little touch of the bright red here and there move that's nice is it sort of an orangey flavor and maybe over here this one here will come right down and right in the foreground comes right in the front of that one you have that much power though you can make the land go anywhere that you want it to go in your world anywhere that you want it to go there this is where I want to live you can tell already okay maybe up in here let's put a little bush it lives right here in the corner just sort of bring all that together still just using the corner of the one inch brush and a little bit of black I want to bring these trees back down into the painting here I cut them off with a grass but I want them to live right there so we can pull them right back in the foreground that easy you can move mountains you can change trees anything that you want to do here anything that you want to do that easy all right I tell you what let's have fun I love water I love what I would put it in just about everything that I paint let's take just a little plain titanium white and let's have us a little pond here just take the white and pull straight down it's going to pick up that color it's already on the canvas and automatically automatically we're going to have a nice happy little pond or whatever you want here a little bit of water there all I'm using is just straight titanium white but it's important that you pull straight down when you do this even if you put your brush crooked pull straight down otherwise it it just won't look right just won't look right now after you get this in very gently very gently come across and these lines should be straight across there and that fantastic that you can create water that easy you can you can I tell people all the time on this piece of canvas you can do anything that you want to do and you really care this is total freedom here I'm using a little dark sand a little white little Van Dyck Brown put it on the knife let's go right up here and let's just put the indication in here of a touch of the land and all I'm doing is just rubbing very hard it's pushing that color right into the canvas I want to look like like little sandbars of dirt sitting here this water in my mind is not very deep it's not very deep it's out here in the woods it's just maybe a maybe a little puddle from a big rain or something I don't want it to be real deep take a little that titanium white and to that I'm going to add the least little touch of dark C and I want it to be light but I don't want to pure white and I'm just going to cut off a tedious tiniest little roll of paint okay now then all you have to do just want to put the indication here and there but a little waterline actually all I'm looking for here is a little light color between these darks just enough to set it apart there see how that makes it stand out fantastic if you ever get one let's say you have one here it's too bright all you have to do is rub it it'll pick up that dark color this underneath and automatically it'll go away and maybe I'll tell you what let's go back to our two inch brush tap in a little more color maybe maybe maybe in our world maybe our land comes right down here like so let's get crazy let's bring it right on down just let your imagination go where do you want it there look how soft that is and a super place to just take your shoes off and sort of run barefooted there we go little Indian yellow but the yellow ocher here in there just to change the flavor some era wants to haul the least little touch of the bright red these little touch don't need to get bright red when you mix that with the ochres and yellows and greens makes a very nice little color okay shoes we bad cat this rascal fix won't clean that edge up a little okay now then you know me shoot I like big trees so let's let's get crazy then we'll take the small knife go right up here and I'm gonna get a big roll of Van Dyck Brown a lot of Van Dyck Brown on the knife and let's decide maybe maybe maybe maybe does now we have a big tree a strong tree and he lives right there right there now if you're near painting if you don't want a big tree just leave him out I like it because it pushes everything in the painting back look at that though that easy and easy you can make a big old tree let's give him a big strong foot down here got to have something to stand on won't even fall over in the lake and make a big splash there we go okay now that let's put some highlights on that we use some white a bright red in it like so okay cut off that small rule of paint and it's right on the edge of the knife and here all I'm going to do is just touch the canvas all you have to do is touch it'll pull off what it wants keep you back what's left just want to put the indication here and there some highlight on this trunk see what all you doing it's just touching the canvas you need to load the knife correctly that little roll of paint is so important you'll make everything work nice there and just let it blend backwards getting darker and darker darker as it comes back around the side tire guitar guitar so you can make the indication of a little hole in the tree down here just by leaving at a very dark and working around it now the other side you can take a little white least little touch of Prussian blue and just put the indication here and there of a little bit of reflected light not too much just a little wipe off the knife now you take just a touch of Van Dyck Brown sort of put in the center here and bring it all together that'll just bring those two colors together and it really makes it look like it looks like a real tree truck it looks like real bark on there you could feel it when it gets dry now then I'm gonna take paint thinner paint thinner go right into my Van Dyck Brown I want this thin like ink again no you get tired of hearing that too but it's important if you want this to flow maybe right here Arius big old tiredly lives now he just sort of hangs out around here this is where if you have a little nervous twitch in your hand it really pays dividends because these old tree limbs look better if they're they sort of cook addy there we go a little bit more paint and however many limbs you want put them on maybe there's another one yep you're right it is right there right there but see how easy that is you can do it you can do it I get I get so many letters and people we liked sometimes we put some of these letters in our newsletter and send them out and let you read those too but in these letters people are talking about how they never dreamed never dreamed that they could paint and they watch the show look through the books etc and they're producing fantastic paintings a little more the cutter on here let's put some leaves on this tree all we're gonna do here just tap think about some general shapes and just drop in some happy little things here and there wherever you want there we are just drop a few little things in but isn't it fantastic that easy you can complete a scene in a half an hour or so or whatever long it takes it looks like you're deep deep in the woods and you're in there with all of god's little creatures and it's a super day and i've enjoyed being with you and from all of us here i'd like to wish you happy painting god bless i look forward to seeing you again Oh Oh you
