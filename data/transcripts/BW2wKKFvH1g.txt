- Welcome back, glad to see you again. Thought today we'd do just
a happy little picture that's deep in the woods. And for those of you who're
joining us for the first time, I'm gonna ask 'em to graphically
run the colors through, so you can see all the colors that we use and that I have on my palette today. And while they're doing that,
I think we'll get started. I'm gonna take off here today with a little bit of the thalo blue, using the large brush, and really work this
color into the bristles, just beat it into the bristles. And let's just make a happy
little sky real quick. Most of the sky, I think,
will probably disappear, so we just put a very simple
basic little sky up here and go from there and see what happens. Work this paint back and forth, making little crisscross patterns. There we go, just a nice,
quick, gentle little sky. (brush swishes) Now, without cleaning the brush, I think I'll just go right
into some Van Dyke brown, little bit of burned umber,
just mix it on the brush, and some sap green. Maybe a tiny little bit of Prussian blue, just very dark, nice colors, and let's just go right in here and begin dropping in some
happy little trees and bushes, and let's just see what happens. Just let 'em flow off your brush. (brush thumps, easel rattles) Um, look at there already. Already we got all those
good things happening. Maybe there's a big one over here. (brush thumps) Yeah, just drop 'em in. Okay, a little brown,
sap green, touch of blue. Maybe, maybe there's a
large one over here, too. We'll just sort of close this one in. Push, we need to bend these bristles. There we go. This is one of the reasons you need a very, very strong easel. If you've noticed the
easel that I'm using here, it's made from a platform ladder, which you can pick up at
most any hardware store, or you can use any type of ladder. But it makes a very, very
strong, dependable easel. (brush thuds rapidly) Okay. Then we'll take a little
bit of the Van Dyke brown and just lay a little right
in here and pop upward, just to put some dark color back in there. All we're doing is touching, pop up, just like so. Just here and there. And I'm gonna take the fan brush, we'll load some brown and some
umber mixed together here. There we are. And we'll just put a
few little indications of some trunks back in here. Just a little background trees. Maybe some little
indications here and there. There. Oops, there's one that's nice and crooked. Hate for them all to be straight. Maybe a fisherman kicked that one when he was just a little baby, and he's got a little crook in him. There we go. Just here and there, drop in
a few of these little trunks. All right. Now we can take the one inch brush, add a little bit of magic white to it, and let's begin highlighting these. Now I'll use a little bit of cad yellow. Need a touch more of the magic white. Cad yellow and some sap green. Yellow and green mixed together. Mix it on the brush, so you
have a multitude of colors happening in the brush. Okay, now we can begin
highlighting some of these. Just touch, but all those little leaves just come right off your brush. There. And maybe a little on this little tree. Now I'm beginning to add
just a tiny, tiny bit of ochre to it, yellow ochre, just to change the color a little bit. And at home, you can do these
in any color that you like. Any color. It's really the technique that
we're trying to teach here. These colors stand out
very well on television, so we use colors that are quite bright. But you can use very subdued,
quiet colors at home. Whatever makes you happy,
because this is your world. Add a little touch of
permanent red to it now. Just to change the flavor. There we go. Okay. Let's get a clean brush. A little bit more of the
yellow and the sap green. Once again, mix it on the brush. We'll go right in here and, ah, look at there, nice little
bush happening right there. All kinds of little things
going on in the background. (brush thuds rapidly) There we go. Now, I wanna take this
brown that I put on here, I wanna take the large
brush, grab a hold of it, and begin pulling down. It's sort of like these
little paintings just happen. And you noticed another thing here, we've put no color into the water. All we're gonna use for color in the water is what we pull down. You don't have to go to a lot of trouble and put color in here. All you do is pull it down. Just wipe across to give
it a nice watery sheen, and it looks like water
without doing a thing. Okay. Let's take a little touch
more of the Van Dyke brown. This is mixed with a
little bit of the ochre. And begin forming some
little banks back in here. There. Just let's let these little banks happen. Now take a little brown and white, and the least little touch of blue in it. There we go. Maybe a touch more of the umber. Oh yeah, there. Lay a little highlight on here. Just a little, just a
little, let it break. Maybe a little touch over in here. There. Now, let's use a fan
brush a little bit today. I'll use a little bit
of the yellow and green that's laying down here, and we'll begin popping in all kind of little grassy areas. Just let 'em run right on back in to the deep woods here. Very soft, very quiet. There we go, um. Look at the depth in there already. And we really haven't done anything. We didn't paint any
water, it just happened. We really haven't done a great deal. There. Okay, now, I'm gonna grab a
bottle of these to clean 'em up, and also to create reflections. Just pull across. And when you pull this across, try to keep these lines
as straight as possible, this way. Don't want your water to
run out of the picture. Now, a little bit of magic white, little touch of brown into it to dull it, and we can begin adding
some water lines in here. All kind of little things happening. We just sort of let this
little body of water wander around the distance. We don't know where it's going back here. We really don't care. (scraping) Just letting it have fun. (scraping) Um. There. Okay, let's take a
little more of the white, magic white, little yellow ochre, maybe a little touch of
the permanent red into it, and let's put some highlights
on this little tree. Ooh, that was pretty. There we go. Just let 'em run right out of your brush. They hide in there. Sometimes you have to just push 'em out. But they're in there. Okay. Now, let's take a little more of the brown and ochre mixed together, Van Dyke brown, burned umber, and begin
making some more land masses right out through here. (scraping) Maybe there's another one over here. I know, I know, I know. Just had an idea here. You'll do that one again. We will make a nice
little bank right here. I need a little place I can go out here and set and fish and catch a big old bass that lives out here. (scraping) There. (metallic scraping) Now we can add a little
bit of highlight to that. Just right along the top here. I wanna make this look high. The strokes are very important, the angle of the strokes here. There we go. Knew you could do it. Now, little bit of highlight
on this over here, like so. And with the large brush, once again, we'll grab this and pull
down, straight down. And then just gently come across. Same thing over here. Just pull down. Okay, now. We'll firm this one up a little bit. He got a little weak on the ends, so we'll just firm him up. Little touch of highlight on him. Let a little light play
through there and strike him. Little water line. (scraping) there we go. Now, now, now, you can,
you can, right there, just bring it right on down. (metallic scraping) There. Little bit of highlight. Like so. Large brush, pull down, just to create the illusion of water. In painting, painting your work with a great deal of illusions. There. Little bit of the magic
white, make us a water line. There we go. (scraping) Now we'll take the fan brush, little bit of yellow and ochre, looks like there's a little
permanent red in there, just whatever happens to
be later in your palette. There we go. These pictures are
designed as guides for you. With the ideas that we give you here, we hope that you just go
absolutely wild with this and paint your own masterpieces, put your own dreams on canvas. 'Cause painting should make you happy. Okay, just take a little
touch of the magic white, little bit of yellow, and just put a happy little
bush that lives right here. There he is. Okay. And we just sort of bring
this together back here with a little darker paint in there so it looks like it's
going back into the woods. There. Okay, now. Let's see what we're gonna do
over here on this other side. Maybe there's another little projection that comes right out here like this. Who knows? It's your world, you create
your own visions here. And we need something for it to sit on. There we are. Now what I did there is
just picked up a little bit of the magic white, so I can put just a very small, small
amount of highlight into that. Don't want a lot, just a tiny, tiny bit. Okay, now we'll take the large brush, grab the bottom of it
again, and pull down. Always paint these reflections. And come across. And let's put some little
water lines underneath these. There we go. (scraping) And maybe out here on this
little peninsula that we built, maybe there's an old tree lives out here. If you're going out here to fish, you need a nice tree to sit underneath, keep the sun off your head. So we're gonna just run an old tree right up through here. Let's give him a other side here. There. Trees need two sides. There we go. And we'll take just a tiny
bit of the permanent red mixed with some umber, and let's put some highlight on here. Just touch, just touch
and pull the knife up. There we go. Little bit up in here. Like so. And let's put a happy
little limb out here. That limb goes out like that, there, and drops back into the painting. Who knows? Just drops right back in. There. Little bit of highlight on the limb. Okay. Now, little bit of reflected
light on the other side, just gonna use a little Prussian blue, just to create the illusion
of a little reflected light. Like so. There. Now when that one dries, you'll be able to feel the bark on him. Okay. Now, I need a lot of little limbs, but we don't have much time. So let me just shoot some in here. There we go, just drop 'em in. There. Just put 'em in. Maybe there's a little
one comes right out here, who lives right out through there. And when you're doing this at home, use a liner brush with a
little bit of thin oil. And let's try something
a little different today. Maybe we'll put highlights
or leaves on here just using a palette knife. And we'll take a little bit of sap green mixed with some ochre, just mix it til it's marbly. There. A little bit of paint on the knife, and we're just barely, barely, barely gonna let it touch the canvas. Just barely touch. And we can drop some little
brighter highlights on there so they stand out a little. Barely, barely, barely touch. Just about touching the canvas with it. Maybe there's some right up in here. Okay. Now, let's bring some more
stuff right down through here. (scraping) Like that. Van Dyke brown again, little
bit of burned umber in it. And with a large brush, once again, we'll create a little reflection there. Come straight across. Now then, let's take our fan brush with a little bit of
the sap green, yellow, little touch of permanent
red here and there, mix 'em all up together. Let's put some little grassy
areas coming down through here. And your color's gonna begin picking up the brown underneath. It makes all kind of pretty
little things happen. Just let it happen, don't fight it. Maybe I'll take a little touch, little touch of highlight and just lay in here. And then we'll run grass
around that highlight. We keep this part quite dark. Don't want it to get too bright on us. Something like so. Okay. We'll take the knife, make
us a happy little water line, just flows along here. And all we're really looking for here is a light area to separate
the water from the land, just to create a separation in here. Few little sticks here and there. (scraping) That tree was so much fun,
I wanna do another one. Maybe right here, maybe
there's a big tree. Just let him fall right off your knife. (vocalizes swooshing sound) Great, big tree. There we go. Little bit of the permanent red mixed with a little burned umber. And we can drop some happy
little highlights on this tree. Like so. And we need some, need some limbs on him. So we'll stick one right about here, let him go right on off
the canvas somewhere. And maybe there's another one over here, just like that. A little bit of highlight on him. There we go. There we go. Little bit of blue, for
the refracted light. There. Just a little, just a little. Now, back into the brown, and just begin dulling
him, working it together. Okay. Now, maybe here we'll mix some lighter-colored leaves on this one. Use some permanent red. Just indication that there's
some leaves up in here. There. How's that? And maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe there's a little limb that comes right down through here. Just let these little
limbs wander everywhere. They're really pretty. Maybe over in here. Okay. Little bit more of our color, barely touch your canvas. Barely, barely touch the canvas. Need a little bit of bright yellow here, just to highlight, just a touch. There we go. Okay. Let's go right over, right over here and maybe we'll put
just a small little one right here in the foreground. Just a sort of wandering around, having a good time. Just a little tiny one. A little bit of highlight on him. There. And put a couple of limbs on him, just here and there. Few of 'em will show. Okay. That gives us some instant limbs. This time, I'll use the brush. Take a little bit of
the greenish color here. The yellow with a little
bit of sap green in it. A lot of paint on the brush. And then what I'm gonna do is just touch, just to make some very loose little leaves hanging around here, tiny little leaves. Okay. Like so. Maybe something growing
right down at the bottom. Okay, a few little sticks here and there. This painting is getting
close to being done. (scraping) And I think it was a lot of fun. If you were painting
along with us at home, I hope you have a happy heart by now and you're really beginning to stand back and admire what you done. Oh, it's just fantastic what can be done. All you need to do is
practice a little bit. Take a basic technique that
we give you here and use it. Okay. Another little thing
that sometimes is fun, maybe we'll put some little
things out here in the water. I'll start with using
a little bit of yellow, then a little bit of
ochre right underneath it. Just like so. And some Van Dyke brown all
the way under the bottom of it. Then with a nice, clean fan brush, very gently, just kind of lift up. Just lift up. There we go, just lift it up. Let all these little things happen. Just some little things
floating around in the water. And let's take a little
more of the magic white and just put a little water
line underneath here, like so. Just gives it a little
something in the water to break it up a little. There. (scraping) I think we're just about ready
to call this one finished, so maybe get a little
bit of thin oil here, and we'll sign this one. Next week, we're gonna
be doing a black canvas. You can pick up one at
your local art store. If you're preparing it yourself, paint it with a flat black acrylic and allow it to dry. And next week, we'll
do a fantastic picture. So, until then, from all of us here, God bless and happy painting. (gentle music)
