hey welcome back certainly glad to see you today I thought today we just do a fantastic little winter scene I think you'll enjoy this one so I tell you what as usual let's start out and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me at home while they're doing that let me just show you here I've got standard old canvas up here and we just covered it with a nice thin even coat of liquid white it's all wet slick it's ready to go so let's go out today we'd start with a little big old two inch brush we'll go right up in here and get a little touch of the cadmium yellow our CAD yellow whatever you want to call it let's just make a beautiful warm little sky up here just using a little bit of yellow a lot of times winter scenes can be so cold that they're almost distracting so I thought today would make one that's very warm and very pleasant okay now then without cleaning the brush go right back into a small amount of yellow ochre just load a little bit into the bristles you don't need much just sort of tap it in there that's fine and we'll go right into here there so you just add a little bit of that golden color like so wherever you want to tell you what let's have some water here maybe we'll have a happy little pond in here what the heck so we'll take the same color let's take a little that yellow come right down here directly below it and just do something like that shoot just have fun just pull it down then back to our yellow ocher a little bit on each side more there everybody knows waters not like Etna it's a waterfall but we'll play with it here in just a second I'm going to go right into a little touch of the bright red very small amount it's very strong and it'll set your whole world on fire in just a heartbeat maybe right out here on the edges a little touch of the red just to make it warm Red's a very it's a very warm color makes you feel good there we are a little bit maybe on the other side we don't want it left out we just sort of blend all that together there now then take a little that red and we'll just put it right down the sides here like so see that continually mixes with the liquid right that's here when you get this beautiful blending effect without even trying shoot let the canvas work let the liquid light work painting should be fun and we try to make it fun for you there just sort of let those colors blend together we have a masterpiece for the Museum of Modern Art already we can stop right here there you can call it acid rain that'll be the title of this one all right okay now then I need something in the top up here so let's take tiny tiny bit of phthalo blue reach right up here get a little bit of black so we have blue and black or black and blue whichever you prefer we don't need much color so just a little tap into the bristles there we go using little crisscross strokes we'll just fill in the remainder of the sky there very nice sort of a grayish blue color just sort of let that all blend together man we can put a little bit here whatever let's wash our old brush there's the screen in the bottom of here that I scrubbed the bristles against shake them off and just beat the devil out of now with a clean dry brush just blend this together that brush clean is the most fun part of this whole technique and take out all your frustrations there very lightly very lightly now down here all we want to do here knock off the excess paint let's just blend this out like so it'll all come together and then it'll begin looking like water or we get a little further into the painting we don't know exactly where we want the water to be at this point and we really don't care all we're trying to do is just lay a little color on there maybe what's your what your what you have an idea maybe there'll be a nice bright streak in there so we'll take we'll just use a fan brush here and just really mash in here a little bit of straight titanium white it's really get tough with it then go across see that she will remain in there it'll be in there when we're all finished there and it'll be very bright right now it doesn't show up much but wait we put some dark colors around there okay I'm going to take an old we use a 1h brush take a touch of the alizarin crimson a little bit of phthalo blue like so much more crimson than blue proportionately they hadn't let me clean the knife off take our 1h brush take a touch of this and maybe we'll just come right along in here and very gently very gently let's just rub in a happy little cloud here there just making little circles okay and we use this lavender color because you can get away with putting it against the yellow without a turning bright green if us to use pure blue we'd be an agony city right now because we'd have a bright green sky and in this particular painting we don't want that okay now we take a clean brush two inch brush just rub this a little bit that removes the excess paint that's all we're doing just sort of blending it together and removing some of the excess paint there yeah then use old fan brush Oh fan brush okay we'll take some titanium white I will reach down here be right back don't go away there get a little touch of the bright red doesn't take much it's very strong there we are just a nice nice hot pink color let's go right up in here now maybe it's a little high light lives right up here on top of this cloud there we go just a little just a little just to warm this kaya we did a seascape in this series it had a sky that started like this same basic idea same basic idea so if you did that one with me this one would be a snap for you there all we're doing is just putting a highlight color on there maybe maybe it's a happy little thing it floats right along here I don't know I don't know clouds are so free just sort of let them go wherever they want to now we use just the top corner of the brush just just blend that there all the blending is the base of the highlight they're round and around and around we go there we are see just blend it blend it blend it blend it then we'll fluff it up a little bit there and very lightly see it looks like a big circle of Krell's just floating around they're having a good time it's a very nice and effective little sky I think you'll like it hope you try that one now then maybe back in here there's a bunch of little trees and stuff and all kinds of happy thank you imma get it we use a round brush today let's start out let me take a little bit of Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna shoot a little loser in crimson it doesn't matter we just mainly looking for a dark color be right back add a little bit of white into it mostly Browns up tap the brush firmly into the paint there we go now that you have to make a big decision this is this is one of your first big decisions decide three little tree shapes are going to live I just begin tapping in some very basic little shapes all we're looking for basic basic shapes nothing else very very basic we'll come back we'll add some nice highlights this point only looking for basic shape just a block in color there we go maybe there it goes way over I don't know wherever you want it to go make a big decision and drop it in take you what we just take the knife here and there was scraping the indication of little branch in the twig and the stick and all those little things that live deep in the trees and the bushes I just used the same old brush we'll go into a little yellow go yellow ocher touch the bright red little Indian yellow but mix the color on the brush that way you have a multitude of things happening on the brush let's go up here now then begin picking out little individual tree shapes just tap go slightly slightly above the dark so that way you don't have any shadows on the top you want the shadows to be in the tree not on the top there maybe this little rascal right here there we are but working layer so you have distance and depth in your painting we don't want this a whole flat thing laying out here distance in here that's what makes your painting stand out makes it special there we go little bit in here just wherever you want this whole round brush will just jump right in there and make hundreds of little trees that easy see see the the depth in here is caused because you leave dark area see that dark area so most important it's valuable it's good friend don't kill it take care of it talk to it sorry to people look at you like your little strange so okay you tell them we gave you permission because you need those dark areas in there it's the only way you make these stand out there we go and then tell you what true let's get crazy we'll take a 2 inch brush and go right into some titanium white maybe there's some snow there so we'll just take some white load a lot of white onto the large brush you have to make another major decision here where did you snow live maybe maybe yep you're right in our world it's going to be right there that's all you got to do just lay it in now we'll come back and begin blending just blend it all together and it'll pick up a little bit of that yellow in the peach color and all that in here that's wonderful that is wonderful don't fight it use it use it to your advantage allow all those colors just to come together there to make your painting beautiful okay maybe over in here you had to start making some vague decisions of where it is where did you snow live right along there okay and then you take a clean brush and anything it you don't want you just pull it straight down and it'll blend right in with that color and just becomes part of the reflections now we'll take our knife would take least little touch of the dark see in a little bit of white and I just want a light brown color there but without flat cut across tiniest little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife decide where your waterline is and with just a very small amount of paint a lot of pressure just sort of lay in a little little indication of a water line there they're just nice little dark color there we go now we could take a fan brush if we wanted maybe we'll take a little the colors that we use the Reds and that yellows just mix them together like so maybe there's some little areas here and there there this little bush is it grow right down into the snow see just make a decision decide where they are pop them in into your world you can do anything that you want to do now grab that pull it blend the base of it right into the snow and it's that easy that easy now it's time to start making some big decisions here what's on the sides of this I'm going back and told my Browns and lavenders and whatever color we got going here we just tap them right in maybe there's an ash tree that lives over here all we do again as we did before by tapping in a very basic little shape just a very basic little shape that's all we're looking for there we'll worry about details when we put the highlights in right now all we're doing is painting the back of the tree that's a good way to think about it we're painting the back of the tree we put a trunk in this one maybe and that'll be the center of the tree and then we'll come back and we'll paint the front of the tree which is the highlights or the bright colors there we go you have to make a big decision maybe what part of this to be reflection so take a large brush grab it and pull straight down just pull it down and go straight across and we have instant reflections - that was fun there would be something on the other side - let's do that we'll take some of those same colors tap them into the round brush here maybe over here lives a big ole tree a big tree so I know it's growing over here but that's the beauty of painting this way you just sort of let things evolve let them happen don't worry about it don't worry about it just get an idea in your mind let it go drop it in wherever you want learn to create as you paint there we go right in here there tell you what you know it's interesting in the last series in the last series we showed a little baby al I hope you've seen that he was built so big he was just a little ball of fur in fact I think I remark that he had the same hair stylist as I do because he was nothing but a ball of fur we have got so many cards and letters asking about that little rascal I thought today when we took a trip out to the bird lady's house let me show you how hoots do it and I think you'll enjoy seeing what's going on with you because he's no longer little baby look at this rascal he's an hour full-grown al and he is absolutely beautiful I set the talked with hoot for a little while and a little nervous getting in the cage that Center again we got some big toes look at the claws there and that was his way of saying that's enough no more Paul we were there we talked with Diana Shafer the bird lady and she had allowed us to look at some of the little creatures that she had you know me I mean we go for the birds and I had to play with a little birds this is some little sparrows they're just very young only a week or two not even probably a week or two old just probably a few days off and they were fantastic I had to I had to spend a couple of minutes with Elmen of course give him a little something to eat here's diana and diana loves all animals she's one of the few people I know that would take a baby groundhog they had been orphaned and take care of that little rascal and she plays with it like a little kitten yessuh during this thing I think I've ever seen and he's very very cute very tame and just just a joy to play with this beautiful hawk here came from Alaska and he lost a wing I hate to say this is a wild turkey that Diana's raising and she has a male and a female wild turkey her husband John is quite a turkey hunter this everything's not great in life this was a little Robin that was borned with no eyes he's blind so I had to see him and here's my little friend again these little sparrows are some of the cutest little things and nothing but mouths and they eat continually it'll certainly give you something to do if you're taking care of one of those Oh hoot oh he's he's grown by the time you see this show he will have been turned loose and he'll be long gone he's probably by the time you see this he'll probably have a little condo in Miami and house payments of BMW in the driveway he'll be like the rest of us all trapped with responsibilities he may even have children of his own I'm just using a little bit of brown here a little paint thinner putting in some little tree trunk indications back here far far away okay tell you what we need a little snow under there so I'll just take that old big brush come right in here maybe there's a little little snowy area right there right there just sort of drop it in wherever you want it and don't worry about anything that didn't come out just right all you have to do is turn it into part of the reflections just take a clean brush grab it and pull down and that easy turns it into just instant reflections if it comes very pretty in your painting a little bit of the brown a little land in there there off we go tell you what let's get crazy maybe that comes right on out here where do you want it and your world you just sort of make a big decision and drop it in wherever you want it to be that's exactly where it should be there we go and then I then bring it right on down so it just goes on and off the canvas shoot what we get that you wanna screw on the other side here I need a little snow right in here once again don't worry about it being perfect because anything that you don't like you just grab it go straight down and it becomes part of the reflections that have the accident they end up being very pretty very very pretty I find the old round brush here we go back to some of our colors yellows and yellow ocher in all those a little bright red here in there little Indian yellow very subdued just a few little things happening back in here there we go but I want this very subdued I'm gonna put a tree in front of it I think so I want this to be quiet but it's far back in there there we are see there's a little bush it is right out here the sons playing across him it's a nice place to live here another room and your world you just decide however many you want make layers of them though that's what gives you painting depth and distance that all those little things just happen there where okay let's go on the other side over here we don't with this tree left out take the liner brush a little paint thinner a little bit of the brown just pull in the indication of a little trunk and this is it helps here if you if you a little nervous let your hand sort of wiggle and jiggle that way you end up with a tree that has some character to it it's just not an old Street boring tree there okay I really hope you enjoyed seeing hoot and the other little creatures we as I say we have got so many so many cards and calls wanting to know about hoot and how he did was the okay I just wanted to show you how he's doing today he is one of the most beautiful creatures I've ever had the honor of knowing and and showing you on the program and I feel sort of like he's sort of like he's one of mine because I watched him grow up and hopefully I'll get to see him released off you go and people like the bird lady here they devote a tremendous amount of their time and energy to taking care of these creatures and she's not paid she does all this out of her own pocket and the world needs people like that they're special they're special there we go little brown down here back to them yeah take our little fan brush and we can pop in a few little things here just to break up that straight line so it's not quite so boring take a knife put in some sticks and some twigs and all those happy little things that you would have in your world some over here and normally these little sticks and twigs go into dark areas not the light areas they go into dark areas and you know me how he's like he's big trees I get in more trouble these big trees sometimes director comes out here and yells at me for waiting to the last minute to do this but I like big trees and if you don't want this in your painting don't worry about it leave it out I think - nor to be a big tree right here though I like these trees in paintings because they push everything back just makes your perspective different I think it's very exciting to have these in and it's also it's also your bravery test we take a little touch of white at least little touch a dark sienna in it and let's just go along here and let the knife just tap just tap the canvas we'll take off what it wants give you back what's left that's all you have to do let the knife and the canvas work let it work there there we go I'm gonna try put some some more pictures of of hoot in her newsletter so you can see see him from the time he was just a little baby till the time he's released so maybe you'll get a chance to see him in there but take a little touch of the phthalo blue and white quite dark and I'm just going to indicate a little shadow reflected light on the opposite side a little dark right in there Van Dyck Brown we'll add all that interest by tapping it'll all blend together and you can make it as dark or as light as you want but that creates that illusion of roundness in your tree that helps create it okay find my liner brush here there it is get to watch these brushes sometime they sneak off on you their little paint thinner little brown now then maybe maybe there's an arm on this old tree lives right there just a little arm now this is done with an extremely thin paint when you do this if you have trouble making it slide across the canvas chances are it's not thin enough adds more paint thinner and it'll work for you there we go maybe here and there it is just indication alone liquid black works extremely well for just laying in the little tree limbs and stuff let's take some dark paint we'll just use some black and some blue and some crimson whatever round brush will tap in some nice limbs up in here there we go wherever you want this dark is only so our lighter color will show up when we put it in not much I don't want to lose all that nice background that we work so hard to get in there okay I will dip the brush into liquid white it's another round brush and then go into my yellows and all that just tap the color and with that let's put a few highlights on here should think we're button about to have a finished painting here I hope you've enjoyed this one and also hope you enjoyed seeing hoot all of his friends and I look forward to seeing you next time yo clock on the wall tells me I better leave you for the day so we'll call this one finished try it I believe you'll like it from all of us here happy painting and God bless my friend you
