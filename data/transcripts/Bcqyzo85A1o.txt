- Hi, welcome back. I'm glad to see you again. And today, I think we'll
do a vertical painting, fantastic little painting,
and maybe we'll put a couple of little buildings in it. And I'm going to ask them to
graphically run all the colors across the screen that
I'll be using today, and they'll come to you in the same order that I have them on my palette. And while they're doing
that, let's get started. I've already covered the
canvas with a thin even coat of magic white, and it's wet
and slick and ready to go. So I'm going to go right in here with a two and a half-inch brush. We'll take a little bit of Prussian blue, and I'm going to pull that
out and really beat it into the bristles to get
a nice even distribution of paint. And let's go right up to
the canvas and let's just let this bounce around and
play a little bit in here. Just let it go, have fun, all kinds of little things happening, little actions. But today, I'm not going
to cover up the entire sky. I'm going to leave some
open spots here and there. Just let that brush bounce and play, all kinds of little things happening. Something like so. Okay, now while I've got
a little of that blue on the brush, I'm going
to go right down in here and sort of do the same basic thing. Just let the brush bounce
and play and have fun, and that's what you should
be doing, just enjoying, having fun. So painting should make you happy. There. Just drop in some little things,
but we leave some of these little white areas in here right now. Okay, now I'm going to clean the brush. Just scrub it off. Shake them dry. (flapping) Give them a good rap. It's a good way to take
out your frustrations. It's better than fighting
with your spouse or kicking the puppy dog around. Let's go right up in here and
let's just gently, gently, let's just blend this out. We don't want to kill all the light areas. And if this works just
right, it'll look like clouds and you didn't have to do anything except leave some areas open. Just a super nice, little
easy way to give an indication of little fluffy, distant
clouds without working yourself to death. And just let your brush
bounce around and play. Super little sky, easy to
do, only takes a minute. Okay, we'll do the same thing down here. Just very gently blend it out. Okay, let's have some
little hills back here in the background. So let's start, I'm going
to take a little bit of the Prussian blue, very small amount, a little Van Dyke Brown
and go just mix things on the brush here. Brown, blue, maybe even a
little Alizarin crimson, a little sap green all mixed on the brush. So we get brown, blue, crimson, sap green. There, okay? Let's go up to the canvas. Maybe there's a little
rolling hill back here in the background. So we touch and just pull down. Touch and pull down. See there, that's all there is to it. Very easy to do, make your little hill, wherever you want them to go. Pull straight down. Straight down, I'm just using
the very corner of the brush. There, maybe, maybe,
maybe it goes right on, right on off the canvas over there, wherever you want them to go. Now I'm going to add a little
bit of blue to my brush. And maybe there's is one even
farther back behind that one. Really probably should
have done that one first. I just want to show you how to make one that looks even farther away. More blue color, cause there's
water molecules in the air and things look below as
they're farther away from you. Okay, now then let's take... And we'll take a clean, dry
two and a half-inch brush and just tap. Just going to tap the bottom of these. Make them very soft and
misty, far, far away. Then lift upward. Just lift upward. And you could put as many
of these down as you want. As they get closer, you'd
be looking for a little more detail and you'd show a little more of the greenish color. As things get closer to
you, you begin making out more color, so we'd go more into the green and maybe we'll just put a little
on right here so you could have an idea. A little more into the green color. And however many you want. This is only limited by your imagination, how far you want to take it. There. That's a super nice way
of making little hills in the background. Tap the bottom. You need to mist them between. That mist is all that you
have to separate these. So you need this little misty area. And lift upward just like so. And once again, we have a
nice sort of little area in between them. Okay, maybe we have a few
little trees back here, and they're getting
closer, getting bigger. So we'll take some Van Dyke Brown. I'm going to use some burnt
umber, Alizarin crimson, sap green, just mix them
together on the brush. Pull that brush through the paint. See how it bends? Good. Now look at the shape of the brush. That's what you're looking
for, a lot of paint. Let me turn it around
so you can see the end. Ooh, look at all that paint. All right, let's go up to
the canvas and right in here maybe there he is, there's a little tree. Maybe he's a big tree
but he's far, far away and he lives right there, that's his home. A little more paint on the brush. Maybe right here there's another
one that lives right here. I don't want to kill all this misty area. It will really, once again,
that's all you have to separate all these individual things. Try not to kill them. Maybe there's just a little
tree that lives here. Wherever, wherever. And there's one. Maybe there's a big one right here. However you want them shaped,
that's the way you should be. Okay, just drop in some very,
very basic little shapes. At this point, we're really
not worried about it. We're going to need some
reflections if we're going to have a little pond here, and I think I will, so let's pull some of this down. At this point, still doesn't matter. We don't know where it's going
or why or don't really care. Okay, some of the more defined shapes, we'll work a little harder at like so. Okay, good. Pull that down and I'll take a clean brush and very lightly, very
lightly go across it. Just enough to give the illusion of water. Now we can start picking out
some individual things in here. Maybe we get a one-inch brush here. Tell you what, let's put a
little magic white on it, and let's go into a little bit of yellow. Yellow, yellow and my whole standby here, sap green. The magic white was in the
brush just to thin the paint. Now maybe right up here, we'll put some leaves on this little tree. Let some little shapes happen in there. There, it's all we need. I'll add a little more green. (mumbles) a little darker,
want to move right over here. And right here, oh there we are. And we'll put some leaves
in this little tree. Don't kill all your dark areas. Sometimes, when you start
putting these leaves on, they're such fun that you get carried away and consume all your dark
and then your painting is going to get very flat. Your little tree will just lay there. Look like somebody cut
it out of a newspaper and just stuck it on your canvas. We want trees that have depth
and have a little personality, okay? Now water normally lies
in a recessed area, so begin working with the lay of the land. So it comes down. I'm adding a little yellow
ocher, a little Indian yellow here and there. Just mix these on the brush. Let all kinds of little things happen. And we can reflect some of
this right into the water. Just look at what you have up here and reverse your brush
and do it in the water. Just very basic. Just reverse it, drop it in. Then with our large brush,
we take it very lightly, barely, barely touching, barely touching. Barely touching, pull it down. (flapping) And I do that just to remove
excess paint of the brush and very lightly come across. Sometimes you can just
beat the brush real hard and you don't have to go to
all the trouble of cleaning it. Okay. Tell you what, let's
build a little building or two back here. And maybe, I want to
start with a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. (scraping) A little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Cut a little bit out with a knife. Let's decide where our
first building will be. Maybe we'll have several
little buildings right here and go with the roof. We'll put the roof up, swoop, that easy. Give it another side of the roof, swoop. And all we do is fill in the color first. All I'm doing is just
putting in some brown and we'll come back and
highlight near the dark in order to show light. And maybe, maybe, maybe
there's a taller building right here. Just sort of lay in some
basic shapes right now for wherever we're going
to have the buildings. I'm really not worried about what they're going to look like. We're just laying in our brown color. And then we can play with it. Okay. Now let's put some things
up here on the roof. I'll take some brown, some white. (scraping) There, mix your color up. And I'm going to take a... Just pull across and get
a small roll of paint on the knife. There, you can see it very
well, just a small roll of paint right on the edge, okay? Now we can come right here
and we can begin adding some highlights. Now there's numerous
ways you can put this on to make all kinds of effects. You can just sort of let
it bounce along like this. Just let it tap, touch, bounce along, make it look old. Maybe we'll like a little
old, I like old buildings. And a little bit of highlight right there, a little light striking. A little bit off in that direction. Okay, now from the bushes,
it looks like the light is coming from the left. So let's take and make the
left side a little brighter. I'll take some burnt umber and put a small amount
of permanent red into it. Burnt umber with permanent red. A little bit of white. Okay, get a little roll of paint, let's go right up here and very lightly, just pull it down just to give the impression. Now to that same color, I'll
mix up some Van Dyke brown. So the same color, only I'm
using brown to make it darker. Same color, but brown added in. Much darker. Now put that, since the
light is coming from here, this side needs to be brighter. So right here, I'll use a
different color that's darker. Just like so. And that sort of separates them. Okay? Now you got to make some decisions. Are there windows in this building? If there are, I'll just use
the small edge of the knife and we'll just put some little indication. You can put wherever you want it here. This could be a barn or a house. Just want to show you how you can make all these little buildings. I'll just take the point
of the knife and sort of outline these little
windows, make them stand out. Okay, let's do the next one. (scraping) And we'll do the roof. Come right on down through that one. See there, we don't care. Just cut of what you don't want. There. Okay, now we'll take a lighter color. And once again, highlight
the edge so it stands out. A little bit right there. Maybe just a touch down there. Okay now, (scraping) now we can put a side here. That easy. And then our darker
color, put a front in it. Shoot, who knows? Maybe there's a big door
right there, big door. We don't know. I don't even know for sure
what kind of buildings these are. They're just cute. Maybe we can show some planks, just cut right through the paint. There we go. Trim up the edges like we want them. And maybe, let's get crazy. Maybe whoever built this
was having a good day, a good day and maybe he
put another little building that comes out this way. And there's a roof on it. We'll use the small edge of the knife, put the other side on. Got a little higher in
the front, there we are. Good. Other side of the building. A little bit of highlight. Make that stand out. I'm using the small edge of the knife. So often, we avoid that and it's just like the big
one, only it's smaller. Just super things, use it. Okay, now we need to put
some dark right here. Like that. And a little bit of the
lighter color in the front. There. Now we just got buildings everywhere. All righty. While I got this dark color on here, let's put some land in here,
we need a little bit of land right along, there it is. We have to make decisions
where it is, where it goes. And this is your world,
so you have to make these big decisions. Okay? So over in here. Now we're going to take
the brush I was using to make all these beautiful little bushes and let's just bring a few of these. See it's just a one edged
brush, still has cad yellow, but a bit of Indian yellow, yellow ocher, little permanent red all mixed together so you have a multitude of
colors happening on the brush. And we can bring all kind
of little grassy things all around, wherever you want them. Here and there and there and here. (scraping) And let's take a little brown and white and we'll make us a
little bit of highlight, just sparkle this up here and there. Don't want to be totally,
totally dead, okay? You know, one thing I'd like to mention while we're doing this, I
get a lot of letters asking about my easel. My easel, I designed
it and built it myself and it's made from a platform ladder. And it's very strong, very, very strong. And if you're going to paint this method, you need a strong easel. Nothing makes a better easel
for a more reasonable price than a step ladder or a platform ladder. Any kind of ladder works very, very well. Very well, Sometimes, we get carried away
here and we beat and bang. You need a strong easel. I'm going to use a little
bit of the magic white. Pull it out very flat, cut across it. And let's go up here and
just drop in some little water lines. Just here and there. There we go. (scraping) There. And you're just absolutely
cutting into the canvas. Just act like you're
trying to cut a hole in it. The canvas is tough, don't worry about it. They make tents out of it, it's strong. Chances are, you're not
going to cut a hole in it. You'd really have to, whew, you'd have to get violent
to cut a hole in it. I don't want to be around
if you're doing that. There we go, okay. We got some buildings and some water, let's work on that tree right there. It needs to have a little
something, a little leaf on it. So we'll use some greens, some yellow and we'll come right in
here and give him some happy little leaves. Okay. And maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe there's another one,
an individual that lives right there, right in these little foots. Okay, now we can reflect some
of that right into the water like we did on this side. Just here and there. Now with our large
brush, pull gently down. Very, very gently come across. Delicate, delicate touch. Now then, we can finish up the water lines and we'll have this side finished. Just here and there, drop in
a little happy water line. Okay, we can take a
clean point of the knife scrape in a few little
trunks here and there, wherever we want them. Make some... Or you can use your
liner brush if you'd like and draw them in using different colors. I'm lazy, I just take
the point of the knife and drop a few in and it looks good. Okay, now let's worry about
the other side of the painting. Maybe we'll have some land coming right down here in the front. So let's take this ol' big brush. We're going to take some
sap green, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin, a little Prussian blue. And let's go right in here, there it is. Maybe it comes right out through there. I don't want to kill water. I want it to go, look
like it's going on off in the background somewhere. Maybe there's a little
reflection right here. A little bit of reflection. Right there. And then we can bring this maybe right on around like that. Wherever, wherever you want it to go. Just drop it in. There's a bush right there. See. Okay, so we need to put
some color right there. Just a little happy
bush lives right there. Maybe, ooh, there's a nice red
one, bright little sparkler. Let's add a little green kind of right along in here. Make all kinds of little grassy areas. There they are. Okay, let's put some
land back in the back. A little bit of Van Dyke brown. Put a little bit of dirt right there. Gonna have something for all of this little grass and bushes to set on. There, a little bit of highlight on it. Then we can drop all
these things right there. And once again, mix these
colors on your brush That way, you get a
multitude of things happening when you hit the canvas. It's not just one dead color. And do this in layers
using the brush sideways. Touch, push, bend it upward. And the layers though, so it creates the illusion of depth. You don't want it to be flat. Now we need something
to push everything back in this painting, so I think
I'm going to take and add maybe a big tree that
comes all the way up, and that'll help push everything back and work on making it look deep. Right now, it looks quite flat. So let's go right in to some brown. We'll use the almighty knife and you got to make a decision. Where does your tree live? Where does he live? Right here is where he lives. There he goes. This is where we find out if you're brave, when you start putting
all this brown right up in a pretty blue sky. There he goes. Nice old tree. Well, he's (mumbles) goes
really up in the sky. Give him a foots. All the way up, there we are. Let him get a little wider,
make him look a little stronger. Okay, now we can highlight him. Maybe, tell you what. Let's give him a little friend. Don't want him to get lonely. It gets cold out here at
night, he needs a friend. Just let him go. Everybody needs a friend when it's cold. There. And let's drop in just a few
little indications of limbs. We'll put some leaves on
this one, so we don't really have to do a lot of work on the limbs. And if you have trouble
making the old knife work, you can do this with a liner brush. No problem, no problem. Works very well. Okay, now I'm going to
use the same reddish color that I used on the little
house back here and just touch. Now we said our light
is coming from the left. Please excuse my arm being
all in front of you there. This is where the left-handed
person has the advantage. And just go right on up the side there. And if I could just, just
make a few little highlights. And on the other side, I'm
going to put the least, least, least little touch of... A little bit of blue
there just to break it up. Now let's put some leaves on these trees. I said we'd have some leaves. Let them be very loose. Very, very loose. Let them go. Wherever, wherever you want them. Okay, now to highlight this,
I'll use a little yellow and very quickly, we'll highlight it. And as we're highlighting,
I'd like to tell you goodbye, and I hope to see you next week. This has been a fantastic painting, and I think it's taught you a lot. So in behalf of all of us here, I'd like to wish each and
everyone of you happy painting, God bless. (groovy instrumental music)
