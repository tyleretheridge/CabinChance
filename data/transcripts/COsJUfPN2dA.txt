hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today you really do a fantastic little painting let's start out and haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and let me tell you what I've already done up here I have my standard old canvas up here and I've covered it with a piece of contact paper with an oval cut out of the center now then I've painted that with black gesso onto the black gesso I want you just caught me in the act Errol is adding a mixture of alizarin crimson and phthalo blue in the center here I have more crimson and as it works out that I've added progressively more blue so that it gets darker toward the outside edges and I thought today would do a little scene that's very similar to one I did in the last series I had so many people write and they were so crazy about that little scene I thought I'd do another going to show you how you could just change it a little bit and vary it use the same idea to do another picture and I hope you enjoyed this one okay as I say I've already covered it with a mixture of alizarin crimson and phthalo blue and all you're looking for when you do this is just a nice stay an even coat you don't want big gobs of paint on here just just enough to cover the canvas as we mentioned before if you're going to paint for family or friends this is one of the neatest ideas because you can do this without your family or friends knowing that you put color on here already this is a transparent color so it still looks black and then tell you what we'll do it but when you start adding other colors on there son-of-a-gun adjust it just comes alive like oh it's like magic happening okay clean your brush beat it dry then we're in business I'm gonna dip this brush right into a touch of the liquid white now let's go right up in here and you have to make a decision right off in this painting where's our light source going to be I think it's going to be slightly off-center right about here so I'm just going to start with little crisscross strokes and look how that comes alive or just it just absolutely it shines beautiful start in the lightest area and work outward always working outward up there all the way up to the edges I try not to bring that dirty brush back into the center over here because if you do you're going to lose that beautiful pure bright color now you can make this any degree of lightness that you desire you can go over it and do it several times and each time it'll get a little bit lighter but each time you do it clean your brush be sure it's good and dry it will take just a small amount more the liquid white go right back into this light area and blend outward you can make this so bright it it'll almost hurt your eyes just depends on what you're looking for like so just blend it all together so it's very very smooth not lightly lightly just go across the entire sky this will move all the brushstrokes bring everything together all right okay let me clean the brush one more time that's the highlight of this painting is just cleaning the brush there we go and we're in business one more time now this is a mixture that I was coding the canvas width it's just a lizard and crimson and phthalo blue we just add some red onto the brush now initially I'm going to start in the center so I want much more crimson than blue I want this to be to the riddick side tap a little bit into the bristles let's go right up here now we have to start making some more big decisions where does our little bushes and trees live here just wherever you want them I will start at the base down here and work upward that way our darkest color will be here and it should get progressively lighter as we move upward into these little trees and bushes I want them to just barely stand out there very quiet soft subdued peaceful this is a very peaceful little painting tranquil whatever you want to call it now then start working backwards letting them overlap but I've added a little bit more of the darker color so that it stands out and here's a big old tree that lives right there wherever you want see I sort of think about the individual limbs and the shapes and drop them in over here I have one maybe he lives right there okay once again I'm getting a little darker continually adding more of the bluish color so as I work away from the center from the light area it gets darker darker Parker there there's one more in here we don't know I really don't know where they're at no we're doing it just tapping this color and that's predominantly to the blue side but tap but the brush sort of slide give it a little little tap right okay now then let's go right up in here maybe there's a big tree that hangs right over here this would let your imagination go here there okay we can wash this little brush one more time shake it off and just beat the devil out of it that's probably the highlight of painting just cleaning that brush you can take out all your hostilities and frustrations and if you're not careful you can redecorate your living room in a heartbeat I've taken paint thinner on the liner brush I want this to be thin like ink very very thin tournament brush and that will bring it to a nice sharp point a liner brush has very long bristles so it holds a lot of paint now we can go up in here and let's begin putting the indication here and there of all kinds of little trees and happy little things that live up in here wherever you think they should live see just a little little stick some twigs this is where all the little squirrels and the bunny rabbits play they have a good time good time I think I mentioned I have a little squirrel that lives with me and boy he eat something else he lives like a king he's got a big tall cage and we call a squirrel Hilton eats better than I do I spend all my money feeding creatures there's one okay right out through here over through there wherever you want but see how they just keep them by adding them it creates more and more depth and distance into your painting there and the same here is you work out to let him get darker and darker get more into the bluish color that that would come right on down like that there's his little arm gotta have a place up here fill all the little birds to set it's what all these little tree limbs are for they're just little seats for the birds and the last series in the last series we showed a little blue jay that I was raising and he's grown up now and he's taken off he's living he's living good now he's got a little condo in Miami stays there near in the winter to kids house payments vmw things are going well for him no it's not true that's not true just made it him we did turn him loose Loudoun and he's living close to Muncie India and he's having a good time hope he does have a family but now and maybe now he's got a bunch of little birds to feet and he knows how much trouble it is see the whole mess of limbs right in there that really looks like it's a big bunch of sticks there we are and in your world you decide how many little tree limbs or how few how many whatever and you just drop them in there's freedom on this canvas you can do anything that you like here anything that you like and you can create any kind of world that you want there we go there's enough old bad stuff going on the world here we make it very peaceful and nice let me get a one inch brush I want to put the indication of a little highlight here and there but I don't want much if you put too much we're going to lose that misty far away effect that we have there so I don't want too much I'm gonna take some titanium white I'll just pull some off with a brush here a little bit of this color that we had just tap so say I don't want a lot of paint on the bristles just enough we can go in here here and there but just the indication of some happy little leaves that are in there open here there's a few there see very subdued though I don't want something as a bright and yelling at you just this is quiet and Misty looking back in there as we get away from that light area I'll begin adding a little more of the color that had more of the blue in it more than okay maybe some right over in there there we go are you doing is tapping just tap so you can still see the tree branches and all the trunks and everything right through that paint there we go all kinds of little things living back here in the woods this with a little bunny rabbit hides these my friend I like you little bit up in here don't overdo though this starts working and gets so nice it's hard to stop it's hard to stop so just put a little in okay a little bit more to the blueish color as we get farther away from the light source there we go all kinds of little things happening back you're deep in the woods there and in your world you're painting make up little stories think about all the little creatures that live back here what they're doing and you know they have cares just like we do shoot they get problems I trying to chase one another around and everything makeup happiness stories for them it helps put you in the mood to paint all kinds of little things see I see all types of places back here we just be fantastic for the little creatures to hide this almost looks like something out of a fairy tale okay let's begin putting in some nice happy things right in the foreground won't add a little bit of that dark color to the brush just just want to get some blue on here so when I go down here to the yellow we'll get some nice green colors the Crimson lizard crimson and they look blue I'm looking for sort of a hunt off green color sort of a dirty green color just tap the bristles tap them right into that paint load a lot of color now then we have to make some big decisions here that's happen let's have some nice land area that comes right down like that there it is in darker darker darker as it goes back very dark back in here see that's continually picking up that color that's already on the canvas so the more you tap it the darker and the software becomes there we go a little bit on the other side over here maybe right in there what the heck wherever you want it let it blend slowly back slowly quietly there Oh yellow ocher here and there little endian yellow just what it makes all those colors everyone's going the least little touch of light weird with your color please little touch because if you have green you add red to it it turns a beautiful brown and we had believe it or not is your duller it dulls down the color I our little SAP green reach over and be able to separate them let's start getting darker as we get closer to the foreground darker darker I save here if you want to make it appear want to make it really zing like there's a little light shining through there all you gotta do is take the brush and go right into a little titanium white now watch when you hit right here see that little bit of white white sparkles see the sunlight hitting right there maybe the Zing's right through there bounces right along in here but it's easy to overdo it's easy to do too much so use that effect sparingly save it for the good spots save it for the good spots but that sunlight Nash isn't it's just ripping through they're having a good time there okay where it's a nice place to take your shoes off and just sort of run through there barefooted I grew up in Florida hiding wear shoes to school was like it or not as in about the sixth grade or our shoes to school because it was nice and warm and you denied to put on shoes there we go okay let's go over to the other side now and we put some nice grassy little areas over here too but just sort of think about the lay of the land here how you want it to flow the curds that you want in your land grab a little more the SAP green shape is quite important here I want this to sort of look like it comes down and each side now a little Valley like take up a little path in there what the heck that's a beautiful place to have a little path okay maybe maybe here in there brighten that a little bit for a little there a little brighter spot like his little light getting through on this side too don't want it all never say a little bit to zinging right through there see how you can Sparkle it it's unbelievable what you can do on this canvas you can do anything and anything it's your heart desires okay I'm just gonna wipe off the excess paint and sort of blend these edges right into nothing just wanted to blend right in there like so goes right up into the edge of the woods okay let's have us a little pat in there let me grab a fan brush now then let's just go into Van Dyck Brown Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna just mix them together on the brush mostly Van Dyck Brown though a little bit of each a lot of paint in the brush though okay now then think about maybe his little path this coming back through the woods and it sort of comes over the hill right here there it is there it is you knew it was there just sort of scrub this back and forth thank you the shape of the path as it gets closer and closer to you allow it to get bigger wider stronger so that it looks like it's really coming at you much bigger toward the front there later there we go and look at that already it gives you the impression it is sort of going back up over the hill there that's what we're looking for I'm gonna take a little a little bit of titanium white not much just put it on the same old dirty brush a little titanium white okay now then we'll go right up in here and just lightly just graze it just graze it so all you doing just enough to add a little touch of color here and there just graze it okay I've got several fan brushes going to me grab another one here with this one I'll go right into some yellow grab some SAP green there it is yellow ocher little Indian yellow maybe even touch the bright red hair there there now then I want to bring some new grassy things right down onto the path that helps push the path down into the painting so it doesn't just set up there all by itself this way it becomes part of the painting when you let a few little things hang over it just hearing there there we go there we go look at that just create all kinds of beautiful little effects over here's my cat my pick we're in business now there may be in our world here we have some nice big strong trees so let's take fan brush and we'll go right in - I've got number three fan brush right now but whatever size you happen to have available I just picked that up and I like it load it full of black midnight black a lot of color just both sides are full okay now you have to make a big decision where did you treat live I think maybe we have a tree right there see maybe he's got an arm let's make him a little fatter she we can stand out a little better there he is there he is now we'll give him an arm maybe there's an arm it lives right there soon maybe on the other side over here we'll have another tree looks like a good spot just in your world look at your painting and decide wherever you want a tree or a path or a stream say I'd make a beautiful stream through there to be easy to do you could still change it to a stream even at this point getting maybe maybe there's an arm on this tree that lives right out from there wherever we'll give him another one there let's get crazy how we get to yo maybe there's a big old tree lives over here big old tree alrighty so he's had a hard life we'll just let that old brush Bend didn't look at that see don't be afraid to bend that brush okay I'll give him a big arm it lives right here on the side maybe another one over here and you just sort of make a decision I don't where ever you want here in there you'll get another brush we'll take a little black little black little blue mix them together maybe here and there there's a bush or to put a little Bush lives right down here okay shoe test so much fun let's have one over here too there's a nice bush see that sort of Idol sort of bring everything together then I'm going to dip my brush into liquid white just to thin the paint I'm going into CAD yellow and SAP green load a lot of color to the bristles okay let's go up here and let's make this little bush right here just Sparkle a lot of paint so he sparkles don't kill all the dart King liquid white CAD yellow SAP green hmm but there's a lot of paint on the brush so all you do is barely touch if you have to push hard then you don't have enough paint or the paint that you have on the brush is too thick remember our golden rule then paint will stick to a thick paint there we go now we just take the knife in here and there scrape in the indication of a stick twig all those things one over here kitty while we have the knife going let's take let's take some white some bright red little dark sienna put it all together without flap now just cut us off a little roll of paint let's go up in here put the indication here and there I have a little highlight on some of these little trees just where you think a light with zip through there and hit just a little and highlight who this little bit tree boy he's had a rough life maybe he's a little uh big bear something came along here and stepped on him but a little heard it really cooked him all up he's all gnarly some all the little things on and we take some blue and white mostly blue though very little white what is very dark just make the indication of a little reflected light right there okay go over on the other side and let's put a little touch right along here like so so bit right there and there wherever a little bit of our blue there we go I'm going back to my script liner brush dip it in a paint thinner right into a little bit of black and let's just put in an indication here and there I have a few little limbs and branches be sure your paint is very thin if it's thin it'll flow you have trouble making it flow chances are your paint is too thick very thin now then look over to this one don't want him left out this is where if you have a little twitch in your hand well it's good for making all these branches that really pays off ya know one of the questions I'm asked over and over is what we do with all these paintings that are left from the shows because there's a lot of paintings I started 200 shows now we donate these paintings to PBS stations around the country and other charity organization but mostly the PBS stations they auction them off and make a happy bucks off if you'd like to have one get in touch with your station let them know timber to get one there and when they have their auction support them help them out they need your help there we go I'm gonna take a little crimson a little black let's just put the indication the silhouette here and there of some little leaves out here there we go like so little on this one and we've bout got a finish painting this one will certainly certainly give you some experience and if you've never painted before this is a good one for your first attempt now let's take two let's take this off and let you see what it looks like remove the contact paper and look at that son of a gun we can take a little bit of red and we'll sign it I really hope you've enjoyed this one as I say if you've never painted before this is one that you can do in your first attempt I thank you for joining me I hope you enjoyed it and from all of us here happy painting and God bless Oh Oh Oh you
