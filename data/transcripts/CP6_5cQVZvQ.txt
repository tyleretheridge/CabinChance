welcome back I'm glad you could join me today and today we're gonna do something very different and I think you'll really enjoy it so let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting they'll come across in exactly the same order that I have them on the palette starting with the white and working around while they're doing that come on up here to the canvas let me show you something think you'll like this today I have a canvas same size as always use 18 by 24 but I've taken contact paper and put around the entire canvas except for an oval right here in the center it's just plain old contact paper that you buy at your local drugstore or hardware store whatever right over the canvas and then we're going to paint them beautiful little painting in here and have some fun so let's do it let's do it tell you what I'm gonna start out today with a little bit of the bright red and then I'm going to go right up into a little touch of titanium white a little more of the red so I'll make a nice pinkish color okay let's go ahead up here and I'm just gonna put in a little tiny pink glow right there just using little crisscross strokes just right across there okay now without cleaning the brush I'm going into a small amount of phthalo blue small amount it's very strong very very strong and it right underneath the pink a little tiny bit of just like it this will be a very soft and very effective painting beautiful to the painting I think you're really gonna enjoy it I'm I'm so excited about this one okay now without cleaning the brush I'm going into the least little touch of phthalo green let me say that again the least little touch well it's tough strong it'll eat up your whole world in just a heartbeat okay let's go right up here now then I'm gonna have some water in this painting so I'm going to pull this right across just like this and water unless it's moving is a level so try to keep these strokes as straight as possible there try to keep it straight you don't want your water to to run out of your pain and get your floor with you'll be medic now leave a little area in here that's unpainted that'll end up being very pretty I have several brushes guys I don't have to clean them okay now right here or this balloon paint go together I'm just gonna blend this to us a nice and soft so you can't tell where one color stops and the next one starts look at that and then very lightly just take the brush strokes out down here in the water all the way across yeah smooth and gentle it isn't but your little light area right there still remains okay let's have some fun now now then let's get dangerous I won't go into the midnight black just a little of it on the fan brush let's go right up here now then I want some contrast in this guy so I'm gonna take this and just dance it around let it play just let it go whoo look at that out of it and I bet you're upset with me now just let all kinds of little things happen this is just midnight black bagel cloud lives right up here look at that just let it play a little more the paint maybe they've got a long finger that comes right out through there now when you're doing yours you put clouds wherever you want don't try to just copy what we have here hey everybody sees nature differently there all right yeah then take a nice dry brush be sure your brush is dry if it's wet at this point you're gonna become a mud mixer and you're gonna be upset with me tiny tiny little circles and just begin very lightly very lightly blending this yes blend it little tiny circles and I'm just using just the corner of the brush just the top corner of the brush very very small little circles there we go they have it with a clean fan brush I'm gonna go back pick up a little bit more of my pink that was a bright red a titanium white all right now back up here now I'm going to just let some of this bounce right over this dark color just push it in get tough with it get tough just let it bounce and play look at there wherever you think it should be that's where it should be and once again with our large brush very gently just barely barely grazing the canvas this is three hairs and some air just caress it just caress it if this is your good friend you don't want to hurt it just want to caress it very gently very gently just take the brush strokes out and that easy you have one fantastic sky in a pretty think you're really enjoy doing that one okay today let's take the old round brush and I'm gonna go right into a little bit of the dark Sienna a little Van Dyck Brown a little SAP green just mix them on the brush here tap see you're really tapping that brush just go up here now then maybe there's some happy little trees good live yep right there you're right you were right there he is these are just little background things they live back here wherever you want them in your world oh there's a nice way there's a nice when he just he got a little extra sunlight through big straw a little more the color and whatever you want and that quick we have some nice little background trees and then we'll just take a knife I'm just using the small one but they eat it won't work just take and just scratch in a few little stick and twig indications here or you can take your liner brush and paint it man I find it a little faster just to drop them into the night there we go all right add it same old dirty brush now we'll go right into the yellows this is a little bit of yellow ochre little CAD yellow she will take a little Indian yellow and some SAP green and we just mix them right on the brush my yellows are a little bit thinner than my other paints so they mix easier okay let's go right up here now then let's put some highlights on some of these and I'm just taking the top corner of the brush and all I'm doing is just barely touching just barely touching see and make little forms and shapes in there Jimmy just like that look at that look at that just drop it in all kinds of little things but I'm happening vadoma happen remember there's layers back here there's not just one will Bush living back here there's layers and that's what helps create the illusion of depth distance in your painting at least little touch of the red put a nice red one right there that will really stand out hurting the level okay little color on that and just sort of work these yellows and reds back and forth just to create whatever effect that you want remember this is your world and you can do anything it makes you happy on here and you'll thing in that quick you have a very very nice effective little background now then let's begin working forward on this and putting some more distance into it I'm gonna go right into these Browns at a head same color I made the trees with little dark cyan a little Van Dyck Brown okay let's put in some base color here and all I'm going to do is just tap begin thinking about the lay of the land how do you want your land to flow I wanted to sort of come down like this like so sounds like yeah all right you know it's hard for me to believe with the completion of this series we'll have over 100 half-hour shows that's almost unreal to me it's fantastic fantastic now I'm going to pull down a little bit that color and this will end up being reflections just pull it straight down straight down I can look at there see instant reflexes very lightly go across just go right across ya then take another old brush here same size it's two inch brush we're going to a little green little yellow and I'm just gonna tap some of these colors on here same colors we use to highlight the trees in the back okay let's go right up here now that begin at the most distant area and start working forward all we're doing so I'll do that real slow so you can see it and just tap and you work in the layers work in layers okay here comes another layer and let it follow through just like bowling so you let it follow through there just let it come right on down layer after layer after layer however many layers that you want wherever you want it to go see they're that easy creates the illusion of land back here in painting is just games of illusions that's really all it is okay now let's take the knife take a little bit of brown and back in here we'll put the indication of a little bit of dirt got to have something for all these little things to level just a little brown this is a little Van Dyke just rubbing it off and I'll take a little brown and white same color just brown white and add the least little touch of highlight here and there don't overdo just a little that's super a little bit of the liquid white cut across it and we'll put a happy little water line back here not too much this is done with a very firm pressure you're really cutting into the canvas just get tough with it just get tough keep these lines basically straight you don't want your water to run right out of your painting okay I'll add a little bit more the Browns here let's go right here so you just keep making decision to build plane after plane as many planes as you want in the world complete the area it's a father's two way first and work forward a few little happy reflections just by pulling straight down going across very light just whisper light I have two brushes going here so I don't have to clean them each time go back into my brush it has the yellows on it tap a little color a little bit of the bright red on there there we go let's go up here oh that's pretty just all kinds of little things there if you want one to stand out add a little brighter color to it look at that see that little a little hill now stands out from all the rest people will make out and stand out a little more - okay we need a little bit of ground area underneath this one don't want it to get get upset because it didn't have any okay a little bit of the brown and white highlight color just barely touch barely touch then I'll just tap a little coloring that'll bring all that together MJ that's such a pretty little area shooteth if I was there I'd have to have a little cabin right there let's do that let's go right into some Van Dyck Brown and right here right here let's start with a back eve just drop that in to the other side of the roof that easy make a little throne on this little rascal both sides they decide don't want that to fall off I could have put aside on him and then let's just take a little bit of the brown right here it will just put a little highlight on the roof this is an old cabin I like to do old buildings if you painted with me before you know that I like these whole buildings take a little bit of light color light brown right there and just how'd I did a little touch so it stands out a little bit of highlight on the board's just - that's all you got to do so are you gonna do I'm just gonna take the pointed knife and cut through and make the indication of little boards I tell you what let's get the small knife the small knife gets in these little places like better this guy's like me he ran out of storage space and he built a little shed right there see it that easy you got a happy little make a little highlight on the top of the shed it's got a little roof on it - SOI been leaked there there we go little bit of highlight on that area and I keep this right in here very dark very dark because not much lights gonna hit in there this put a let's put a little door right there we need a way to get in and out of this nice little cabin little touch a lighter I'm still using a small knife okay I will take a little tiny bit of blue and white and put the indication maybe there's a little window right here I will put one right there just the least little hint of blue okay yeah let's take a fan brush we will use some yellows and some greens all right let's go out up here now then we can just pop in some happy little bushes and this cleans up - at the bottom of the cabin just cleans it all up and this guy's like he didn't cut his lawn very well and it's growing up around a rounded edge of his house so let's learn a little weeds grow it up around his house maybe we can take the little knife here put the indication of a little tiny path right there just a little indication all right then we got a little cabin got a little cabin I'm gonna put some water lines right into here use a little bit of liquid right just like it all right unit a this was a fun little painting I knew you'd enjoy it I knew you'd enjoy I'm gonna use some of the browns and greens again okay let's go right up here maybe there's a big old tree and he lives yep you're right he knows her right there and he hangs right out there that's what I used to do when I was a kid I just would hang out that's what this trees doing it's just sort of hanging out here having a good time there we go he comes right on down here all kind of little bushes are happening there they go oh look at there now the little Peninsula comes right out here just sort of let these things happen don't don't try to plan everything that'll happen let him happen that's when it becomes fun okay now very lightly we'll pull a little touch of that down like so and that'll as we know when end up being reflections pull it down very lightly cross very lightly now then I need some land so we all we just dropped to land in now there we go little bit of the brown white maybe throw a least little touch of blue in it at all now give it a sort of a gray color I don't overmix your color don't over mix it that all these things just sort of happen alright I'm gonna take a little liquid white on my liner brush and maybe over here there's a tree trunk you sort of a light color see they turn that brush it makes all kinds of little things just happen makes it a little more interesting in just a straight old tree trunk give it a little turn little wiggle all cats are pretty things and wherever you want to maybe there's one yep that's right there now then and then we can we can put some highlights on that tree we'll take some of the yellow little SAP green load is two inch brush full of paint really loaded full J let's go right up here now then you don't want to cover all the dark see just highlight these and if your paint is too thick again won't stick add a tiny tiny little bit of the liquid white or paint thinner either one this is sticking very well but if you're having trouble that's the way you make it stick you start with a very thick base color very thick paint and then you can add layers of thinner paint right over the top of it you look at all those little leaves happening there see and think about patterns here think about there's limbs that create these little stacks don't just don't just throw a bin down here we got some happy little bushes that live look at all there there there is one wherever you want I had a little bit of the red will get bright red oh nice one nice one sometime some of these colors happen it makes me excited just they just jump right out there on you now with just a clean knife they can create the illusion of a finger little sticks and twigs wherever you want a little bit of liquid height hey put a water line right into this see I cleans up the bottom and sort of separates everything look at there a few little ripples on the water keep those straight also most important most important I tell you what let's have some fun now watch right here let's bring the camera right up in here I want you to see this very close okay come right up here all right watch now let's take the contact paper off look at that look at that they'd left fantastic I told you you'd like that told you you'd like that now then let's really have some fun already doesn't make a beautiful little painting that lives a tree right here big tree iron no there's a big tree right here still using just the brown even going to go into a little bit of the blue and a little bit of crimson there and I want this to sort of come right on a raft what makes this interesting is that it breaks the borders breaks the waters just sort of let this sort of float around wherever you want it to go hmm if you interested in selling paintings this one but this one will load your wallet up this is it all these colors are all I'm doing is putting a dark base color in here so we can we can come back and put some highlights on maybe yep look at there see if there's a little projection comes right out there and you can make as many of these little projections little peninsulas as you want in your painting and they help create the illusion of depth distance I know you hear me say that over and over but to me it's very important to have paintings that have depth them don't like paintings that are flat very lightly go across yeah maybe we'll just bring us write them down I know I said it come wheeling over here why not now when you're doing this you let it go wherever you want it very lightly very lightly but in that exciting when you pull that contact paper off it and there it sets I think that's one of the most beautiful little paintings we've ever done in any of the series it just it just makes you feel good okay I'm gonna get a fan brush here I'll go right into some of the Browns okay let's go up here let's put a happy little tree trunk right there right Kyle give my little friend trees get lonely they need friends take a little bit of brown height touch of the rib touch the red white so strong yeah Ali let's just take the knife just drop in some nice little highlights here and there she has to make out old tree stand right out look at that just pops him right out - hmm okay Mandan I'm gonna take the ladder brush a little bit of liquid black coating and just put the indication here and there hope you can see those it's quite dark they'll have some come right on out here see they're just it's a nice little nice little limbs there they come wherever you want them there there's one over there see just as many of most views you want you take a little bit of the liquid white very lightly highlight them make them stand out like so okay back to the knife I'm gonna put a little land right here just I let it come right around when it make it look like a disorder sort of goes around a corner yep a little bit of the brown and white highlight yeah got a bit of liquid white don't cut us in a nice little orderly right now then let's go back to our 2 inch brush it has the color on it and let's begin putting in some little highlights all we're doing here just barely tapping the yellows and the Greens see don't kill all your darks I know you get tired of hearing me say that but it is so important if you kill all those darks then you're gonna lose your depth in your tree no that is it see that dark makes that really stand out and as I said earlier if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little bit of liquid white or a little bit of thinner either one the liquid white will make your color a little lighter if you use thinner the color remains the same but the paint gets thinner so that's why they call it dinner huh all right you didn't think I knew that there okay now once again here you're working in layers create one layer tab and work forward forward forward forward it's most most important that you do that you create the illusion of little bushes and little trees and all these little happy things let alone this color just wander right on over here we don't know where it goes I really really hope you've enjoyed this painting as much as I've enjoyed bringing it to you this was something I worked on for quite a while and I've been waiting to show it to you because I knew you'd be excited about it I'll tell you what I think we're about ready to sign that one take a little bit of the bright red on the liner brush let's go right here well sign this one call it finished and once again I really hope you've enjoyed this one it's been a great pleasure bringing it to you and so from all of us here until next time happy painting got ha
