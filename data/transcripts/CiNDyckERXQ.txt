hello I'm glad to see you today I'm certainly glad you could join me I thought today we'd do a fantastic little painting that I really believe you'll enjoy so let's start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and they'll come across as usual in the same orders I have them on the palette starting with a white and working around let's go on up here and let me tell you what I've done I have a canvas here this painted black as you can see now we use a black gesso to paint this black on top of that I've allowed the black to dry of course on top of the black then I've put some Indian yellow here a little bit of alizarin crimson and then some phthalo blue and down here I've just put a little bit of Van Dyke Brown around the edges I thought we'd do a pretty little scene today I really believe you'll enjoy so let's start out I'm going to take the old two-inch brush and go right into a little bit of titanium white just plain old titanium white just put some in the bristles like so okay let's go right up here now today right off you have to make a big decision basically where is the horizon going to be that's the first decision so let's let's say it's going to be right in here so let's just start making little criss-cross strokes and there look at what's happening so it picks up all those beautiful yellow colors underneath and as it works up we're going to get into the gonna get into the alizarin crimson hmmm I love use black canvases so fantastic we'll just keep working right on that okay now that as you as you run out of white paint on your brush clean your brush we just scrub it off in the old bucket here give it a good shake and beat the devil out of it now I'm going right back in here and put a little bit more of the titanium white I want to brighten this up south so always start with a clean brush in the light area and work upward upward upward upward okay now I'm just adding a little more white allowing some of this blue to be picked up to the Crimson's and all the beautiful little colors it's a fantastic way to make a healthy little sky there we go now when you're preparing your canvas as I mentioned earlier it's covered with black gesso and you can use a black latex but latex is not designed to hold paint so be careful with that it'll work in a pinch but if you have an option use a product that's designed specifically for making canvases black now then with our nice clean brush we can just go back and blend all this together mmm hope you got your sunglasses on today that's one walls guy just want to keep blending till you can't tell where one color stops and the next one starts bring it together very smooth not like so and very lightly go over to take out all the brushstrokes and you got a happy little sky that quick that quick okay let's have some fun today we'll to use the old dual round brush and we'll go right into some Van Dyck Brown and dark Sienna and just tap the brush just firmly tap it just like so there we go just go right up here now then I want to have some some little trees and stuff in the background here so take the round brush and just tap in some basic shapes just a very basic shape you're not really worried about much at this point look at that this whole round brush does some super thanks there we go just all kinds of happy little trees hmm a little more paint on the brush and there comes one all right maybe maybe right here let's have a big strong tree he lives right here there you can just absolutely go crazy with this take all kinds of trees we've got to have a place for the birds to set I introduced you to my little bird earlier in in this series okay it gives us a some basic shapes for all of our little shrubbery bushes and trees all those little good things now then I tell you what let's use a script liner brush and I'll dip it right into some paint thinner it will go into some of the brown now you want this paint to be as thin as water ink consistency and turn the brush that loads it turn it and pull it out see how sharp it is turn it pull it out a liner brush has very long bristles it'll come to a fantastic point let's go right up here and then let's just put the indication of some happy little tree trunks in here just here in there got to have something to hold up all this all these trees and shrubbery there maybe maybe maybe there's maybe there's one that comes we all not like yes wherever you make the decision here's one over this one looks like he sort of bent to me I like old trees etre leaning over to have some character there we go and you can put as many or as few branches as you want in your tree just lay em oh if you have trouble making the paint making the paint come off the brush add a little more paint thinner remember our golden rule then paint will stick to a thick paint painting over in here we don't want this tree to be left out let's give let's give him a happy little trunk there he is but you see how easy it is to make a fantastic sky already and once you once you put these little trees in then it pushes everything back it just how it makes it come alive now then let's take the same or round brush I haven't cleaned it still dirty and we'll go into some of the yellows and I'm just going to tap into yellow little yellow ochre just tap it and get quite a bit of paint on the brush see how I'm tapping do it slow so you can see there but a lot of paint okay let's go up here now then with just the top corner of the brush let's go in here and begin adding all kinds of little little bright shiny leaves on here all I'm doing is just touching but worried about shape add a little little the bright red to that let's make one right look there mmm doesn't that one stand out nice but all you doing is just tapping with the top corner and as you go down down down let it get darker darker darker darker darker okay let's go right up here I'll go to this old big tree give him give him some little happy things going on don't any be left out look at that look at that and fantastic and you could do it and then there we go so you know when you when you're doing these trees don't don't kill all the little dark areas leave some of these dark hair you see in here I use that as a pointer the dark areas are as important as the light areas don't kill them all that's what gives you tree character and then we work forward working layers completing the most distant thing first and then coming forward so you know that one will push everything else back sticky here and that's the way you build depth in your painting and don't make them all the same sheet summit all some short some are skinny some are fact just like people each one has their own individual personality there we go can let's go over here on the other side drop in a few on this little tree with all on him left out either there again and when you're painting trees devote some time to studying what a tree looks like go out and go out and talk to a tree make friends with it it's been some time looking at trees see what makes them see what makes them work why do they look the way they look but you got a tree in your front yard probably that you you've looked at for a hundred years and never paid any attention to get your big glass iced tea and go out one day and set in the yard in' just look at how beautiful it is nature so fantastic you just just devote a little bit of time to studying looking at it make friends with it there we go let's go right up in here put some this tree but all we're touching is a top corner of the brush just a very top corner so you get all those beautiful little individual things be careful that you don't let the brush slide if it slides and you're going to be unhappy with me I want you to be unhappy you're just just tapping but no sliding that's very important and then let's come right down here there's another little rascal he's just singing in the Sun out here and just cover up your whole canvas with layer after layer bushes if you want and it's okay that's a super super way to practice but let's have some fun in here maybe maybe we will take just some plain old titanium white here on the fan brush load it quiet for go ahead fall can let's go right up in here now then maybe there's snow on the ground here in with all these little bushes I want to do that because it looks pretty just begin forming the lay of the land see very gently and allow it to pick up that color it's underneath so it reflects right out of the sky and you can just see make all kinds of little hills and valleys in here and very lightly just blend it all together and you can push everything back in like layer after layer after layer just just by blending it a little there we go maybe over here comes right down just wherever you want it it's up to you there we go not a super easy way to make some happy little ground areas okay maybe over in here we just bring this right on back what the heck we don't have to make any big decisions yet something like so I tell you what if you paint with me before you know me and and water I'm a water fanatic so I take a little bit of white on the two-inch brush and let's say there's a little bit of water right here so I'm going to touch and just pull straight down straight down here I'm using a very very firm pressure get tough with it mm-hmm pull them down like so okay okay white say easy this to make water be sure these lines come straight down there I had a little bit of color I want this to be bright all right now then gently gently go across just enough to give it sort of a sheen like so okay now then let's come back with the old fan brush and we can begin doing little individual things here watch right here just that easy just bring it right over the little little doer right there and maybe there's one that lives here and this one comes right on now just like so see just as many or as few as you want and we can begin putting all kinds of little things that live out here can you here we go tell you what let's go over here and you build layer after layer after layer and that once again I know you get tired of hearing me say it but that helps create the illusion of depth distance in your painting and then we'll take a a little touch of the liquid white pull it out very flat let me clean the knife maybe we can get a close-up here and you can see how to load this knife pull it out as flat as you can get it and then cut across see over that flat and then cut across it's that easy okay let's go ahead up here now all you do is go right in here and just we'll just cut in a little water line just cut it in there we go like so maybe a little bit right in there that's super all right I have to make some big decisions tell you what let's do let's have this come right down over mmm there and we can just fill all this up I have a touch of it they little blue right there I'm gonna put some shadows in this just a little tiny bit then we take put the white right over my so my blue limb even add a little touch of alizarin crimson I want some of that sky color to reflect through there oh we're doing right now is just laying in some base color now we'll come back and very gently very gently begin laying white right on top of that this is just straight to titanium white plane oh boy all right there we go and then a super weight just to drop in a happy little snowbank and you can do it you can hang it right here do you ever think you'd get a painting this bright off of black canvas you can you really can there we go straighten up the edges all right smooth this out of here a little a little bit of the phthalo blue up here - one free little shadow in there it's a little bit darker over in here better white see there you just keep changing your mind any time what you want to hear we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents you learn to work with anything that happens there we go hmm that's coming right along tell you what tell you what let's have some fun this will round brushes so much fun let's just play with it I'm go right into the browns again just tap just tap it maybe maybe over here in this corner yep I see a great big tree why he's a big when he goes clean off the canvas up here there you just sort of visualize these things in your mind and drop them on the canvas it's your your creation you can do anything that you want to do here and anything will just come right on down here like so nothing would take take the fan brush and load it full of the Van Dyck Brown and dark sienna we just mix them together right on the brush say load the brush full of color both sides okay let's go right up here and then let's put a happy little tree trunk and I just soon as you pull down apply more pressure so it gets larger and larger larger and larger toward the bottom tell you what maybe maybe maybe maybe you're right yeah right there alright we'll put on another one shoot we just got all kinds of happy little trees and take the knife some white and some of that same brown color I'm going to add at least little touch of the bright red to it just to give it some mmm sparkle it up about like it cut off a little roll of paint just a very small roll let's go up here now then right along the edges here I just want to put the indication of a few highlights just make that little tree stand right out then we'll give this one some don't have left out there he is various that easy and all I'm doing is just touching the canvas I can just pull off what it wants and give you back what's left and just like a taxman does every year there we go just right on up the tree okay and on the sticker a liner brush paint thinner and you want this paint to be very very thin I can't say that enough it won't flow unless it's almost the consistency of ink all right let's just go right in here just drop into indication of a few happy little tree branches here and there just here and there wherever you think they should be that's exactly where they should be when you do this just relax kick back enjoy it should make you happy should make you very happy when you paint paintings one of those good things there if painting teaches you nothing else nothing else at all it will teach you to see what teach you to see things in nature that you've never knew existed before you you'll become aware of shape of color oh my gosh it opens a whole new world to you a whole new world and when you drive down the streets you'll see you'll see coloring trees and and form be careful you'll wreck the car sometime looking I get I get so crazy I just don't pay attention to where I'm going and on that travel I carry a camera with me and with the camera then you can take pictures of things and save it for later times when you want to paint and you can come back and take ideas off that painting that you did or picture that you did and do a beautiful painting I'm just taking a little bit of the brown here and tapping in some just little indications of some happy little leaves this is just a dark so we put some light on it'll show which is some dark color okay I have two round brushes going here so I don't have to go back and forth and wash them so much okay and now we'll go back in here we just just with a little bit of yellow tap on some indications of some happy little leaves that are living up here this round brush is fantastic you can do entire paintings with it you can do entire paint makes beautiful clouds super bushes there we go don't overdo here want to keep this quite dark this is more in the shadow areas like so okay now then with our fan burst that has the white on it we can go back in here and let's just clean up the foots down here and allow a little that brown color to be picked up there we go now let's have some fight wheel takes the fan brush with some brown on it we'll just pop in a few little your little grassy things that are living down here wherever you want them maybe there's one that lives here look at there it's just wherever sort of breaks up that expanse of white then with our breasts it has the white on it we can smooth up the edges and sort of bring this all together they're wherever you wanted to go I tell you what you know me I got a couple minutes left here so let's have some fun I think yep I think it's a big tree he comes we here and lives down here about putting this tree in does two things and it drives my director crazy that's first but the second thing is it pushes everything back and gives much more perspective to the painting there we go hmm all right vector paint thinner on the liner brush and let's put in just indication of a little tree trunk or two here just hearing they're like so there is some once again this paint should be as thin as ink then is ink if it won't flow then add a little bit more of the paint thinner to it there with our knife this little tree needs to touch a highlight on it just a little just enough to make him stand out just about tapping you can fade it right on back into nothing well I have that damn paint on here I'm going to drop in a few little sticks and twigs here and there just a couple to break that up and bring it bring it all together okay let's put the indication of a happy little leaf or two on this tree don't him to be left out that like so just a couple little bit of yellow and we can highlight him and a fantastic way though to make a super little painting I really hope you've enjoyed this one they give you a lot of experience with a round brush a lot of fun let's certainly certainly hope you try it I think the sign that one take a little bit of red sign it right here and with that we'll call this painting finished once again certainly hope you've enjoyed it I look forward to seeing you next time until then happy painting god bless you
