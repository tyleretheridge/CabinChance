(relaxing music) - Welcome back. Well, today I have a
special treat for you. You know in the first show, I told you I was gonna
bring some friends in and let them show you some
fantastic painting methods also. And today, I have a lady that
comes right out at California and she's gonna show you how to do, oh, the most fantastic
seascapes you've ever seen. So, I'd like to introduce you today to my friend, Joyce Ortner. Joyce, we're glad to have you with us. Thanks for coming. - Oh, Bob, thanks so much for inviting me. I hope everyone enjoys
painting a seascape today. - Well, very good. I'm gonna get off the set
here and let you have it, and I'll see you at the end of the show. - All right. Okay, we're going to do
a basic seascape today and it's a painting I call
the Anatomy of a Wave. What I'm going to do is take a large brush and I’m going to deep it in a medium. Now this medium is a
mixture of linseed oil, paint thinner, and high
gloss urethane varnish. Damar varnish dries too fast for me because I do a lot of blending so, I find that the high
glass urethane works better. So remember that's equal
parts, one-third, one-third, linseed oil, paint thinner, and varnish. So I'm dipping my large
brush into the medium. Maybe I better start off
by telling you the colors. The two colors I'm using
today are right here is white, cad yellow medium, thalo blue, alizarin crimson, and thalo green. Now, I’ve taken and made a
mixture of equal parts of alizarin crimson and
thalo green right there and I've made that a perfect black. And you can test your
color by adding white to it in a pile here, and you want to achieve a perfect gray. Now, if you have too much red you'll have to add more green, or if it's too green,
you'll have to add more red. Now this is a wonderful color because that color will
help you control the strong thalo colors that you've
got on your palette today. All right, I'm gonna deep
my brush in the medium, go in to my white, pick up some thalo blue, and I'm gonna start right in on my sky. You’ll notice I have a
piece of masking tape stretched across my canvas, now that would be my horizon line. Notice, it is not at the center or either does it divide
my canvas into thirds, but it's almost in between
being one-third and one-half up. Now, I've marked this at
seven-and-a-half inches, this is an 18 by 24-inch canvas. The top of my tape is
seven-and-a-half inches down from the top. Now, that's going to be the
horizon line of my ocean which we always want it
to be perfectly straight. All right, I've got my
thalo blue and white on my brush and I'm doing in the X stroke, get's that paint really into those, the weave of your canvas. Now, you can relax and
really enjoy this painting because it's a lot of fun and
you can really learn a lot because it's gonna teach you how the motion of the water works. Now, the top of our sky
is going to be darker then the rest, and will get lighter as we get towards the bottom of the sky. I'm going to pick up more white. I think that this X stroke I'm using is probably my basic stroke. You'll notice throughout the painting I really use it a great deal. Now, to get further down on my canvas almost to the horizon, I'm
going to pick up white, go into my alizarin crimson so
I get a very soft pink color. All right, I want that to be
right on top of that tape. Notice, I paint right on the tape. I'm gonna go in all the way across my
canvass right on the horizon. Little more medium, little more white, little more pink. Remember, anyone can paint. It just takes a little
practice, a few simple tools and maybe somebody to get you started. And it takes a lot of paper
towels or rags I find. Back into my medium, I think I'll put a little more
color on the sky at the top, more thalo blue, and white. Again, I'll go over the
colors on the palette, they're white, cadmium yellow, thalo blue, alizarin crimson, and thalo green. All right. This is what you call blending. I'm going to really merge these colors that I've got on my sky so that it's a very subtle graduation from the blues into the pinks, which makes a lavender
transition right there. We know that if we take
alizarin crimson and thalo blue, and white, we're gonna
get a soft lavender here. Okay, we'll gonna leave
this a really simple sky. If we have time, we'll
go back and put clouds if we want them but, right
now, we'll keep it simple, and the most fun part I
think is taking out the tape. See, that gives me a straight horizon and that is a hard trick
to keep a straight horizon so, I think you find that masking tape works really, really good. I've mixed another color
here on my palette. This color is white with thalo
blue and alizarin crimson. Now, I've made a lavender out of that. A little bit to the blue side,
you don't make it too pink. Now, this is the color that
we'll put on our horizon. Again, I'm going to go into my medium and pick up some of that
blue lavender color I've got. Now, that's the color I'm
going to use across my horizon I've got a good amount of
paint loaded into my brush, I've got an edge groomed into my brush, so that I can go right on that edge and I'll do vertical strokes. It's worth taking the time to do this way because it keeps your horizon straight. If you ever get it crooked, you'll know what a fight it can be. But remember, you can't make any mistakes you can't fix, so we don't have to worry
if we do make a mistake. That's the joy of painting with oils, they're very, very forgiving. All right, I'm gonna go all the way across my horizon this way with a mixture of alizarin
crimson, thalo blue, and white, and it's a little more blue
than it is to the pink. I don't know if you've ever
painted seascape before but there are lots of fun and
that's what I paint the most. I live right by the ocean in California and it's really beautiful. I've got a little bit
dibby-doo on my horizon, but we can fix it, right? We can't make any mistakes we can't fix. Okay, I'm gonna need
to load my brush again a little more medium, more lavender color. Now, this part of the painting
is really underpainting. Now, I can use my horizontal stroke that I've got my paint laid down there. Now, I'll go back pretty
soon and soften that horizon but right now, I'll leave it. Now, the next thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to put in what I call the baseline of a wave. Now, this is really important to think, this will help you with
your seascapes a lot. I’m dipping my brush into
medium and I'm picking up that very, very black color that I mixed, half thalo green, and
half alizarin crimson. Now, this line is going to
be straight but at an angle. I'm going to have it
start right about here. And notice the angle, it's dipping down, this adds interest. We don't want everything
to go straight across in this painting, we wanna have a little bit of an angle on this. Now, that is the baseline of the wave. Now remember, this painting is called the Anatomy of a Wave, so that's exactly what we're going to do. We're gonna learn the anatomy of a wave. Now, we're going to take a
neutral color like that lavender and draw our wave in, so you can really see how the wave works. Now, this is what you call
a breaker or our major wave. You know, this is very important, the angle of these
brushstrokes, you see that? What things do people
really tend to do wrong when they're painting a wave is they either make a C or they make an S. Avoid those two brushstrokes when you're doing the
breaking part of this wave. Always repeat this line as you come over. Notice, it's over a forward
thrust and straight. If you can learn that stroke right there, that's really the basis
of a good seascape. Okay, so you want your
baseline straight at an angle and these strokes over and straight. All right, I’m good. Pick up more that lavender. And I'm going to use it as
the underpainting for the foam on this crashing wave. See that? It's gonna come way up
there and break the horizon. Now again, this is the underpainting. Now, what you don't wanna do is to pick up a bunch of white paint
and start making foam. In oil painting, it's nice
to go from dark to light. Now, all paintings seem to
go through an ugly stage. If somebody walks in your studio
when you're at this stage, they wonder, what the heck you're doing. You can just tell them that
that's the anatomy of the wave. Okay, this is all underpainting. All right, now this part of the wave, this area right in there
is the transparency. That's when the light is
coming from behind the wave in the thin part of the water and then shining through the wave and that what's people love in a seascape and they think it's really magic. You're gonna find out
today that it's easy to do and it's really fun. Okay, what we're gonna do now is we're gonna pick up
straight thalo blue, and lay it right on top
and overlap this black from here to the edge of the painting. I'm picking up straight thalo blue and I'm going to go right over the top of that black. And then we'll have to
keep picking up paint, overlapping that black line
on this side of the wave. Now this is a fun thing I do next. I'm not really gonna clean my brush, I'll just wipe some of
the extra paint out. I'm gonna pick up straight yellow. But what happens with this dirty brush going right on top of this blue, is it's going to turn green. So what I've got so far is
three stripes, a black stripe, a blue stripe, and a yellow stripe that’s turned green. All right. Now, I'm gonna wipe that off my brush. Do the quick rinse in paint thinner, and I'm gonna pick up a
color here that I've mixed, this is just white with a
mixture of yellow in it. I call this my sunshine color. So if I tell you to pick up
sunshine, you know that that's gonna be my pale yellow
that's here on my palette. So we're gonna put some
sunshine in our wave, the whole top half of this wave, we'll paint it with sunshine. As long as there's nothing on my canvas, I continue to put medium in my paint that makes the paint flow off the brush. Now, again, in this area, in this particular part of the wave, we wanna use a good amount of paint. You don't want it thick and gooey but you want a nice, even color. All right, now we got four stripes. Crazy way to paint a seascape, isn't it? I've got black, straight thalo blue, straight cad yellow that
turned green and sunshine. Okay, then I'm gonna wipe
the paint out of my brush. And I'm gonna start on this edge at about, an-inch-and-a-half two-inch
stroke and I'm blending. I'm starting at the bottom
and just going back and forth until those colors start
to mix on the canvas. And as they do, I gradually
move up to the top of the wave. Get the nice colors I'm getting in there, getting blues, and greens and-- See that? And I'll continue to move
across that canvas doing that, wiping the brush at each section. See, I have plenty of paint on there so that it keeps blending. If there wasn't enough
paint, it wouldn't blend it would leave minimal
brushstrokes than this is. Now, we'll smooth this out in a minute but right now, this is really important. This is the eye or transparency, or think of it as an egg shape. You wanna blend with your brushstroke right up that egg shape. Now, what everybody does
at this stage that is a mistake, is they
wanna make it too steep. I can't tell you how
many times I have to say, lay that stroke down. Keep it parallel to the
baseline and lift it up gently. And then you should go out
towards the edge of the wave, you lay it down more and more. Keep it gentle. All right, now it takes
a lot of blending in this transparent part. You have to work on it quite a bit to get a nice, smooth glow. Remember not to lose your darks
and keep your lights light, and to get a nice mid-tone in between. Actually, I'm doing that X tail. Do you see that when I'm going
back and forth with my brush? Almost all of my blending
is done with an X. All right, I'm gonna switch
to a little bit larger brush so that I can blend a little faster and pull a
little of that paint off. As I picked up some of this paint, I'll clean my brush up there, how's that? I use some of that color. Okay, this is gonna be really nice. Remember, this is the most
important part of your painting so you wanna spend a little time on it. Try to make a real gradual blend on this. You can go back and add more sunshine in this transparent part too to bring, give yourself more light. Okay, so that's the major
part of your basic wave. Now this water that comes over, take your medium, go into the dark, pick up some blue, and
pick up some yellow, that's just exactly the
way your stripes were. You had the black, blue and yellow and that's what we're gonna do right here with that brushstroke I told you about. We need more blue, then more yellow. Keep that stroke straight, remember that. It's really good to put a smile. When I have a happy painting,
you need a smile, right? So I'm gonna take some yellow. I'm gonna make a smile right there. Now that smile, will show when we pull
that paint over the top. Pull it back that way. I'm gonna pick up more blue. So what's so nice about this is you can make these
colors go any direction, you can change them back and forth from blues to greens, to yellows. It gives you lots of
multiplicity of color. All right, I'm gonna take this
color that I have in my brush with the blue and the yellow
to do some of these back wave. Now this is a swell that's
behind the major wave. Now the next swell will
be a little bit lighter so I'll take some of that same blue color and mix it in to that
lavender to lighten it. Put in another swell. Do you see an ocean happening here yet? Okay, remember I said, I'd go
back and blend that horizon, I'm gonna soften that really fast. That really gives you distance. So what nice distance we get there. All these paint, I can
move around a little bit 'cause it's been setting a little bit. A nice, large brush is
terrific for blending. Okay, we're gonna cover
the rest of this canvas with blue right under here. I'm gonna have beach in this, this is just going to be our
basic wave in an open ocean. Now the blue right under
the wave is a little darker 'cause it's a little bit in shadow, and it will get lighter as it comes down. Pretty easy, isn't it? People thinks seascapes
are hard and they are but, you get a few basics, really helps a lot. I like my canvas to be loose on the easel so I can turn it upside
down and move it around. But you might like to have
yours anchored a little better. Kind of banging it around here, aren't I? You don't have to paint
this painting at home in half an hour, you can take your time. All right, notice what I'm gonna do now. I'm going to actually
take some of these here and pull it up on that wave
so it all ties it together. I don't really wanna lose that dark 'cause that's what makes
that wave curl over. Did you see how now it's
all part of the ocean? This black line over here is the shadow. Okay. Now we're gonna highlight and put sunshine on our foam. And I just pick up some sunshine, now, that foam will start
making more sense to you. You'll pick up all your watercolors
in the foam, that's okay 'cause foam is just little
bubbles of water, isn't it? And pull paint off. Don't have your foam thick and gooey, I think that's really important. I see students lots of times
when they make their foam way too thick. Can you see how really thin my painting is there in the foam area? All right, I'm gonna
pick up more sunshine. I'm using quite a bit of
paint here on the edge where it picks up more light. By having that under the
painting with thin paint, I can keep building up
with more and more paint. All right, so we’ve got foam, we've got our major wave, let's put some foam coming over that wave. Watch this, this is fun. Notice, I keep repeating that same stroke. Notice how that changes it too. All right, we're gonna take more sunshine and add it to the rest of our painting. Again, a little bit of medium and we're gonna add sunshine way back here sort of a cradle stroke. Now, pick up some more sunshine. And as it go further back, the swells get closer together and our stroke gets flatter and flatter. Now in the front, we can add more sunshine to give us motion in the water here. Can you see that motion? This is just sunshine on our brush and a cradle stroke. Practice doing this getting them the flow of the cradle stoke. Okay. We've got some waves
going in the foreground. You can spend a lot more time on detail. This gives you your
basic anatomy of a wave. It gives you a start. Let's be tricky and throw in a couple of seagulls really fast. Whoa, wrong brush, not with that one, you need a liner brush. Pick up our black paint. I use a mahl stick a lot, it
really helps me brace my hand. I think a seagull will do a lot for this. How's that? Add a couple more over here. Okay, now there's a lot we
could do to this painting, a lot more motion we can put in our water. But I think that it's
a good time to sign it 'cause this is a half hour painting, a lesson for you on how to
paint the anatomy of a wave, Ortner is the last name on this painting. And now we have the anatomy of a wave. Remember the baseline of
your wave, the transparency, motion of the water, a straight horizon and you can paint a seascape. What do you think Bob? - I think that's fantastic Joyce. I think everyone at home will
really enjoy this painting. It shows a great deal of how you go about building a wave. So, on behalf of all us here, we'd like to wish each and
everyone of you, happy painting, God bless. We'll see you next week. (relaxing music)
