(gentle music) - Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Today I thought we'd just do a beautiful warm little winter scene. So let's start out, have them do all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. They'll come across, right about there. So tell you what... Let me show you what I've done up here. I've got my standard old canvas up here. This is a double prime
pre-stretched canvas. We don't recommend canvas boards. And onto that, I put a
piece of contact paper with an oval cut out of it. And that's basically all we've done. Just covered this with liquid
white and it's ready to go so. Let's go. And today we're gonna use
a very limited palette which means we're only
gonna use a few colors. So let's start out with a
little alizarin crimson. Just a little, on the 'ol two-inch brush. That'll go right up here. And just bouncing a little bit of pink. And this is one of those paintings that just, it should make you happy. Just enjoy this. This is not something you should
labor over or worry about. Enjoy it. If you've been with us before, you've probably heard me say it. "If painting does nothing else,
it should make you happy." It should make you happy. There. Okay, let's do it using a
little criss-cross strokes. Just little x's, that's all, that's all. And with the 'ol two-inch brush it doesn't take too long to
really cover a lot of area. And when you get done, shoot
you can go out in the yard and paint a barn, or
the house, or whatever. There. I know these look like
house painting brushes but they're really not, they're
very fine artist brushes. There we go. Okay, right on up, i don't know, wherever,
maybe about to here. Looks like a big Easter egg already. There, now then, let's take, let's take, we
won't even clean the brush cause alizarin crimson is
not a very strong color. We'll go right into a little phthalo blue and just put a little into the bristles and tap the bristles. See that gets a nice even
distribution of color all the way through the bristles, and that's what we're looking for. Otherwise if you just
hit that big gob of paint and go up here, you're
gonna have huge blue streaks that are very hard to work out. Work those bristles in the color. There, and we'll start at the top and just blend a little
touch of that blue into here. I don't want a great deal. Just a little, just a little. And let it blend downward. About like so. Shoot you can even tap in a little stringy cloud here
and there if you want it. But we'll come back and
blend this in a second. Right now we're just putting
little color in, like that. And while we got it on the brush, let's add a little bit down
here in the bottom part, which will probably be water. So I say, I think you'll do a little winter picture today. Winter picture's are very nice. I enjoy doing them. And I like to make winter scenes
with a little warmth in 'em that's why I use the pink. Bu some people, when I was
talking to my friend Kim just the other day from New Jersey. And he said we wanted
a scene that was cold. If you want a cold scene,
then all you need to do is just take and leave the pink out, just use blue and greys. Mix a little midnight black with it. Shoot, you'll have a cold
winter scene guaranteed. Now then, let's wash the 'ol brush. That's the fun part. Shake it off. (laughs) There we go,
we're in business now. Now the brush is good and clean and dry. And the cameraman's covered again. We can just take this, and blend it out. Just blend it. And when the two come together, you'll get sorta a lavender color, which is very pretty. There. Something about like so and down here, we just go gently, gently
all the way across. We're not applying much pressure. Just enough to sorta
blend everything together. Okay. Now then, today let's
build us a little cloud. We'll use a fan brush today. Let's go right into titanium white. Good 'ol titanium white. And we'll go up here, and I"m just going to put in an indication of just a happy little cloud. Using just the corner of the fan brush, and you can do this, you can do this with a one-inch brush, works very well, very well. There we go. And maybe, let me get another fan brush. Let's have two of them going. Maybe you want to put a
little color into the cloud. We can take a little blue,
a little alizarin crimson, and we'll make a lavender color here. I'm gonna grab a little white. Little lavender color. Little bit, ooh that's pretty nice. That's coming along. And just adjust it back and forth until it's what you want it. And let's go up in here,
and we'll just come in, and we'll put a little, a
little color underneath. There. That's all there is to it. Little more of the white. That'll sorta mix it together. There, let me find a big brush. Now, clean dry, two-inch
brush, very gently, using just the corner, just the corner. And I like the two-inch brush, cause it has a lot of bristles on it, and it will fluff it, lift
it, tease it a little, and then very gently go across. Isn't that a nice way of making a very effective little cloud. (laughs) You can do that maybe right here. We'll have another little cloud. And you can do this either way. You can put the light in
first, and then the dark it doesn't much matter. As long as you blend them together gently. Let a light in, get my little
fan brush that has that touch of dark color on it. A little loving under the
base, under the bottom. That'll indicate the
lights coming from above. And then very gently,
three hairs and some air. All we do is just, stir it
up, mix it up, blend it, fluff it, lift it, and then very lightly just go over it like that. There, and you can put
clouds in front of clouds. Maybe you want another little
cloud, little baby cloud maybe lives right here. Maybe this is a mommy cloud here. There, can't never tell. Who knows, who knows, There we go, blend 'em together. Give that a little fluff. And off we go. Ain't that easy, we got some nice little
very effective clouds. That just float around in the
sky, have a good time all day. Wash the 'ol fan brush off. And as you know, we just wash the brushes
in odorless thinner, the little brushes I just wipe
on a paper towel to dry 'em. Now then, let's take a midnight
black and alizarin crimson, just black and crimson
today, what the heck. That's all we need. Put these two together, makes
a very dark lavender color. Cut off our little roll of paint, right at the edge of the knife. And maybe in our world there lives, or there does now, maybe
there's a mountain right here. Okay, this is an extremely
simply little painting we're gonna do today. Just want to show you
how effective it can be. Just playing with some colors. Very simple little painting. This is the type painting that one of our instructors would teach probably in the first
or second day of class. And you could do it. And we have instructors
that travel all over the United States spreading
the joy of painting. There, take a large brush,
grab this, and pull it. Pull it. Fact maybe earlier in the series, you saw Damen Jester on the show here with us, with the squirrels all over him. (laughs) I had to have somebody to help me with all the little rascals, he had four of them here in the studio, and well they were giving us a fit. They wanted to play. And as you know, in a television studio you have to be sorta
quiet and not run around. They don't know that rule, they just wanted to have a good time and play with everybody here, and of course everybody
here fell in love with them. There, but we want this
now to blend right into the nice soft misty area there. Very soft, alright. Let's take our knife, this is a fun part. This is a fun part, I'm
gonna take titanium white, pull it out as flat as I can get it, add the least little touch
of alizarin crimson to it. Least little touch to it. Just to warm it up a little,
give it a little warm flavor. Pull it out flat, once again, cut across, and we get out very small little paint, right on the edge of the knife. There we go. Now then, let's have our
light coming from the right, cause I'm right-handed
and that's normally easier for right-handed people. There we go. Swoomp See there, now then maybe have
a little snow right there. For everyone, just think about where light will zing through there and play. Make all these little
highlights on the mountain. That's really all we're
looking for at this point. There we go, I really and
truly enjoy doing mountains. As I mentioned before, I lived in Alaska for about a dozen years. And they have some of the most beautiful mountains scenery there that I've ever seen. Absolutely gorgeous. Alright, I had been born
and raised in Florida. I was 21 years old before I ever saw snow. Shoot that's been nearly
10-12 years ago now. (laughs) Well maybe a little more than that. Okay, there, devil's gonna
get me for telling stories. Little blue, a little black into it, and off we go, everybody
around here is laughing when I say it was just 10 or 12 years ago. Cut off a little roll of
paint, and go right up here. Touch, and let's put in
the indication of some nice little shadow areas here. No pressure, absolutely no pressure. Just let the knife
barely graze the canvass. Just barely touch it. And that's what causes all that breaking, you want all those little holes in there. You want them in there. There, getting maybe a
little shadow right in there. Wherever, wherever. Then we can come back, and we can begin adding
all kinda of little extras in our mountain. See you can do this, you can
put all kinds of little things that you want in there. You can do it. On this canvass you can do
anything that you want to do. Total power. There we go. There we go. Very gently, very gentle. No pressure. There, sometimes it's nice to go back and pick up a little of that dark, and lay a little dark
indication here and there. Just makes it look like there's some deep shadows some places. There we go. But don't overdo, you
can overdo real quick. Real quick. There, it's a trick I learned from my son. You can make some
beautiful mountains, there. Okay, now then we'll just
take a clean, dry brush and tap this, all over the angles. Always follow the angles, there we go. And lift it. That takes out the tab marks,
brings everything together. That easy. Over here, we'll follow these angles. Just however you painted it, that's exactly the angle
you want to follow. If you're coming on like this,
and go all the way across, it's gonna look like somebody
took a big razor blade and just cut it off, and just
sorta left it hanging there. So follow those angles. There, and let's go and
grab a little of that white, let it look like a little reflected light going down the side there. Another little thing that's fun, take a little of that same shadow color, and just tap in, like so. There it is. Maybe there's just a
little hill right there. And that sorta pushes everything back, it gives another plane. Just like that. Okay, looks like there's
a little white paint up here in the sky that I sorta missed. Didn't see it. But we'll just put a shadow
under, ain't that easy. And we'll turn it into
another little peak. (laughs) See we don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents. Cause the mountain looks better now with a peak like that. There. Okay, now then. Let's take, tell you what let's do today, tell you what let's do, I have
some lavender mixed up here. Let's see what it looks like. We'll take lavender, put
a little white in it. And I want it more to the crimson side, so alizarin crimson,
phthalo blue, and white that's really all we have here. I'll make a nice, sorta
light little lavender. Ooh that's nice, I like that right there. Right there, but when you do yours, if you want it more to
the blue or the red side, that's up to you. That's totally up to you. Here's a dirty fan
brush, we'll just use it. Same one I was making the clouds with, this is number three fan brush. But you can use your six. Alright, load it full of
color, lot of color on it. Let's go up here. Maybe in our world, yep, see, right there we'll push in a little tree. And I'm pushing upward here. I want these particular Evergreens to have a little upward arms on 'em. Depending on where you live, Evergreens are different, in some places, the limbs sorta hang downward. In other places, they sorta push upward. And also depends on the kinda tree it is. There's a lot of different
types of Evergreen trees. There, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe yep. Put another one there, this one's maybe got a little crook. I hate having all my
trees perfectly straight. I really rather see trees that
have some character to 'em. I always tell myself that maybe, when that tree was young,
maybe somebody stepped on it, or maybe a squirrel ate
it's top off or something. I don't know. But just anything. Just to keep it from being too bland. And there we are. Okay now then, I'm gonna... that's pretty clean. (laughs) There we'll just take that brush, and I just want to begin tapping this. And we'll pick up a little of this color, and bring it over here,
and then let it just fade right on out to nothing. See how soft that gets. Good. Alright. Now then, take a little
of that same color, and let's decide where we
would have a little reflection, and maybe it's right there. Pull it straight down. Just a tiny bit of that
reflection, and go across. Now then, let's take us some
liquid white, liquid white. I'm gonna put a little touch
of alizarin crimson into it. Just enough to warm it up
a little, so it feels good. Pull it out flat, cut across see. Flat, cut across. Now then, we take that
and we go right up here. And let's just cut us
in a little water line. Just cut it in. There, just sorta let it
wander back into there. There we go, wipe my knife often. There, maybe there's a little ripple here. We don't want too many. Just a few little things in there. Now then, why do I still got that
number three fan brush going. I guess it's okay. Doesn't make much difference,
whatever works for you. Clean off a spot, and let's
take black and Prussian blue. Prussian blue is strong, strong, strong. Crimson, so we got black, Prussian blue, and alizarin crimson. There we are. Very dark though, very dark color. Should look black. Cleaning off the old knife here. And, let me just wipe the excess of that number three fan brush. We'll use it, lessly, it doesn't matter. Alright, now, this good dark color and the brush is fully loaded. Let's have us a tree
that lives right there. Start off with just a little line, then we're gonna push upward. Blueish upward. And with that, we'll make our happy little Evergreen tree. Just like that. There you goes. There it goes. Yeah, see that's all there is to it. I want to make several of these. And while I"m making these, let me share another one of
my little creatures with you. As I say, I am such a nut
for these little creatures. This is my crow here. And he lives with me,
we call him Midnight. Ain't he a mean looking sun of a gun. And he's one of the
nicest little creatures that you ever seen. That's midnight. He lives in my backyard right now. And sorta a sad story with him. Somebody tried to shoot his wing off. And its, he didn't do
too good for a while. We didn't know if old Midnight was gonna make it for a long time. But a lot of nice people have helped him. And I think he's gonna make it. He's gonna be okay now. But he'll never be able to fly again. Which is, it's hard to watch that, when you see something
as beautiful as he is. And he'll never be able to fly again. There. Now then, we'll take, let's
just grab this two-inch brush, pull some reflections under there. Pull it straight down.
Straight down, straight down. And go across. There, right. Now then. let me find, let me find, we use a one-inch brush. We'll pop in a couple little bushes. Put some dark color that'll end up being bushes in here. There we go. This is that same dark color. Now then. Let's take our knife, just cut right through there to make the indication of a few little trunks
and sticks and everything. There. Do you like that old crow? He's something else. He is something else. He's a pretty nice little bird though. I hate it that he, as I say, he'll never be able to fly, though that bothers me terribly. That somebody would just shoot him, just for the heck of it. Let me grab a little pink here. And I'm not opposed to hunting. My father was an avid hunter. But I'm opposed to shooting things for no reason. Let's pull a little color in here. This is just titanium white with a little alizarin crimson, it
won't warm it up some. And we go up here. And lets just put this in. Just a beautiful little snow-covered bush. Right out here on the edge. There, a little more of the liquid white. And the liquid white's in
there only to thin the color. Because as you know, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. And the color we have up
here initially is very thick. I want another one, maybe right in there. Work in layers. One layer at a time. Now you can reverse the brush, see there. Put some little doers
down here in the water. Down in the water. And this is your test to
see how gentle you are. Barely touch, and go down, go across. And we can make those nice
little mirror reflections. (laugh) I like those. They're fun. Now then, we'll take blue, we'll just use some titanium
white, what the heck. What the heck. Come right along here. And just put in a little bit of snow. Like that. There we go. A little bit of our liquid white, that we can come back, cut us in a water line. There we are. And off we go, we take the clean edge of the knife,
scratch us in a stick and a twig. Then we're in business. And I'll tell you what, today i want to pull this oval off now. And I"m gonna play a
little bit, you know me. (paper peeling) Let's just take that right off there. And we'll lound, there we go. Now then. I always like to have big
trees in my paintings. So guess what, guess what, you're right. Let's take that old dark
tree color fan brush and I went to a number six fan brush, I want it to be bigger. Let's go right there. We're gonna cut right
outside of this oval. And we're gonna let this big old tree. We're gonna let him look
out into the sunlight. And there he goes. There he goes. There. Okay, pushing upward though. Always pushing upward. There, I wish I had done
this with a two-inch brush, because this tree is becoming. Didn't know it was going
to be quite that big. But that's alright. Let it go, let it go. Boy, when I said big tree,
I was serious this time. Whew. I"m gonna stop it there. Otherwise it's gonna
eat up the whole world. The tree that ate up the world. Sounds like a nice theme for
a horror movie or something. Go, another little tree. I gotta have a friend for him. Gotta have a friend for him. Otherwise he'll get lonely sitting here. There. Don't want him lonely. Push upward though. Continue to push it upward. Now then, I'm going back
to my one-inch brush that has the dark color on it. Somehow I have to stop this tree. So we'll put a bush up under his foot. There we got him slowed down now. We got him slowed down. Maybe, well we'll just come out here. What the heck. Let your imagination go when you're doing these little paintings. That's what makes it fun. Just let 'em go. Let 'em go. There, there take a little white, little dark Sienna. mix it together, and let's come up here. Put the indication just here and there. Of a little trunk that
lives in these trees. I don't want 'em much. Grab another fan brush, I'm gonna take titanium white, and a little bit of phthalo blue on it. White and blue. And let's come back in here. And I want to put a few little highlights on this big 'ol tree here. So just phthalo blue and white. Like that. Hmm, think about shape and form. I know you get tired of hearing that. But it is so important. Don't just throw this in at random. You'll be unhappy. Little bit on this tree too. Don't want as much on that one. There, darker, darker,
darker, down to there. And these little ones back here. I"m gonna put a little
one back in here too. Don't want them left out. These are farther away, so I don't want as much detail in them. Just enough so you know they got a little little something happening in them too. And going to liquid white,
little bit of the crimson, and let's go in here, and
let's put some nice highlights on these little bushes
that live right in here. There we go. See just drop 'em in. Drop 'em in. Maybe there's one who lives right there. And we got a minute left here so... let's put a little path. Take a little white. We gotta have a way to get
back to this big 'ol tree. There it goes. Just happy little path
that lives right there. We need just a couple
of bushes on this side. And that will push that
path right back in there. We need our dark in there first. Then a little liquid white,
a little titanium white, and we'll put a bush over here. Shoot, isn't that a nice
way though of making just a beautiful little winter scene? And you can do this, I
think you'll enjoy it. So I'll tell you what. (laughs) I think with that, we're
gonna call that one finished. From all of us here. Happy painting, God bless my friend. (relaxing music)
