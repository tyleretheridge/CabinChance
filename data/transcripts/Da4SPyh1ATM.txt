hey welcome back certainly glad you could join me again today got your palace set up let's get going here let's start off from having graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and they'll come across as usual in the same order that I have them on the palette starting with the white and working around while they're doing that let's go on up here I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of liquid white it's nice and wet and slick and all ready to go I thought maybe today let's do a little fall scene where maybe the weather is not too great you know in the fall we have a lot of rainy weather now you know the snows gonna come pretty soon so let's do something like yet and just just have some fun I'm gonna start out using a small a small amount of yellow ochre just the tiniest little bit a very small amount and right here sort of make a determination where the horizons gonna be and I'm gonna begin swinging this upward just using strokes like so a little bit more color don't have a little water in this paint as you know I'm I'm sort of a water fanatic like that water little yellow in here okay I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyck Brown in the same way just tap the brush into it okay let's go right up here put a little brown right in here I'm beginning to create these sky angles just don't let him get too too straight like this it'll it'll disturb you when it's done now I'm gonna take brown and a touch of Prussian blue let me say that again a Dutch Prussian blue is so strong just a little bit miss brown and blue okay yes we can bring that all together add a touch of the midnight black to it so now we have in the sky we have a little bit of yellow ochre some Brown sort of pression blue and some midnight black we just gonna sort of work all of these Baskerville colors together try to keep the blue off that yellow or you'll get a very pretty sky and then before we start blending them we still have a dirty old brush and we'll take some more the Prussian blue and a little bit of the black there we go and let's go ahead and lay our water in both on the outside in see if you start if you start from here and go across watch what happens you touch here and go across you get this big line that's bad and then it's hard to blend out so starting the outside and come over and that way you don't have that harsh line that you have to blend out there we go little tricks like that save ya save you a lot of agony we want this to be easy we want it to work for you okay a little bit more of the midnight black compression blue mixture don't want to kill all that nasty yellow area that you have because of blue little black ball heat it up in a heartbeat okay a little darker at the bottom then there's at the top that'll help create your illusion of distance okay let me wash the old brush wash the old brush shake off the excess that is the fun part okay let's go right back up here and I'm gonna begin blending this together follow the angles in the sky I'm gonna use long strokes start in the light area and work up toward the darker area that way you brush is dirty when it gets to the top use your clean brush in the lighter and you can just begin bringing all this together all of those angles though okay that gives us a quick happy little sky down here we just go all the way across straightens out the water and brings it all together and we're ready then I get a little fan brush here we'll mix up let's take a little black a little ground a tiny bit of oppression blue and a little bit of alizarin crimson into that I'll put some white here and put a little bit of that into it yeah add a little more blue to that and the touch more crimson there we go that's sort of what I'm looking for so a very dark lavender to the blue side it's very dark it's almost a gray color this is gonna be a great cloudy day okay let me wipe off my knife now let's take the old fan brush and go right through a little bit of color don't need a lot of paint on the brush yet stab just a little and a small amount of Brown into that a little a little more into the brownish color there we go good let's go right up here now back in here you have to make a decision maybe their lives some happy little evergreens just take the corner of the brush just back and forth just sort of pop in just a little evergreen some indications are some that are even farther away all we see is just the basic shapes I'm just touching and sort of pulling it downward so he's make all cants a little basic shapes see touch use a top part of the brush if you just give it a little downward snap there a little more paint on the brush maybe over here we got some to be careful of these will get looking like fence posts that's good enough yeah I want to put a few more indication of some trees that have a little more shape to them and we're just using the corner of the brush and just work them in back and forth these little trees live right in your fan brush sometimes you have to sort of scare them out there and you just put as many or as few as you want in your world there we go he's got a little friend there just drop them in yeah then I want to create the illusion of mist back here I want this to be very soft and very distant so we'll take the 2 inch brush and tap I'm using a top corner see look how hard is hitting it's bending really getting here and tap it and you can create the illusion of very very soft area back here you've let it come up above some of these they're really softened so these trees are already there already just lost ready to be missed can you believe how that pushes all that back just that little tapping action ok man now listen let's have another plane in the painting and a plane I mean just another area that's closer to you so we'll take those same old colors we'll use some brown I'm gonna put some dark Sienna in there this toe and a little bit of SAP green as things get closer we'll begin to see a little more detail just a little SAP green though ok brushes are really full of paint let's go right up in here there it is these trees are a little closer they're a little bit bigger look at that turn it over over to use both sides of it there we go this trees stronger he's he got a little more light okay we don't want him to get lonely so we'll give him a friend too you know friends are so important finally the trees but to us and through painting I have made oh I've made hundreds and hundreds of new friends all over the country and that may be the most rewarding part of all this most thrilling part there I take it one here's a happy little tree you is right there just sort of just sort of visualize in your mind where you think tria true you'd be happy and you put him in there just put him in de take a little bit of the dark Sienna and just tap it onto this brush and then I want to gather up some of this color that we had on a tree and begin very softly putting in little Hills okay there see pick up some of that tree color and just let it just let it go there was a tiny bit of dark Sienna on the brush tiny bit tiniest little bit see how you can set those trees out up on a little hill and they may be getting pulling that down I don't want this to be very very soft very quiet I like very gentle little paintings that when you're doing yours at home if you want it to be brighter and stronger just use a little stronger color cause painting is a very individual thing there okay now let's go right back into here and load up just load that fan brush full of paint okay tell you what let's do let's have a tree that lives right there yeah we take just the corner of the brush and if we can't working him down then you can just push that all free right out of that brush a little more paint gonna push it hard when you get down this far when you first start you're pushing quite easy by the time you get down here yeah getting tough with it just wrong with it little more color okay I'll tell you what just do it right here big side of a gun see all these different sizes of trees help create the illusion of distance depth in your painting a beginning to look like follow you sort of a mean old sky okay now then the Mogu back into a little tiny tiny a little bit of the dark sea and a tiny can't say that enough times and I'm gonna create another plane here I'm gonna pick up some of the tree color see ya and all I'm doing is just tapping the canvas just half I will bring you right on cross add the least little touch more of the sin there see it creates a whole nother plane and pushes all those trees back here back into the distance and that's you now I'm gonna have water here so let's take a little bit of that color you just pull it down so we have a little reflection I'm using just a little bit of the dark see I'm a little van Dyck Brown on the brush to pull down and create a reflection here just a just a happy little reflection like right there and it likely go across okay now then then we'll take the same old brush without cleaning it just same old dirty brush and tap right into a little bit of the yellow ochre and the bright red and just tap it gently see just tap ok now then here this is a little closer so we're beginning to see an indication of some highlights and same way just gently gently tapping that was bright red and a tiniest little touch of that yellow okay now the red is very strong be careful with it be careful of it it'll eat up your whole world in just a second take a little brown it was dark Sienna mixed together pull it out cut across get that small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife okay just a little lay on dedication scrubbing across the canvas Tiny's little bit add a little white to that same color like that and then it's just an indication of a touch of highlight here I don't I don't want much highlight in this just to touch here a little bit of the liquid white got across it and we'll put just an indication of a little water right not too much not too bright okay yeah then go back into my Browns CNN the Van Dyke and I'm gonna grab some more this tree color I'm gonna put a little peninsula I think it comes right out here and when you're doing this just step back and look at your painting and make make decisions just make decisions pull a little bit of this color down just a little go gently gently across the house same old dirty brush back into my yellow ocher and bright red mixture just a little same old dirty brush you can get over here and a little bit of this CAD yellow to it sorry yeah see follow the angles of the land the lay of the land just follow it right on to have a brighter on top and it darker darker darker as it works down if you want to show a little protrusion here see see easy that is creates the illusion have another little hill just by changing the value of the color for the intensity a little bit of that right down to the water go across you have instant reflections let's play a little bit over here tell you what this do we use a round brush and go right into my Browns us the sienna and the Van Dyck tap out the excess just go up here back in here there's some happy little trees maybe maybe these are the birch trees and there we back in the distance just put some little indications thanks like so use the old script planner brush just take it a little paint thinner on it to go right into the brown turn it bring it to a sharp point let's put just a few basic very basic indications of a tree branch here in there little tree trunk I'm not looking for a lot of detail same old dirty brush now go into a small small amount of the yellow ocher and the bright red smallest little mouth I'm just barely touching then I want to just touch right at the top here put some indications begin forming some basic little patterns some little shapes into your trees don't just throw these on the random I know I say that in every show but I get the most letters about that I said my my tree shapes don't look right and that's normally normally the problem 99% of the time the problem is as a color is just throw it on at random so to look at it practice it a little bit of practice here will pay you tremendous dividends tremendous dividends just a few little bushes and all kinds of things okay tell you what a little brown let's put a little land area right there see right there I need a little bit of a highlight color that's just a little brown and white not too much just a little here little bit of a liquid white catus a little waterline I'm going right back into the Browns I have yet to wash this brush I've been going back and forth between the Browns and highlight colors and now I'm gonna put another little Peninsula the libs right there so you don't care if the bottom of it sort of comes down because you just pull that down mm-hmm that easy that easy makes a little reflections and then lightly like they go across go right into our color now the ochre bright red little Indian yellow here and there and they'll care yellow but a few little highlights on it okay I mean say ed you can put a little land under that just a little dirt just a little dirt like so and maybe take a little liquid black maybe there's a happy little tree dude lives right out there there we go he lives out on this little Peninsula give me little foots to stand on don't him don't him to fall over he's a strong little tree but all kinds of little films there we go few little sticks and twigs down here and when you're doing this at all you put as many sticks and threes as you want in there okay back to my Browns with surplus bills let's build a little more here come right down here so to fill all this up I just see all kinds of things Oh - maybe about there once again when you work in layers working stages completing the most distant area first and working forward always working forward tell you what miss let's have some fun we'll put a little cabin back here a little house would it be nice to live here and watch all the big Canadian geese come in and right there that's where a little house will be we'll give them a little roof just pulling over right down there we go all I'm doing here is blocking in color just pakka get some color okay we'll take some white from the dark Sienna little bit of Van Dyke Brown probably got flat a little roll of paint okay I have there's some boards in this old building that go this way see they come right across like yeah doop doop doop well cut him off but that dark and then maybe down here just maybe a little log cabin there's my the indication of some things going like here look at that look at that it's now darker cut on this side just put some indications and we need something on the roof I had a little fright red duster color just a tiny bit and right down the roof here just better knife sort of basket boo boo boo boo boo boo boo got to make that noise or don't work didn't work don't take at least a little bit of light color just a little white or something I'm just a highlight that so it stands out and you can see it just so you can see it dark down in here maybe maybe this house had stolons underneath you just take the point of the knife in and just very quickly just scratching in some basic hole stones he has a basement in his house he's really got a fancy cabin out here and get the little toy for a second okay take a little bit of the Venn diagram let's have him adorn maybe he's got one door right down here so we can come right in the basement cut that right off where you want it he was just a little white on the knife to sort of highlight that and it will take a small agent knife little bit of Prussian blue just put the indication of a few little windows in there I'm that easy makes us a happy little thing okay let's go back to to bouncing right into some of this color bright red yellow ocher CAD yellow yeah let's come right down in here oh that's a pretty light now if you have any trouble at all we can your paint stick add a little tiny tiny bit okay liquid white or paint thinner whichever good white will change your color a little bit make it a little brighter one don't take the little knife again come right in here we'll put a happy little path coming out he's got that way to get down to the lake catch a big fish it goes down here that'll bit of land some stones here and there just whatever brown and white for some highlights there we go now that let's go back into our ogres and reds and Indian yellow and let's begin bringing this right down I like this little painting because it really does give you the feeling of fall just like little layers little things happening all down through here I'll tell you what maybe right in here is a little tree maybe that's just a little maybe maybe that's a little birch tree like birch trees and they usually grow in clumps so you're gonna put several Evan three aware that birch tree grows by itself he's a community tree little bit of liquid black yeah we can just put the indication of a happy little them here and there that really helps push your little cabin back further into the painting much further back tell you what tell you let's have some fun let's go back into the Browns put another little peninsula right there and in your world you put as many or as few of these as you want just want to show you how to do it and turn you loose on the world all that straight down cow right across go right back into my highlight colors that yell up hookers and their heads just come right out here say they're you know happy highlights now won't take my fan brush again go right into the Ben Dyke Brown darks and I just mix them together okay right here right here right somewhere right here yeah just make a decision drop it down big old tree bagel tree and this big tree will help push everything in your painting back helps create much much more depth than your painting give it a big hole they go root stand on down here the big tree has to be grouped just make an indication of all they own that comes right out just tap it on a fan brush man we can take a little bit of the bright red darks and white together I think so let's cut across it let's go up here and just put some highlights on use these warm colors we're gonna make it feel like fall hmm I'm gonna get my coat out and start seeing if it's all right just a few little highlights here in there Andy back to my liner brush and right into the liquid black I said let's have some blooms that are just hanging there every which way just drop some of these in there is a line wherever you wanna pull them out see there and you can make all kinds of beautiful things happen there bill thank this one's getting close to being done but a little the ground area right in here touch a highlight on it and we'll call this painting finished I hope you've enjoyed this one it's a nice little painting could give you a lot of happy little ideas from all of us here happy painting god bless
