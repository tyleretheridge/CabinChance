hey I'm glad to see you again today today I thought we'd paint a little animated opening that you see at the beginning of each show that's a fantastic little picture only takes a couple of minutes to paint it but it takes a lot of super people a long time to animate it so I hope you're enjoying it to start off and have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started now I've already covered the canvas with a nice and even coat of the liquid white it's all wet and slick and and ready to to have a painting put on it so let's do that we're going to take all today we use the old two-inch brush and go right into a little touch of yellow ochre just a small amount just tap it right into the brush okay let's go up here now right up in the sky here you're just going to put the smallest touch of yellow allow that to blend for the liquid white so it's a very light in color now it'll look light against all this white but when we put the rest of this guy and everything in day and it'll look a lot brighter okay just something like so you need to throw a little bit down in here where we know the water is going to be okay let me clean the brush and we clean our brush with odorless dinner really recommend you use odorless thinner and just beat the devil out of it okay now then let's put some big clouds up here in the sky go right into the midnight black just tap the brush right into the black okay let's go up here now then we're just going to start laying in some very basic little shapes just work the brush back and forth I just sort of just play down in here that all these little things just happen I sort of let it come together here we go a little bit more maybe right in here now if you're not careful you'll lead up all your yellow ocher in just a second this black is many many times stronger than the yellow so don't be too crazy just just a little maybe a little right in here too okay now we need to clean the old brush again clean the old brush shake it off just beat the devil out of it okay now we're going to go right back into this and blend blend this see you can't tell where one color starts and the other color stops just very lightly blend it together you know for cleaning your brush at home they make a little thing called a brush beater rack you can put in the bottom of waste paper can contain all this I really don't recommend you start beating on the leg easel at home there okay and then all we have this brush I'll go right back into a touch of that black just tap it right onto the brush just a touch okay let's go back up here and with that we can just lay in what will eventually become our water there pull from the outside in you don't want to kill a little bit of yellow you have there in the center pull them outside you go to the other side and do the same thing like so okay then very lightly you can just go all the way across very lightly here you just barely fairly touching the canvas okay man and let's build us a fantastic little mountain I will let's start right up in here with that I'm gonna go right in to midnight black and to that I'm going to add a little bit of phthalo blue midnight black stay low blue pull out as flat as you can get it cut across and get that little roll of paint okay let's cop here now then we have to start making some decisions here here we're going to start laying in some basic mountain shapes and you're really pushing it at paint right into the fabric see just lay it all those nice shapes and the only thing that you're worried about is this nice edge up and you can cure less what's going on in here no problem at all in there we'll have another little bump right there another one out here just however many you want this is your mountain so you created any way that you wanted there we go now with the 2 inch brush we'll grab that and just pull it out as we've said before if you can see the entire Mountain it's always more distinct at the top than it is at the bottom so by pulling it out like this it blends with a liquid white and automatically that occurs you don't have to work you don't have to worry about it it just happens just happens that way that's really what makes it fun okay see already that gives you the impression it's just sort of floating around in the sky all right well cleans brush one more time shake on dinner your hand we're ready now then let's take titanium white pull it out very flat just glad as you can get it get get strong with it pull it out and cut across there we have that little roll of paint again okay now that make some decisions here whereas light striking your mountain no pressure no pressure and we're going to do this mountain in stages several different stages so we'll start out by just doing like so I'm gonna take some white a little bit of black a little bit of blue it will make a shadow color like so want this to be quite darkening a little more black to it there nice alright then once again we cut off that little roll of paint and let's go right up in here and begin adding some happy little shadows see there they are it's that easy easy you could do it all right now then let's say we're gonna go do this mountain in stages so let's take this part that's done here and for the clean dry brush gently tap it gently tap it and then lift upward see soften that one okay and then same basic thing again we're going to take this one and bring it distinctly over now the reason I soften that one is because I want this to look like it's in front see and now it'll set in front and push everything back and sneakier it's one of those ways that you make it make it look like things are happening without actually doing anything in painting you create illusions just illusions maybe that comes right on around now this won't be an exact duplicate of what you see at the beginning of each show but didn't show you how that particular painting was made can't ever do an exact duplicate okay now once again I'll take it we'll put in some happy little shadows here drop them in like that all kinds of little things happening here there we go you know I have so many fantastic friends all over the country and they send me letters which I really really enjoy and you know we get we get paintings from people we get pictures of paintings that they've done people just like you and I that watch the shows and they pick up a brush and they make an almighty painting and I thought I thought maybe today I put a few of them on a board that sort of like to share those with you maybe we can get them to just sort of run across and and let you see some of the fantastic things that people are doing now if you've sent me a painting and it's not up there apologize wood we'll put it up there next time send your paintings in let me see what you're doing it's super and we'll try to put them on the showing and share it with everybody hit that beautiful can you believe it people are watching TV and creating beautiful beautiful paintings like that and you can - you can - grab your brush and give it a try I think you'll be absolutely amazed at what happens there now I'm just putting another layer of mountains in here and lifting upward say now this mountain looks like it's in front of that one and we can carry that - you missed it father let's take this one here let it come down and let it come across see you can just make a layer after layer there's no end to this absolutely no into it there I really do love to hear from you if you have time do drop me a line I mentioned in one of the earlier shows we travel all over the country and we do demonstrations for for PBS stations and all kinds of charity groups all over and if we're in your city I'd love to see you come out and support your local station and spend some time with us and give me a chance to talk with you meet you and myself and my son Steve and some of our other certified teachers we're always on the go we're always doing demonstrations if you'd like to know who we're going to be in your area just drop me a card with your name and address and we'll put you on a mailing list and we'll let you know if we're going to be in your area there and you can just send didn't care the address that's at the end of the station they'll send it on to me I mean the end the show there we go all right now we'll tap this one the thing here is don't destroy this nice top light out of here you don't want to destroy that little line leave it there tap below soften then gently gently gently lift up right gently and that easy you've got several different ranges of mountains that's super okay now then let's build us some little foothills in here and for that I will take midnight black and I'm going to add some yellow ochre to it that makes a very from a very dark green probably still looks black when you set yellow ochre and midnight black I'm very dark when we clean off my knife there we go and for that I think we'll grab let's grab a fan brush or go into this dark green color okay let's go right up here yeah then let's have a little rolling foothill here and all we're gonna do take the brush and tap see use the roundness of the brush there here we go and maybe we'll have one right there and it goes right on out wherever you want it wherever there and all you doing is just tapping the canvas that easy it makes it a nice little little footy hill there where now then I want to create the illusion of a little bit of mist right here so I'm just gonna gently tap just right on the base just tap I'll make it very soft and very misty now they wouldn't take the same whole brush I go back into some yellow ochre and then hit that black like so see it makes a dark green color but it's a little lighter than what we put up there initially now we can go back and highlight that just by barely touching now if you have trouble making this stick add a little bit of paint thinner a little liquid clear either one that'll make it stick okay a little bit over here on this one I want it to be very dark still but have a green appearance now we might even want to brighten that in a few places yeah that's a little bit brighter maybe that'll show up a little better and you sit there yeah okay so you can just create all kinds of little things so and you can sneak in there and pick up a little bit of white just on the same brush so it lightens it it'll make it look like there's a little bit of light just playing through there and having fun and sparkling there you go okay let me wash the old brush hmm and brushes is not as much fun to watch because you don't get to beat it and bang it now then let's go back into our black with a little yellow ochre in it so very dark this is a really low debt brush full load it full okay now then right down in here we'll put another layer of little little footy hills and I know there's gonna be some reflections here so I'll just pull a little bit of that color right down that's that's gonna be my reflections later on now see right in here this little misty area that's left that's the only thing you have to separate these two so don't kill that little misty area it's very very important okay let's put another one maybe right there and in your world you're painting you put as many or as few of these as you want I just want to show you how and then you make the big decisions there we go now we can go back into some yellow and some that black and make us a nice green color load the fan brush full of paint see a lot of paint can't go back up here now then want to come in here and just put a little highlight on here don't kill all the dark it's almost a natural Tennessee to get carried away and kill all the dark the dark is so important it's what gives you what gives you little foothills depth distance dimension otherwise they're just flat and you pick up a little bit of titanium white and little look at there like there a little bit of light just just play you right across there see it really makes that sparkle it's like there's a little sunshine just bouncing all through that area okay good Totti it like that clean off the old brush mm okay now for the two inch brush let's create our reflections grab that and pull it straight down it's most important that you pull straight down if you pull it an angle it's not gonna look right to you pull it straight down and then very lightly go across and yeah instant reflections will take a little liquid white put it on here and pull it out very flat and just take your knife and cut across that's all you have to do okay then we go right up here and we'll drop in some happy little water lines I keep these lines basically straight even though you go you can go up and down with them keep the lines themselves basically straight this is what this was what keeps your water contained in your painting saying put a happy little ripple here and there those two need to be basically straight all right I think we had some some evergreens that lived right in here so let me mix up some color we'll take some of the black and the yellow ochre into it again black and yellow ochre so thanks a super super dark green and we'll put a little bit of it over here and add a little white to it so I have same color but two different values see it's the same color but one has a little white in okay and we'll start with the lightest one and I'll load the fan brush full of color maybe a touch darker there we go I can't let's go right up here now little evergreen lives right here now we're going to use a corner brush and give it an upward push so the little limbs go upward you can make them going upward or downward whichever I'm gonna chair okay we'll put another one right there there they are when you use all the paint out of one corner the breasts turn it over use the other corner just recently put two sides on the brush there Kenny maybe tell you what yep right here I have a third little tree yes I can and that nice way to make little evergreens okay then I'm going into a touch of green with same old dirty brush and just put the indication of a few little highlights here in there don't overdo don't overdo just a little these are too far away to have a lot of detail in them too far away and cleaning the old brush quite often the thinner and let's go into this dark dark color we made dark looks black very dark it's a very dark green load at brush full let's go back up here that's a big tree that lives right there hmm yeah there he goes see as you go down push harder and harder with a brush use more of the brush when you first start to use only the corner but as you work down the tree then you're using more and more of the brush and there's nothing wrong with reloading the brush if you run out of paint go get some more you want this one dark so it stands out that's a big tree strong little tree there it comes there hmm I like to do these big evergreens and maybe there's a little one he's got a little friend it was right there there it is in your world but as many or as few trees as you want okay we can take touch of the dark sienna little bit of white cut us off a little roll of paint let's go right up here and with that well then we'll just put the indication of a happy little tree trunk there's one there's one right there go right into some of this lighter green color that's just yellow in the black but I want to keep it quite dark don't want this to get too bright okay let's go up here and we'll put some highlights on this old big tree now this tree is closer to you you'll see more highlights so you can add a little bit more color to this one a little bit more and we'll put a little on this small tree there we go there we go now same same old dark color or just fill this and we'll put it we'll put a happy little Bush in there any comes right out and we're going to have to add some reflections so we can just start drawing in some color for some nice reflections VanDyke Brown on the knife let's build look here a happy little stone gotta have a place for all this to sit this is just fan deck Brown decide where you want us to third area to be drunk the dentists you will go back to some of a dark sienna and white hailer that let's lay in a few little highlights so you just let this sort of bounce across there just like you're laying slow on the mountain that easy and you can take the little edge of the knife and just pull some of this down make it look like nice and banks grab it grab it pull down and go across and instant reflections and then take a one inch brush let's go through some CAD yellow and some SAP green CAD yellow and SAP green pretty pretty colors load a lot of paint into the brush let's go maybe right here lives a happy little tree there he is okay not that one right there and just put as many or as few as you want these things just grow wherever makes them happy all right a bit of liquid right and we'll cut us and a little water line underneath this this is how you sort of clean up the bottom bring everything together scratch in a few sticks and twigs now let's go over here on the other side I'll just use the same old dark color we use a round brush here we'll put a big tree he lives back in there somewhere and without cleaning the brush add a little bit of a lighter green color just to make the indication of a couple little highlights so round brush dust fantastic little background trees okay yeah we can take us a fan brush with Van Dyck Brown on it and we'll put in a big tree that lives hmm right there Van Dyck Brown give him a little friend soon and we need some nice little bushes around his foots and bring all this together like so mmm brown and white color with a knife we'll put the indication of some highlights on this tree just some indications all right let's take some liquid black liner brush and put us the indication of some little lambs and however many this is just liquid black there now back to our one inch brush some of the dark color put some leaves out here wherever wherever there's more white cap all right then and then no highlight these is just yellow a lit a little bit of I'm gonna SAP green in then just drop these in I'll put a little bit on these just to brighten them up think ahead a little highlight on and down here we had a little a little bit of stone a little bit of ground there we go drop some highlight on it okay I think that that shows us how that painting was done and I think we're we're about at a closing point for this week look forward to seeing you next time from all of us here at happy painting god bless you
