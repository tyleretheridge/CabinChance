hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today you ready do a fantastic little painting good tell you what let's start out today and having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us and they'll come across as usual in the same orders we have them on the palette starting with a white and working around let me tell you what I've already done today today as you can plainly see we have a black canvas up here now we we get this by just taking a white canvas and covering it with black Jessel letting that dry completely then on top of that I've taken today and I've covered the whole canvas with a thin let me say that again a thin coat of liquid clear and then over top of that I've just put a tiny tiny bit of phthalo blue so we have liquid clear and then phthalo blue I put the clear on there only to make the blue go much easier and I want a very thin coat of the blue in there don't want a whole bunch today and I thought maybe today will do a fantastic little winter scene and I'll show you how easy that can be let's start out with a little titanium white just a small amount we use the one-inch brush but we could use any other thing to which brush should work just as well open since we picked this one up we will use it now then I'm going to make the indication here just happy little cloud things that are happening there and we just sort of going to bounce this around and let it play and just make all kinds of little shapes but always keep the brush moving I don't want a lot of color in one place and you can see that White's picking up all that beautiful blue that's underneath and these things will just happen if you paint with me before you know it I mentioned quite frequently when you're doing these black canvasses with a transparent color on them that if you put the color on before you start painting in front of someone and then you see then you start this and you take your brush and go into a little bit of white paint and then touch this people think it's magic because they won't understand why this is happening there we go and it really makes it it's a sensation when it happens people just go crazy over it so if you're ever out painting for someone think about these there are a lot of fun on the black canvases you'll find it color stands out much much more than a dozen white canvas just jumps out at you use that to your advantage I love these black canvases you can create some of the most striking effects and they're very simple to do this black gesso is one of the neatest things that I've ever came up with there know then see we left a lot of these holes in here though don't just cover it all up maybe spots now watch we'll take we'll take a good clean dry two-inch brush and let's just begin blending this together now you can blend this to any degree of lightness or darkness that you want the more that you work it and I'm just using the corner of the brush the more that you work this the darker it will become because it'll pick up that color it's underneath so you have to make a big decision right off in this painting how dark do you want your sky or how light and you can always go back and add more of the titanium white anytime that you desire and you can make it shoot you can make it so bright it hurts your eyes if you want to and that's an individual thing you make it anyway it makes you happy there we are so quick we have a very nice effective little sky and this very gently will blend the brushstrokes up but by putting this liquid clear on here then you can put a very very small amount of phthalo blue so when you put the white it's not it's not so bright blue that is hurts the eyes that way it's almost like a glaze on there tell you brighten let's have some fun let's take some black we're use some black a little Prussian blue lizard crimson Oh a little Van Dyke Brown what the heck doesn't matter whatever you want let's build us a little mountain in this one pull the pain out as flat as you can get it go right down here with a knife cut across and get that smaller in the paint lives right out of the end of the blade there we go turn right up in here you have to make a big decision see we start right in here decide where you want your mountain to live and all we're looking for is a nice top shape we're not worried about the bottom of the mountain or anything else at this point the only thing we're trying to do is get us a basic shape in here so make up a shape or look at mountains in your area or get a nice book it has mountains in it whatever mountains come in all shapes and sizes some big some small some dark sunlight they're like people they have personalities that are that are different and unique so when you make your mountain don't just try to copy this one take any kind of mountain that makes you happy they're all we're interested in once again is this nice edge up on top we don't care what's happening in here but scrape off all the excess paint now with a clean dry brush you wanna grab this and begin moving it you can literally pull this paint around the canvas is whipped from the clear and the color that we have on there so we can move this color if this was a dry canvas it'd be very difficult there's very little color on the canvas very little we have scraped it very hard and now we're brushing it out so all we have left on here is just basically a stain in the canvas very very little color there we go very little paint now today shoot let's have some fun today let's come up here we'll take a little white a little bit of white a little way I'll reach over here get a little dark sienna and put in there maybe even little Van Dyke's up to you we will make a color about like so whatever whatever and it very small roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife now to start making some decisions in here first thing you have to decide is where your lights coming from I think maybe today let's have the light coming from the left side but you can change that in your painting if you want it coming from the right doesn't matter I'll begin to think about little ideas and basic shapes and and how you want things to be in your world here see maybe there's a little thing it comes right down we don't know maybe it comes down like it there just sort of let it go maybe comes right on down mountains are a great deal of fun and mountains will teach you how to use the equipment teach you how to use the knife and that's that's fantastic if you learn to use this knife you can't believe what it'll do but you have to make friends with it you have to devote a little time to working with it but very quickly you'll be doing things with it too you didn't believe was possible to do with a big ol thing looks like a putty knife here there just begin thinking about the shapes that you want in there may be out here just a little indication but you barely touch the canvas allow the knife just to sort of freeze it to slide along just float through here the latest touch that you can come up with is just right absolutely just whisper absolutely whisper probably one of the biggest questions that I hear over and over yet that's why I can't make his paint break like this two things normally cause the problem either the paint is too thin because you need a very dry thick paint to do this or the other thing is applying too much pressure very little pressure a little bit right there want to just just enough a little light tweak right through there and then we can take we'll take a little while it'll white maybe a little of the Prussian blue little lizard crimson will make us a nice lavender color but very dark this is going to be the shadow so we want it to be quite dark once again our little roll of paint now then we can begin coming back in here and we don't want too much but here in there just put the indication of some little highlights that live in here that's very easy to get carried away with these once again we don't want too many just a few just a few keep them quite dark there and I you can begin putting in indications of individual little things in there all kinds of little things just wherever you think they should be just a few of them once again this will get too bright on you very easily so don't overdo it gets to feel good sometime and you just keep going and going and going and then it's then you have to go back and put your dark back in but you can do that too it's not a big deal you can go back and put your dark right back in there we go see there's a lot of different things happening up here in this mountain it's just not plain old mountain there's a lot of things maybe let me take a little bit of titanium white with a least little touch of phthalo blue in it just the least little touch just want to cool it off a little here just a little pull it out flat and once again our little roll of paint and maybe there's a little maybe there's some snow laser I didn't hear a little maybe a little glacier shoot who knows just be in thinking about the shape and form and how it would lay in there there yeah we just put it in very lightly a little bit more of the blue and white there and that blue gives it a sort of a cold feeling blues a very cool color so maybe it comes right down there so we don't know where it goes just let it sort of Bend around and play in there climbs up the side of it and go back into your Browns just sort of bring it all together it's unbelievable what you can make here back into the Browns as we get further down this mountain but see how that color stands out against that black background fantastic absolutely fantastic maybe I've been here we'll just a little too sharp for me break it up a little so it's not quite as sharp there okay and we can go back to our original dark color and just pull in a few very dark recessed shadow areas but very very dark so grab a little that color that I'm just sort of blend together but it's very dark say okay good and that you can make just unbelievable mountains but devote a little time to practicing should you will not believe what you can make them very soon there we go and here I'm just rubbing very hard just just push all that color right into the fabric there we go where this lets it come right on we don't know where that goes maybe I'll put a big tree right over there okay to leave that one fantastic mountain going right there and we can take a 2 inch brush and the least little touch of white paint titanium white least little touch all just barely touch it now I want to just begin blending a little that white I want to create the illusion of nice soft misty areas down here at the base so we take that white and just do little circles tiny little circles and we can tap that'll bring it all together there but you can create areas that are so misty and soft and quiet that easy there we go so easy to overdo once again color stands out so strong against this black that is very easy to overdo so don't don't get carried away yeah yeah we're not worried about the bottom I think I'll put some little trees down there what the heck trees if the base of the mountain are always very pretty and over in here we'll just tap a little just to soften right in here where they come together there now just like making clouds here you can put several layers if you want you can create the illusion of layers of mist laying here can do very easy just let your imagination take you wherever you want to go so all you have to do already know then let's get the OL knife let's take let's just use this dark color is use and that's the mountain color maybe maybe I'll add a little bit more black to them on it gray might be a little bit a little blue-black they loo blue and some Brown and crimson that's all it is there okay we wipe off of the knife so grab an old fan brush today this is a number 6 fan brush but the number three would work just as well and some people like a number three because it gives you maybe a little more control is a little smaller maybe back here in this mist we have some happy little trees that live back in here just the indication of little distant trees that are far away see how that little misty area we put in there that's the only thing that makes those little rascals pop out at you otherwise they would just hide back here in that dark area but because we put that little mist now they come alive another little trick you can do is take a little bit of light color doesn't matter what it is grab the bottom and lift upward make it look like hundreds of little tree trunks that are far away back here and a sneaky huh that's a lazy way of putting in a bunch of tree trunks very simply and then I have several fan brushes going so we're just taking a little mix up some color here we'll take some white some throw blue now I want to make several different grades or of this so we'll take white here and I'll just bring a little that into it so now we have a much darker value up here than down here but it's all the same color so we can have different variations of the same color in one power I clean off my knife okay we'll grab another fan brush as I say I have hair several of them going here that one's clean so we'll use him take a little that blue just load it into the bristles a little bit of the light color see there's all kinds of things happening in there's not one dead old color maybe right in here there's some bigger trees they live they live right about here and I push upward today see give it a little upward push we can make just all kinds of heavy live evergreens these are a little bigger they're a little closer to us make a decision how many live in your world and drop them in just push upward with a corner of the fan brush though maybe there's a little one lives right here and this is just playing lights against dark darks against light etc etc and that's what gives you all these beautiful little effects now when you're doing this make a decision once again decide how many trees live in your world here and just pop them in maybe back in here we'll put some little bushes right here at the base of this see they're just Park and smooth but all I'm doing is pushing up or to the fan brush so all there is to it and have it I want to create some mist at the base of these little trees I'll take two-inch brush and very firmly tapping with a top corner of the brush just tap those trees and you can distort that to fuse it it'll create that an illusion of mist and right on the base of this we can do the same thing if we want you can just make all kinds of beautiful little misty effects that easy there we go now she will just use that same old brush doesn't matter we'll go right into titanium white with it genna's put some titanium white on it there we are like so now that decide where your snow is going to live let's come right here we can watch right in here okay now just pull see just make a big decision give it a pull wherever you want it to go it has super way to put some snow in your pain it's that easy though and easy once again look how this stands out against that black purcha if you're not careful it just stands right out there maybe maybe there's a little river or something that lives in our painting make a decision where you think it lives pull it down straight down okay now take a clean brush this is clean and very dry you sure it's clean and dry that's mixing with the blue that's underneath here very gently go across and that quick we have instant reflections of a nice shimmer on the water okay maybe maybe let me find another fan brush there it is I knew I had one somewhere here we'll take the blue and the white just mix them together maybe there's a larger evergreen tree that lives here in our world I want to add a little dark color to that too just to dull it a little there we go a little black into it just to dull it down oh that's nice that's nice don't it too bright maybe our tree lives right there just make the decision put it in once again we're going to take the corner of the brush and begin pushing upward sometimes we make evergreen trees by pushing down with a brush sometimes upward just sort of depends on how you mood is look around the trees your area see how they look or how you're feeling that day whatever they're individuals just like paper so you make them any way that you want there just want to show you different ways of making them and you you decide maybe some little grassy things coming down through here I don't know now we can take the fan brush and begin making big decisions where all this leaves very gently barely touching just caress the canvas smooth all that out see here that comes will make a distinct little Peninsula that comes right down to the water there there like so but just barely touching you can make this so smooth it looks like silk or you can leave it a little rough sup to you up to you now you know me always thank these are such beautiful places to live maybe let's have a little cabin lives right here easiest way that I found make a cabin is start a scraping out a basic shape this does two things first of all it allows you to layout your cabin without being committed maybe most important it removes the excess paint and that makes your life a lot easier find me a spot to work pick some van Dyck Brown and let's go right up here we do the back eve all we have it brown we can just fill this in all we're doing here is just blocking in color that's really all we're doing just blocking in color we're not committed we're not worried about it just putting some color on the canvas now then put a roof a little white there it is see how easy that is you can do that there it's all you have to just drop it in pay attention to your angles up angles are very important when you're doing buildings okay little snow on the other side there we are cute little house take a little brown and white bear to touching the canvas up make us look like old wood tired of wooden now on the other side if you put anything over here at all very dark very dark because it's gonna be in shadow okay maybe tell you what I have a little door here so that's all you got to do take a little cutter on the knife a little dark color you can cut through make indication of some boards will do a cabin ectomy hmm there you go just cut it off to whatever size you want that is easy with our fan brush come back in here a little snow down here you at the bottom take a little blue and white like the indication maybe of a little path coming after I don't know whatever just make up little stories in your mind maybe there's an old trapper lived here maybe one day he maybe fell off in here in the river true who knows wait on them tell you what let's get crazy let's take some dark color we'll take some black some phthalo blue Prussian blue lizard crimson it don't matter as long as it's good dark color them two inch brush you know me I love these old big trees let's do a big tree let's go right over here on this left side maybe in our world lives a big tree right there I'm doing the same way I did a little let's take the corner in the brush just give it little upward pushes all there is to it see there think about shape and form don't just hit it random though and you can create a beautiful tree just using this great big old brush so all there is to it egg tree let's go on the other side we don't want it left out maybe this tree over here is a monster maybe it will clean off the canvas all right we can do that too we have no limits to our world only limited by your imagination only limited by your imagination and the good Lord puts no boundaries on that so we can go anywhere we want to go with our imagination don't even have to see your friendly travel agent for that there anywhere you want to go maybe this tree lives right out here shoot right in front of our house there we go just coming right over like that that pushes that cabin way back here in the woods maybe maybe there's some bushes and stuff to live down in here now then without cleaning the brush I'm just going to go into a little touch of white and phthalo blue now then go right back up here and very lightly decide where your highlights are and just push upward the same way but don't over do you want this tree to stay quite dark and just put in the indication of a few happy little highlights here and there there see there and that's something there's some right here okay and we go on the other side and give this little tree something we don't want that left out there he is but still thinking about shapes and form and all those hefty little things that go on in there it's most most important now back to our fan brush let's put over here so you can use this fan brush maybe there's big stones and stuff all underneath here we don't know where it is see you can put all kinds of things by just jiggling and wiggling that brush looks like this this is rough so a dog said me set down the sand paper said rough on the other side a little touch right there when I can and then a fantastic lady to a beautiful little winter scene put a few little finishing touches in there shoot that son of a guns all done hope you've enjoyed this one it'll really give you give you a nice painting to do so I think we'll call that one finished him from all of us here happy painting and god bless my friend you you
