"Hi. I'm certainly glad to see you today. I thought maybe today we'll just do a fantastic
little seascape, a little easy one that you can do. Let's start out and they'll run all the colors
across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you
what I've got up here. Today I have regular old eighteen by twenty
four inch double prime, pre-stretched canvas and I've taken a piece of contact paper or
any adhesive back paper and just cut an oval, stuck it right on the canvas and I've covered
the inside of it with black gesso. "
"We allowed the black gesso to dry completely and then we came back and I put a little piece
of tape right here so I'll have a straight horizon. From here up, I've covered it with liquid
clear, very thin coat and taken phthalo blue and put here. From here down, liquid clear, phthalo blue
and phthalo green. I want the water to have a little green cast
to it so I've put a little phthalo green in the bottom. Otherwise it's just phthalo blue all over. "
"We put the liquid clear on there though because it makes that color so much easier to put
on and it's almost like a glaze. I don't want to much so let's have some fun. We'll start out with a little tiny two inch
brush and a little bit of titanium white on it. I don't need much, just a small amount. Something about like that. Okay. Now then, we'll go up in here and very gently
begin making our little criss cross strokes. Now this is a fantastic painting to do for
friends and relatives and don't tell them you've put color up here and they just see
you take white paint and start doing this and all of these gorgeous, gorgeous colors
appear and they'll think it's magic. "
"There we go. Don't tell them any different, that's our
secret. Shh. All right, there we go. Just want a little background color. I'm going to come in here and put in some
big old clouds but I'm looking for a little background color now, that's all. That's all. There we are. See, just make little cross criss strokes
like that and very lightly go over it. Now you can make this as light as you want
it just by adding white. I don't want it to be to light though because
I'm going to put some clouds that I want to show up but if you wanted it lighter, just
take a little more of the white and go right in there, put it in. Okay. "
"Now then, I'm going to clean the brush because I want it to be nice and fresh and put some
more white on it. Shake it off and just beat the devil out of
it. Now then, I'm going back into titanium white. Just going to tap some into the bristles,
it don't matter how you load it. Shoot, any old way you can get it on there. Let's go up in here and maybe our little clouds,
maybe they just live, just taking the corner of the brush and making little circular patterns. See? Just take the top corner and make little circular
patterns. "
"That's all we're looking for. There. Load a little more color on the brush and
our whirl, yup, you're right. There's another little cloud, lives right
there. Work in layers though. Do one cloud at a time so you've got a darker
edge here than you do at the top of this one. That's what we're looking for. Now then, let me grab our little blender brush. Very, very soft hair, very soft. Just caresses the canvas, very gentle, very
gentle. See there? Then you can blend right over that. Lift it, fluff it and you can take it to any
degree of brightness that you want and that's all we need to make a little cloud. "
"I'm going to blend this a little in here, just blending the bottom of it. Now this blender brush has a round handle
so it's easy to spin around and to make all these little things happen. There. Very lightly, just barely grazing the canvas. Okay. Now a little more white. I want another cloud in my world. I think, yup, you're right. Here comes one but we finish those that are
behind it first and then come along and put the ones here in the foreground. There they are, a little more color. Okay, look at that but you can make clouds
with just a big old two inch brush and a little blender brush. That's all it takes. "
"Shoot, or you can do it with a fan brush, it doesn't matter. Whatever. There. Okay, back to my little blender and there
we go. Yeah, just blend it a little bit like that. Something like so. Okay, then we'll fluff it a little and off
we go. There. Okay and as I say, in your world, you put
as many layers of clouds as you want or as few, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Shoot, maybe we'll put one more right down
here at the horizon. There. The only thing that little piece of tape does
there, it'll make your horizon nice and straight, nice and straight and that's very nice sometime. There we are. "
"See, let me grab my little blender brush and we'll just blend that right together again. I say, this little blender brush, as my father
used to say, it's tender as a mother's love. It's a very soft little brush. I asked them to make this one for me because
the other one's sort of, they're a little stiffer for working with that old tough, hard
paint and this allows us to do something's that we couldn't with the other one. There. Very soon, Annette's going to have her flower
book out and she's going to show you how to make fantastic flowers with this. There. All right. Okay. That easy. We got a pretty good looking little sky. There. All right. "
"Now let's carefully take off this little piece of tape here and see, we have a very
straight horizon there, that easy and we can take a clean brush and just push a little
bit of that color right up to the horizon because there was no color, no paint right
under the tape. Now there is. There we go. Now we have color all the way up there. I just wanted an excuse to wash the brush. There we are. Okay. I have to make some big decisions in our world. Let me grab a fan brush. Maybe back in here, let's take some phthalo
blue, a crimson, make a nice lavendary color. There. Both sides of the brush, full of color, a
little more crimson. There, that's good. "
"Let's go up in here. Maybe there's a big old, what do they call
them? Headlands, foot lands, headlands that comes
out here like that. Big old rocket projects out into the water,
there. Far away though. Not looking for a lot of detail in this one,
it's to far away. Big rascal though, he lives back there, way
back in the distance somewhere. All right. There he comes. Let's see now, this is a very simple little
seascape we're going to do today. Even if you haven't painted many, this one
you can do. I'll take a little red, a little bit of that
yellow we had and just sort of mix them together. Red and yellow, make a little orangey color. Just sort of to highlight that a little bit. "
"I don't want a lot of detail back here because in that detail, it'll absolutely destroy our
illusion of distance and make it look like it's far away so don't overdo this. Put a few little things in here and there
and let it go at that. Let it go at that. There. See there? This is a little place that you can come to
walk down here and get right up against the ocean and look at it and watch the dolphins
play. I live in Florida and I spend a lot of time
in Daytona Beach and there's some of the most gorgeous little dolphins there that play and
the manatees. "
"If you've never seen a manatee, they're one of the neatest little animals. Not little animals now that I think about
it, they're huge but they're the most gentle creature God's ever made I think. Gorgeous things. There. Little white, just a sparkle that here and
there. There. Okay, we'll wash that old brush. Now maybe in our world there's some water
back there. We'd better make a big decision though. We have to decide if we're going to have a
little crash or wave in here, where it's gonna live. Put a little white on the filbert, get right
up in here. "
"Now let's take and let's decide. Maybe our little crasher wave's way back in
the back and I like to just sort of take the brush and put in a basic little shape here
so I know about where he's going to be and I can paint around him a little bit. Let's just say he's right there. That's just to give us a little idea of where
our wave's going to live. Okay. Get the old brush dried off a little there. I'm just drying that brush on a little paper
towel. Okay, back to our fan brush. Now then. Back in here, there's going to be some other
waves that are just living. "
"Just decide where you think they are, put in some basic little shapes way back in here. I'm just going to touch and start. Let me exaggerate. I'm making motions like that but I'm exaggerating,
they're much smaller. Automatically it begins to give the appearance
of little waves way back in the background there. We know this one here is going to come over
like that so we can go ahead and put some of that in there just to give us an idea. Make those little noises, think about water
crashing. Here it comes, toom, just let it shooomp,
fall over. "
"Now then with a clean fan brush, I want to grab some of that little color. This fan brush is clean because I just want
to pull some of that back. We're going to come back with a little liner
brush and put in some little details but this is just pulling some of that color back on
this black canvas. This black gesso is wonderful for doing things
like this, just absolutely wonderful. Look at that. That color just jumps out at you, it's exciting
and already, you're beginning to see the little choppiness of the water back there. Isn't that neat? "
"All right, wash the old brush off. Now then, I have to start making some big
decisions. I'm going to take some white, put a little
touch, a little touch, a little touch of the cad yellow in it, a little touch so we got
white and yellow. I'm using a number three fan brush. You could use the filbert or number six, whatever,
it's up to you. I'm just going to roughly, real strong, scrub
in some color right there. I want this to be the eye of the wave. Let it sort of twinkle off like that. Now you can do that several times to make
it brighter, just to make it brighter like so. "
"Now I'm going back to my little blender brush, the one that's so soft and come right up in
here. Use just the corner of it and just begin blending
that. Blend it, blend it, blend it. I mean, you could make this look as soft as
silk, so gorgeous. Just blend it. Notice the hair is hardly turning, it's the
handle that's just going around in circles with. Soft, soft, soft, right on out to nothing. There. Something like that and then we just blend
it right on out. Isn't that a beautiful color? THat's just phthalo green, phthalo blue under
there and a little white and yellow you put on top of it. That's all. Now let's redefine this a little bit. "
"I want that just to crash right over. We don't want it just perfectly straight. This old wave's having a hard time in his
life. Back to our filbert. I'm going to take a little bit of lavender
so that's just a little alizarin crimson, a little phthalo blue mixed together. Put a little on the filbert brush here about
like that and let's go right up in here and with that, let's put some nice foamy things
that are happening. It helps to make those little noises. Your friends will look at you like you're
a little strange but that's all right. "
"Painters are expected to be a little different so it's all right. It's all right and those little noises, they
really help me. I don't know if they help you but they help
me sort of in my mind see these little things. Okay, let me wipe the old brush and clean
it off. There. Now I'm going back into the titanium white
and right above that, I'm going to do the same thing. I want those nice sparkly little edges right
up on top of that foam. Here they come, there. Give it a little push, bend it, there we go. You could do this to with a fan brush. "
"Today I thought I'd do it with a filbert but it's up to you. Put in just some basic little splashes. We'll go back, get our little soft blender
brush, very gently. This is where this little brush really works
miracles because you can go right over this wet, thick paint without it all blending together
and you can just soften that, just as delicate, look at that. Look at that. Just using the corner of this little blender
though, so soft, so gentle. Look at there. Oh, I get excited, it's pretty. All right. "
"Now then, let's find us a knife here. I think we'll have some stones out here in
our water. I think we need a stone or two. Back up a little bit, take a look see and
decide where the stone lives in your world. Right here we have a nice stone. Just Van Dyke brown. I won't get crazy. Van Dyke brown. There's a little dark sienna in there too. Maybe there's another stone here. We'll just have that wave crashing back here. There. Take a little bright red, a little dark sienna
and mix them together. All right. "
"A little touch of white in it, just to brighten it up a little. Now then, very gently just let the knife graze
gently. Just put a few little highlights on this stone
so it stands out here. See there? Decide where they live in here, there. Just vary, I'll put a little lavender in there. I'm going to vary some of the colors. Just let the knife bounce and play. Make it look like old, tough, mean rocks that
live out there. I say now, once again, seascapes sometimes
will give you a hard time but this one is one that you can do. It's a nice little rascal, it's not to hard
and the black canvas, it makes it so much better, so much easier. "
"A little bit right out there and this one's going to be a colorful one. I want some color today, it's a wonderful
day and color makes you feel good, just makes you feel good. Let me wash my little brush here, small fan
brush. Put a little paint thinner. I'm going to right in to a little titanium
white. Be right back, get a little phthalo blue in
it, there, a little phthalo blue and maybe in our world, I put a little paint thinner
in there so it would be just a little thinner and now we can just flow that right over the
top so it looks like water's just flowing all through there. "
"There. A little bit, maybe there's water dripping
all through here because if this rock was out here with all this going on, I'm telling
you there would be water dripping off of it everywhere. See it? There it comes, there it comes, going right
on out here. We need some on this old big rock over here
too. Waves are crashing on it, splashing and carrying
on. Yeah. All kinds of things happen to it, just let
that flow right off there. Shoot, maybe in our world, maybe there's even
water coming from way up. I don't know. Now if you have a lot of time, try doing this
with a liner brush because you can put in a lot more detail, a lot more detail when
you have a lot of time. "
"Least little touch of the white on the brush here and let's make a big decision. Maybe there's something that lives right there
and we just blend it back. There. See? Right up in between there, there we go. Isn't that color something else? I love these black canvases because color
just appears. Excuse me, I get excited about this. I'm sorry. There. See? Just blend it back and what you're trying
to save is the dark areas. You could really care less about the rest
of it. It's the dark areas you're trying to save. They become the goodies in between. Maybe there's another one right in here, just
all kinds of little things are happening. See there? Keep these strokes pretty flat though. "
"There. I know, we'll have a stone right up in the
front so let's not worry. Let me find my liner brush. Put it into a little paint thinner, we'll
go into a little bit of that light blue and let's begin highlighting some of these little
things, putting all kinds of doers in there. Now these are the things that will make your
painting special. Spend a lot of time working with these. All these little foam patterns that happen
in here. Here sometimes they come down but they begin
creating form and shape in here, all those little things. Okay. Back in here, see, they just climb right up,
that's what shows it's shape. "
"A little darker color right on the brush, sort of outline that. That will make it stand out and then bring
some of them back. A little fish plays in there sometime. There. Now I'm going to go right into that yellow
and white mixture and let's brighten some of these back here. Let's just begin to brighten some of those,
make them shine in the sun. There. See there? All of those little things, they just play
in there and have fun and maybe light's coming right through here and right there, just think
where light would come in. Put some little highlights in there. It makes your painting shine, makes it exciting. People will look at it. "
"Not that we're interested in selling paintings but color a lot of times sells a painting
as well as content. There we go. Just let those little rascals happen. We said we was going to put a stone down here,
didn't' we? I just keep messing around, putting all these
in. Okay, I'll put a stone down there. Take a little Van Dyke brown, a little bit
of black into it. I want it a strong stone maybe. Old stone just lives right here on the edge,
something like that. Take a little bit of that highlight color,
just let it sort of bounce along here, play a little bit and then come back with our phthalo
blue, drip a little water over it. We gotta have a little water on it. "
"Everything in here should be wet. There. Then we can pull a little bit back in here,
back to my liner brush. I'm just sort of jumping back and forth here
as I see things. There we go. Bring it back and we have some little doers
in here like so, all kinds of little things. I say when you're at home and you have unlimited
time, you can just get in here and put all these little rascals in. They are so gorgeous. All right. Something like that but seascapes can be one
of the most fun things to paint. The black canvas will give you a whole new
dimension in seascapes that normally you don't have. "
"All right. You could take a little touch, we'll just
use a little black, a little black and we can go up here and maybe in our world there's
maybe like a little M bird. I call them M's because it's like making M's. A little seagull that's way back here in the
distance, I'll give 'em three. Momma, Poppa and the little baby one. I'll take a little bit more of that phthalo
blue. I want to just put a few little drippy downs
on here. Phthalo blue and titanium white, just for
the little drippy downs where water's going. That helps form your rock, there but the paint
needs to be very thin because you have a lot of paint up here so put a lot of paint thinner
with it, a lot of paint thinner just makes it flow right off there, something like that. "
"We need some over on the other side. Don't want him left out. About like that. Wherever you think they should be but that's
basically a nice way of doing a very effective little seascape. I think the moment of truth is here though. Let's bring the camera up and take the old
contact paper off here. Take a look and see if we need to peddle around
with anything. Look at that, there it comes but isn't that
a nice way of doing a little seascape? Shoot, I tell you what let's do, let's just
load a little bit of bright red on here. We'll just sign this one, call it done but
when you're painting seascapes, give this black gesso a try. "
"I think you're going to find it one of the most exciting mediums that you've ever ran
into. It will paint half your painting for your
before you even get started. I think in one of the paintings we showed
you how you could use the gesso to do under paintings and then just come back and glaze
them, it works for this too. Give it a try. I'd love to hear from you, I'd love to see
some photos of your success. From all of us here, I'd like to wish you
happy painting and God bless my friend. "
