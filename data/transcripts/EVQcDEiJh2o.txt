welcome back certainly glad you could join me today and today I'd like to introduce you to some little friends that I have with me this is four little chimney sweeps and they're just sort of hanging right here on my shirt these are the cutest little devils and they live in attendance oh you're that one that's hungry here and a lot of people here I'm in the chimney but not too often do you give chance to see them and believe it or not in this mess of birds here there are four of them there's one hidden under there and their little babies just a couple of weeks old I thought you might enjoy seeing these I borrowed these from Diana Schaeffer the bird lady here in Muncie to show you so I tell you what let's haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me today and while they're doing that I'll see if I can get these Rascals off my shirt and we'll get started here this is like pulling leeches off so we just take them right off they have unbelievable little claws come out there we go yeah let's say you don't have to worry about them falling all right okay today I have a standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas up here this is a triple primed canvas so it's all ready to go and I've covered it with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white so it's wet and slick and we can get started they think it's time to eat let's have some fun today let's start off the day with a little touch of the CAD yellow just a small amount on the brush just just sort of tap the bristles into it so you get a little tiny bit we don't want to overload it just a little bit okay let's go right up here and this is such a fantastic day let's do just a beautiful happy little painting put a little tiny bit of this yellow into the sky just a small amount just somewhere right along in there now then without cleaning the brush I want to add a little touch of the yellow ochre and we'll put a little touch of that in there just let them blend together just happy little colors they make you feel good they're nice and bright warm colors have it maybe let's still without cleaning the brush because I'm lazy I look for easy ways to do things a little of alizarin crimson just a small amount right down in here well just to add a little touch of crimson we're just making little crisscross strokes little axis solvers to it and just allow these colors to blend together just blend right together maybe even a little bit of that crimson up in here wherever you want to just sort of look around and decide where you think it should live in your painting hope you enjoy the little birds and stuff that we show on the program I'm such a fanatic for god's little creatures that i like to share those with you there we are then maybe we have a little light spot right here so I tell you what maybe I'll just take my finger and take a little touch of that crimson just a very small amount of paint it will just put the indication of a little Sun up in there we can take the big brush and blend it and this will soften it to any degree of lightness or darkness that you want you can just soften it until it goes away if you want to we want to keep a little tiny bit of it there just enough that there's a little indication yeah put some little clouds up there and for that I'm gonna take some alizarin crimson and a touch just a touch of the phthalo blue now the phthalo blue is many many times stronger than the crimson so proportionately we're using much much more crimson and then we are blue be very careful that blue is so strong and it'll eat up your whole world in a heartbeat now we just take the old large brush I still haven't cleaned it still haven't cleaned it just tap a little color into it and it may be up in here leave something nice just happy little stringy clouds across here now if you was to use blue by itself to do this and you touch the yellow oh my gosh well you know what it happens you'd have bright green and in this particular painting I'm not looking for a green sky so by using this lavender color if when you hit the yellow the worst that can happen is it turns a beautiful brownish color and that's okay we can live with that today maybe just one right in here you have to make big decisions of where does your little clouds live they just float around and have fun all day there is another one as many or as few as you want let's go to the side over here we have a few coming in here little stringy clouds there I just sort of stair-step this one maybe it comes right on down might go right up to the Sun there just right up to it and a little bit right along here this will this will be our horizon read along this area so we just put a little color right here wherever you want it okay now long last will wash the brush and we wash our brush with odorless thinner shake off the excess and then just beat the devil at it that's the most fun part of this whole technique take out all your frustrations and hostilities be sure your brush is good and dry barely touching barely touching three hairs and some air just gently blend the sky and you blend it to any degree of softness that you want you can continue to blend it until it's just too soft as velvet or you can leave it quite strong it's up to you it's up to you painting is a very individual thing so you have to make big decisions in your world there now then okay let's take that same color we'll just add a little bit more to the two-inch brush it's the hanging old brush just a little bit of color maybe back in here mm somewhere in here maybe there's a happy little Hill that lives back here I wanted almost the same color as this guy very soft very subdued it's far away far far away don't let it get too strong on your to stand out we want this to be we off the distance somewhere far away far far away there so you need now here we are here to see our camera crew there now we can soften that just sets we back here now then let's have some maybe some little grassy areas in there shoot way don't take we just use that same color I'm going to add a little Van Dyke Brown to it maybe a little black just want to darken up a little bit but the same lavender color with a little Van Dyne with a black mixed just so it's darker and let's begin tapping in some basic little shapes here maybe there's a little hill there's right there maybe it comes down just make a decision you have unlimited power here you can create any illusion that you can conceive in your mind so just allow that to happen allow it to happen there we are again thinking about where you want all these little things to live see now you can see how distant that Hill looks it really doesn't show up well do you put something in front of it there and we're always playing darks against light lights against dark continually continue the finest paint made can only capture a small portion of light so we have to work with illusions and then you paint you play once again with lights against dark darks against light there we go okay so quickly we have some background filled in here and you could really just wipe this on this is just a super way to practice you could put this on with a paint roller all we're doing is just blocking in some basic color here there okay same old brush I'm not even gonna clean it I'm gonna go right down here pick up a little bit of the yellow a little yellow ocher little Indian yellow here and there we'll get the least little touch of the bright red not much not much maybe I'll be right back get a little touch of the darks in here just to dull it a little so it's not too bright a little touch a SAP green - ooh that's getting nice but by loading it on the brush and mixing color on the brush in this brush now we have a multitude of colors happening it's not one flat oded color and you push that brush give it a little push that loads paint right on the end of the bristles and with that then we can go up here and very lightly begin tapping in some beautiful little grassy hills started in the area there's feathers too away from you and work forward forward forward always coming forward now maybe watch here see maybe it comes right down see now you created a different plane there that's simple that simple what power you have there we go and I'm just gonna vary these same colors back and forth little darker there's a little more the sap green but just very him back and forth the forth and back but now the lay of the land begins to become very important so begin thinking about how the land flows the little hills and the valleys and all these beautiful little things in here are you doing just happy and the more you tap the softer it becomes hmm you can hear the little birds in the background there yeah they just chirp it and having a good tap yeah there is something else there's nothing else in the last series we we showed a baby owl and later on in this series I'm going to show you what he he grew up to be because he's he's a big alan out there but see just layer after layer after layer in as many and as few as you want now sometimes sometimes sometimes you get excited and you see nice things here maybe you want to show I'm taking a little bit of that just straight titanium white maybe there you want to show a little light singing through here so just add a little white to your brush and where you think light would hit just tap a little in there but don't overdo if you overdo then it loses its effectiveness it's effective only because there's a small amount of it it's like gold if everybody had a lot of gold it wouldn't be worth anything so treasure these little things don't don't use them don't use them all up there good friends okay tell you one shoot that's such a nice place there there would be a beautiful place to have just a happy little pond let's take another two-inch person I have several of each brush going so I don't have to continually wash brush then we had a little touch of the phthalo blue and maybe have to make a decision maybe we have a little tiny body of water here we back here pull it straight down just straight down and don't worry about this if there's something here that you don't want or don't like all you have to do is cover it up let's see how beautiful that is with that lavender that's underneath it mixes with it don't fight these things allow them to happen it can be some of the most beautiful effects now very lightly go across just enough to give it a sheen or watery appearance that's all it takes man maybe back in here let's make take a little white a little white a little dark Sienna like so just white and dark Sienna pull it out as flat as you can get it but leave it marble so there's a lot of color is happening pull across get our tiny little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife and maybe there's a little bit of land back here just to though and all I'm doing is scrubbing just so we really scrub it in yeah all right now maybe maybe our land continues get a little more in the brown little black a little alizarin crimson and little touch of blue all the same colors again maybe this is a very small little pond here so maybe maybe maybe let's have it come right along here so not much of it shows we just want to indication there's a place back here for all the creatures can go get a little drink okay but this again puts another plane in the painting and each one of these planes helps create that illusion of depth and distance and to me that's very very desirable in a painting there we go tell you what I just tell you what let's take a little dark sienna and white we just use that same will brush leave whatever's on there with it thank you we just put some of this color on like it look at all the beautiful colors that happen because you don't clean the brush if you cleaned it and started with fresh color you'd have one dead old color as it is you're picking up everything it's there and it's all mixing together and just beautiful things are happening go back to this brush it has the yellows on the greens on it tap and a little bit of color this tap give it that little push see how that loads the end of those bristles most important there we go it's surprising little ponds like this sometimes just the fishing here can be fantastic when I was a kid I used to fish in little ponds like this all over Florida caught some pretty nice fish I remember when that was only about nine or ten years old I was looking for some fish meat one day I'm one of the big guys in the neighborhood tell me they don't the larvae out of a wasps nest makes beautiful fish pee which it does it does I said well I don't know how to catch you how to kick them so this guy told me he says now if you want to catch if you want to get a wasps nest to get the little RV out for fish bait what you do is find a big one and then you take a pole and you suck it and when it falls down you run and grab it but in the meantime all these wasps are gonna come so if you stand real still like a tree they'll think you're a tree and they won't bother you but at nine years old made sense to me so I went out and got a big pole and knocked biggest wasps nest in town down and stood real still and these wasps use my face for an aircraft carrier they came in like jets team and my eyes literally swells shut he's on in the bed didn't do any fishing for a long time so if anybody tells you that don't believe it you're gonna knock a wasp nest down if you run there we go I look like a little road there so let's just put something on this site that easy and we're using the same old colors crimson and brown little touches of blue all we're doing is just applying a dark color so we put a lighter color on there it'll show I have to have dark in order to show light while we get that going tell you what I see something else here I see something else same old colors maybe right in here most air using this old brush maybe their lives in here to help what it does now maybe their lives in here a big tree nice tree it's a friend nut tree there we go I'm just using the corner of the brush and just tapping in here a very basic little shape I'm not looking for any detail at this point in a minute and a minute we'll find some details in it but right now we're just looking looking for a nice tree shape someplace for that little noisy bird to stay there okay maybe comes right on down here we don't know a nice little Bush lives here whatever you want just have to make a decision and drop it in okay yeah I'm gonna take some of the liquid white put it out here take a little yellow ocher little dark sienna not much just a little maybe a little more the dark sienna mix it all up there now this is very thin paint let me clean my knife then to clean the knife we'll take our liner brush we're going to some paint thinner I'll go into Van Dyck Brown then we get a little more thinner we want this to be very thin paint so we load the bristles full of Van Dyck Brown okay now I'm going to just go right down here now take word we have this liquid white with color in it pull one side of it only through so you have a light side and a dark side see yeah let's go up in here and this build is a trunk in there that's all they put a little more color the dark little the light yet to be careful that your lights always on the same side and getting nervous let it wiggle and jiggle and have fun put some character in that tree don't just make an old street tree these are so much more interesting when they have some shape and gnarly I like it word gnarly yeah tell you what we've used this old 2 inch brush so much let's just add a little bit of green satin grain little kid yeah a little yellow ochre Indian yellow what have you got there tap a little color into it now the yellow paint is thinner than other colors we intentionally make that too a thinner consistency so it'll stick because yellows nerd it always the highlight color now using just the corner that big old 2 inch brush you can begin placing in all kinds of beautiful little leaf indications think about form and shape it's the most important don't just throw them in at random there we go see but that easy using a big old brush you can make a beautiful tree beautiful trim going into a little yellow ocher maybe in here there's another little bush that counts a few little individual things there and touch the brain read to it and sparkle it up a little there we go maybe he's got a little friend that lives over here named Clyde or whatever a little more yellow there then it'll stand out there you see just changing the color a little and then you have layer after layer of bushes that easy maybe there's a little Bush lives right here there okay good take the point of the knife and just scrape through put in a few little sticks and twigs I tell you I tell you what that's such a beautiful little place we're to have a little house there let's build a little house maybe the little house here's the roof coming right here I scrape it out first that sort of helps you lay it out like so maybe it's a porch beyond a porch all you gotta do is pull out down out the house go there right there and we're not committed yet all we're doing is just putting in a basic idea there but it lays out your whole cabin and at the same time it allows you to remove some of that excess paint I'm gonna take a little white a little touch a little touch a sailor blue a little touch of black just a little thanks so okay let's build us a roof on there you'll earn a little roll of paint here's a little trick I don't line it first with a knife and then when you come down then you have a nice straight edge like so just let it go it's an old house here maybe this is some place some place in the deep south I was born and raised in Florida so I like these southern scenes let's just put old southern tight pasture it's old - I mean it's seen its better day a little bit over here on this side thanks so now then maybe maybe this little house maybe it has like a screen porch on it so that just sort of looks and dark yeah sorta looks dark they all porch there we are yeah take off let's take white least little touch of least little touch of black in it and a little touch of dark sienna just to dull it down real nice okay and then over here maybe just a touch more of the CN in there so it shows up a little bitter there we go there okay and Divya that'll shed a little brown under here just to create a little shadow maybe a little bit running right down there yeah we'll take it same color and add a little white to it so it'll be a little bit brighter and underneath our porch out here there we go just let that slide right down through there we can take a little brown and just put the indication here in there of some nice boards hmm maybe you can make out here and there a few little things the rail that runs right along here okay yeah it's a little bit hard to see it I want this edge where they come together here to be a little darker so it shows there and just pull it down so it blends right in okay yeah then let's go back to a big brush the bushes here growing up this guy cuts grass like I do which aren't too good I'm not a very good line keeper so we'll just have a few bushes growing up around his old house like so and sometimes you can just get crazy here maybe tell you what maybe take a little brown maybe there's what remains of an old fence and then maybe maybe what I have it starting right there just goes right along the road here because because if you had a beautiful pond like it there probably be a trout in there and everybody'd be after your trout little brown and white so we'll put up a little fence to keep them out now right through the liquid white and let's just take use the heel of the knife and cut in the indications of a little bit of wire how many strands you want to 310 it's up to you that easy you can just drop them in no problem at all little bit of color come right down in here put a little grass at the footage of these and then we can take her big brush playing that little Panther right it just the way we wanted over on this side here we need we need a little bit of grassy things same greens and stuff and we'll tap in just a few little things there we are this sort of reminds me though place I grew up in Florida because it was very quiet had a few Hills there are a few places in Florida that have a few little Hills when we were kids we thought those were mountains years later I never suspected I didn't definite living in Alaska let's see some of the most beautiful mountains in the world okay I'll tell you what I think we bad have a finished painting take a little bit of thinner a little touch of the bright red and we'll sign this one I hope you've enjoyed it and once again I hope you enjoyed the little critters that we had on the beginning of the show I certainly enjoy bringing them to you so from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and god bless you
