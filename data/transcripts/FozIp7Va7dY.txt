- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. It's a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you're at. Let's start out then and have them run all of the colors across the screen that you'll need to paint along with us. And I thought today we'd do the little opening painting that you see that Jerry Morton put
together that's so fantastic. So, tell you what I've got going up here. Got my standard old 18 x 24 inch canvas and it's covered with a thin
even coat of the Liquid White and it's already to go. So, let's go. Let's start out today with a little touch of the bright red, just a little. Don't need much. It's a very strong color. Just a little. Okay, let's go up here. And let's just go right in here, just using our little criss-cross strokes and we'll just lay in a happy little sky, just like so, a little more color. And I've started at the
horizon and working up today. I want to get lighter and
lighter toward the top. There, okay. But just use little Xs, little Xs like so. There we go. Now then, maybe a little more
over in this corner here. Don't want it left out. And that's about all we need right now. Let's have a little of
that pink right down here in what's going to end up being water. And for that, we'll just
use nice horizontal stokes. There we are. That little opening that you see, it only takes a few minutes
to paint the painting, but it takes a lot of fantastic people a very long time to put it together. And really proud of them. They've done a beautiful job. And we call that little
character the little painter man. Hm, the little painter man, I like that in his little painter suit. And if you like that, you ought to drop us a line and let us know. Maybe we can do some other things with that little character. There, all right. Now then, I'm going to
reach right up here, use the same old dirty brush, get a little touch of the Van Dyke brown and mix a little dark sienna with it. What the heck? Don't need a lot of color
though, just a little. Let's go right up here. Now up in here, we want the indication of just a happy little cloud that's floating around in the sky. And when you're doing this, I'm exaggerating, but
make strokes like that. It makes all those little
things happen in there. There. Just wherever you want it, wherever. Right there was a little
doer that hung down, something like that. Okay, a little more of the color and over in here, wherever, wherever. You can even tap in
some little stringy ones if you want them, there. Now, sometimes it's fun
to take a little white, just a little of the titanium
white, pure old white and go right up in here and put
in a nice light bright area. Ir really makes the
painting sparkle up here. There, puts one, just one nice spot. Makes you feel good when
you look up at that. All right. And that's about all we
had in that little sky. That simple. There. (brush strokes canvas) Okay, and just sort of blend this out while you have a nice clean brush and we're in business. Now then, let's build us
a little mountain in here. Tell you what, let's mix up, I'm going to use some alizarin crimson and sap green in about equal proportions, about equal. Now you can mix this to the green side or to the redish side, just depending on what kind of effect that you want. You can change the flavor either way. But mix it quite thoroughly. There, all right. Let me clean off the old knife here. Now, let's build us a little mountain. We'll take a little bit of that color and come right up in here. Decide where your big
mountain is going to live and using very firm pressure, very firm, just come right along here, right along, right a long. Decide where your mountain's going to live and begin dropping it in, just begin dropping it in. Over here we need a little bump. I think there would be one there, and we can do that that easy. And really really push that
paint right into the fabric. You can probably hear how hard I'm scraping and pushing, there. That makes the application
of the next layer much easier if there's not much
paint on the canvas here. Now then, we'll take a two-inch brush and we pull that because because there's Liquid White on there, you can literally move this paint all over the canvas if you want to. There we go. And by watching the brush strokes, it's nice way of laying out a lot of your highlights and shadows in mountains when you're doing them. It may not show too much here, but when you're painting, you'll understand exactly what I'm saying. You can see every little brush stroke. And we'll just blend that right
off to nothing, like that. Now then, let's take, let's take let's take a little bright
red, a little titanium white and we're going to mix it together and I want just a light
pinkish glow in my white. I don't want to set the
world on fire right here. Pull it out as flat as we can get it. Takes very little of that bright red. All right, and we go in and
cut off a little roll of paint. There it is. Now then, let's make a big decision today. Where does our highlights live? Maybe, maybe somewhere along in there. Now this will not be an exact duplicate of the painting that
you saw at the beginning because it's almost impossible to paint another painting that's identical, but it will give you a good idea of how this one was made. Yeah, here we are. I like that little painter guy though. It's really, really cute. It took nearly a full day to make that one little opening, but we had a lot of fun with it and did a lot of crazies and it's really, the outtakes would be even cuter sometimes than what you see here. There. Okay, tell you what, I'm
going to take a little white, put a little touch of
the phthalo blue into it, just a little, don't need much. And reach over here
and grab a little black and a little touch of crimson, just to dull it, just
want to dull it down. There, that's nice. Let me clean the knife off. i clean the knife only so it shows up a little better how we're loading it. When we come right in here and you can see that nice close up. See, that little ridge of
paint, little roll of paint right on the edge is so important. If you get in the habit of
loading the knife that way, it will save you a lot of agony, make things work much better for you. Now, we'll just come right along here, put in little shadows, very delicate, caressing the canvas, barely touching, barely barely touching, barely touching. Mm, this is such a gentle touch. Just gentle, gentle, gentle. There. Over here, we need some right there. Don't want that one left out. Okay, once again though, just barely barely touching the canvas. And you can come back and now we can begin adding all those little special things, little nooks and crannies. Little mountain goat's got to have a place to live too, you know. So, give him maybe a little place to have him a little house. He wants to live up here where he's safe and no body bothers him. Think that's what we all want. We want a place to live where we're safe and so does that little mountain goat. See, when you're making a
mountain, think about him. Shoot, might find out
you like the little guy. There we go. And we'll just sort of let those blend together right in there. Right in there. Okay. Okay, maybe right down in there. But just sort of look at your painting and each one's going to be different and you can bring all of
these little things together and make up little valleys and hills and bumps and crevasses
and all those things that you want in your painting. There. And each and every painting will be different and unique, one of a kind, and that's what makes it fun. It's really what makes
it fun is individuality. There. Okay, here and there. And take just the least little
touch of crimson and blue. It makes sort of a lavender color. Least little touch, mostly crimson though. And you put the indication here and there of some little dark areas. I'm using the small edge of the knife or you could just use a small knife. There. Straighten up your edges
the way you want them. Shoot, you're in business. Okay, take a clean very dry brush and just going to tap
this, being very sure to follow the angles and lift upward. Always follow those angles, most most important. Otherwise you'll destroy
everything that you've done. We don't want to destroy. We only want to diffuse. That's all we want to do is just diffuse. You can grab a little touch of that white sometime and pull it down and it looks like there's a little light that spilled over the edge. There, that's so pretty. Mountains, if you've ever seen my son, Steve paint them on one of the shows here, mountains are his specialty. He makes some of the
most beautiful mountains of anybody I've ever
known in this technique. That's his forte. There, and that's
probably one of the areas that he absolutely puts me to shame. He's a better mountain painter than I am. There. Okay, let's wash the old brush. (beats brush) We got to get that camera man over there just almost fell asleep. We'll get him. (chuckles) All right. Now then, let's take, we'll use some of that brownish color like so. What do we paint? Let's use fan brush. Take a fan brush. We'll go right in there and
load a little color on it. Maybe, maybe right there. There lives a happy little evergreen tree. There he is. There he is. See him? We'll give him a little friend, a little friend, there. Maybe, shoot you know what happens. If there's two trees,
pretty soon there's going to be three and then
there's going to be four. Then you're going to have a forest. Maybe back in here, we'll just take the brush
and just tap in some little indications of
some things in there. Not a great deal, just a little. There. Okay, maybe over here, have a few more of these
little indications. And this brown, once
again, that I'm using here was made from sap green
and alizarin crimson and this is a little
touch to the green side, a little bit to the green side, not a lot. Maybe right there, right there we've got a bigger chhp, there he is. See, you can just put as many or as few little trees in your world as you want. And everybody sees nature differently. So, you make it the way that you see it. Don't just try to copy. And down here, I'm going
to have some reflections. All we're looking for is just some dark areas underneath right now. We'll come back and work
on those in a minute. There. Let's take a one-inch brush,
same old color, same old color. Let's go right in here and just push in some little bushy areas, there. Once again, this is
still to the green side, little bit to the green side. There, right on out to nothing. Okay, take a two-inch brush, grab it and pull straight down. It's important that you
pull straight down though. Straight down. There. And very gently come across and we have instant reflections. Hm, I like that. That's sort of neat. Reflections are one of the neatest things that happen in this technique. Now then, let's begin
putting some color in there. We'll take a little liquid white, we'll go right in to some cad yellow and maybe I'll grab a little sap green. Oh yeah, that's nice, a little sap green. Load a lot of color into the brush. Let's go up in here, and right in here, yep, lives a happy little bush. There it is. There he is. Maybe he's got a little friend over here. There. Go into a little touch of the yellow ochre and we'll put another one there and just change these colors to any way that makes you feel good. A little red there. I like this red. In this particular painting, I'm going to put a few little red
things here and there. Just let them bounce in, there. Now, back to our two-inch brush, touch just the least little
amount of that color. I want a little bit of it
reflecting in the water. Phew, ooo, that's nice. There, that is so nice. (brush strokes canvas) Okay, now we can take a
little touch of our brown and we come back in here. just put a little land in. Just need a little bit of land. Don't want these little trees to fall off in the water and make a big splash. Scare the little beaver
that lives out here. There. A little white, a little dark sienna and we can come back, put the indication of a few highlights here
and there, not a lot. it's too far away to see a
lot of detail, just a little. And you can take a fan brush with some of those same colors on it, the Indian yellow, yellow ochre, red and pop in a few little things and it breaks up this line here, sort of brings everything together. Little touch of the Liquid White. And the Liquid White we'll use to cut in a little water line. Just act like you're trying to cut a hole right through the canvas, just saw back and forth and tilt the knife up and down, back and forth like that. And you'll be surprised at how well these little water lines just
slip right off there. A few little ripples here and there. All right, tell you what, we had some little trees on the side, so let's do them. I'll use that same old brown color that we have going here. We'll use a two-inch brush. You could use a one-inch
brush or anything. But we'll use this since it's handy. Take just the corner and begin tapping in a happy little tree, There, just like so. But just a basic shape. This is going to be
behind those other trees so we don't really, we don't really care. And you know, it's interesting, I have so many little creatures that I like to share with you. I thought today I'd show
you just a little bit while, 'cause I'm going to do another tree on the other side just like this one, and while I'm doing that, let me show you my little pal here. It's a little girl squirrel
that lives with me. She is the cutest little
devil that you've ever seen. She's my friend. And she is absolutely precious. There, in just a few more weeks, she's going to be ready
to go back to the wild and I'm going to turn her
loose right in my backyard and maybe she'll build a nest and have some little kids back there and maybe she'll bring them to see me. That little squirrel, boy
they're like little kids, they get into everything,
absolutely everything. Here she wanted to look at the headset and see what kind of music
we were listening to. Now this is true stereo. i mean this is getting into your music. I thought my son, Steve,
really got into his music, but compared to that squirrel, hm, no he just sits around and listens, she literally gets into it. She is very cute though. Now then, I'm just tapping
another tree over here. And maybe, I think there
was some land area here. We could just use the same
color and put in some, just some basic shapes. All we're doing here is
just covering up the ground. There. Okay, maybe something like so. And you can just push that right in with the whole big brush there. Now, before I clean that brush, I'm just going to go right in to a little bit of the redish color and just tap on a few
highlights on these trees, just a few. Go on the other side, and we'll tap in a couple over here. Don't want it left out. You won't see much of this, but if you look through the big evergreens that we're going to put on
there and you see some of this, people will think you really spent a great deal of time trying to make that. Just shhh, you don't
tell them any different. That's our secret. Let's mix up a little green and black, maybe even a little blue, crimson. Chhhp, there's the crimson. Let me wipe off the old knife. And I'll grab a fan brush here. There's one. There's one. Load a lot of color into the bristles. Let's go up here. We had a couple of evergreen trees and one of them we're
going to have right there. Now when you're doing
this, if you have trouble getting your paint to stick over the top of everything that you have behind, like all the mountains and everything, add the least, let me say that again, the least little amount of paint thinner. There's our little evergreen, see? But very little. Let's give him a friend. Very, very little of the paint thinner. A little goes a long way, long, long way. There we are. Let's go on the other side over here. We had one large evergreen here that went, oop, does now, right there, right there. Phew, boy that is a big old son of a gun. He lives up here and looks
out over the mountain and the lake and all the little creatures, probably saw the little
squirrels living here too. This is the kind of place I'd like for my little squirrels to live. There. Okay. And that quick we've got
some nice evergreens. We can take some of this
little brown and white color that we had left, put the indication here and there on both of them that maybe there's a
little trunk in there, just a little trunk, not much. Okay, back to my one-inch
brush that has the brown color. Let's just pop in some nice dark shapes here for our little bushes. There, reflect a little of
that down into the water. Okay, other side, we'll do the same thing, just a few little things here and there. Okay, wherever you want
a little bush to live. Now then, we can take our brush that we were using to put the highlight colors on, and we'll put a little color on it. And we go right up in
here and we can begin putting in all kinds of
little bushes and stuff that live right along here, wherever. Tell you what, tell you what let's do. Let's have some fun. Let me find a clean fan brush. Got too many of them going. Oh, there's one that's
got brown it it already. We'll use it. I'm lazy. We'll take some brown
and I'm going to reach over here and get a little
touch of the Liquid White. To that I'm going to mix dark sienna, a little dark sienna, maybe
even a little bright red. But this is Liquid White's very thin with a little color in it and we're going to load this
fan brush with the brown that we made from the
crimson and sap green. Both sides and I'm going
to take one side only, just one side, and go through this very thin light color and with this, Zooooooooo, we're going to make our
little evergreens back here. Big evergreens, I'm sorry. Those are big ones, giants. Shooooooo. But by double loading the brush like this, you can do, shooop. See there? You can do both sides
of the tree at one time. Maybe there's another one here. I don't know. You decide. On the other side over here, we have one, maybe it's going to live,
zoooooo, right there. Right there. And one, chooooo, there. If you don't make those little noises now, this won't work. Maybe a little one right there. Be careful that you
don't space all of them exactly the same distance apart 'cause if you do, they
look too symmetrical. Hm, whatever that means. There we go. Tap in a few bushes
down here at the bottom. There we are. Just a few little things. Now then, I'll find another fan brush. I've got fan brushes going everywhere. That same greenish color that we used to make the evergreen, take that and I'll push upward. Push upward with the
corner of the fan brush and just push in some nice little leaves and stuff and some little branches wherever you think they
should live, wherever. I like to leave a little of the trunk showing here a little. To me, that's quite interesting. This one goes right on
off the canvas there. There it goes. And it sort of gets lost. You can't tell which
one's which or whatever. There we go. We'll separate them
with a little highlight. There. Okay, over here, maybe this
one goes all the way off. As I mentioned earlier,
this is not going to be an exact duplicate of what
you saw in the opening, but it will show you the way it was made. There. All right, now we'll
take another fan brush. I say I have several going. Put a little green on it here. There. And we can come along
and put the indication of a few highlights on these trees. Don't want a lot. Just a few here and there. Just a few. Bloop, bloop. See, and this is where you pick out your individual limbs and separate them is with these highlights. A little on this one. Don't want him left out. All right, let's go over
here on the other side and put a few little limbs over here. There we go. See 'em? Some on this one. Okay, son of a gun,
that's pretty nice trees to be done that quick. We'll just take our two-inch brush, pull that straight down, create the illusion of a
nice reflection in there. Pull it gently across,
gently across, gently. Let me find that brush that we made the tree trunks out of, you can reflect those into the
water also, just like that. And then pull them, see? But they're there. They are there. Now, a little bit of that brown. Got to have a little soil down here. There it is. Little touch of brown and white, choooom. There we go. Little bit of Liquid White into there. (knife scrapes canvas) There, okay. Now, let's go back into our brush that has all the colors on it,
the highlight colors. Let's get a little touch of red. I want a little red. Ooo, ooo, ooo that's pretty. (chuckles) Sometimes these colors are so pretty they almost hurt, shooo, mmm. There's a nice little bush
that lives right there. And we'll give him a little
friend right down here and you decide how many you want and where you want them. Over on this side, maybe back in here, yep, you're right, there's one. There's one. Give him a little one there. Little bit of the nice red color. I like that red, whoo. There's another one. And there's one in here. There, do one bush at a time. Don't get in too big a hurry. There we are. Just use the side of the brush. We can put in all kind of little weeds and stuff in there, wherever, wherever. Let's see. Let me take my old fan brush
and you can bring this down, straighten this edge up. Make it look like there's
a little protrusion out into the water here, a little bit of soil. And that's basically how we did the little painting that's in the opening. So, I hope you try this. It will give you a little challenge, but it's a very very nice little painting that will make you happy. Scrape in a few sticks and twigs. Shoot, I think we have
a finished painting. So, from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God Bless, my friend. (upbeat music)
