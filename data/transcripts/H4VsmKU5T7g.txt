- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today we'd just
do a fun little painting. So let's start out and have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. And they'll come across,
right about there. Okay, I've got my standard old
pre-stretched canvas up here and I've covered the entire thing with a little bit of liquid white. It's all wet and slick
and it's ready to go so, shoot, let's just
have a good time today. Let's just get a little crazy,
let's have fun with color. Think I'll do a little winter-time scene. Maybe we'll use some alizarin crimson and there we are, go right down here and take a little bit of the yellow ochre, just alizarin crimson and yellow ochre and you can just mix 'em on the brush, just mix 'em on the brush. Let's go up in here and we'll just, let's just
dance in a little sky. So I say it's such a fantastic day here I thought we'd just do a, maybe
just a fun little painting and we'll use our artist's license today and that comes with
your first tube of paint and it says you can do
anything on this canvas that you want to do. And today, I just want to
make a happy little painting, maybe we'll make a little winter scene. We have some nice colors in winter. There, maybe something about like that. Don't want it to come down to far. There we go, isn't that a beautiful
little color though, sort of a peach color maybe, it's very, very pretty and very striking. It's a warm color that people will like and sometimes winter
scenes can get so cold that they're almost unpleasant. So this is a way of warming it up. I'm gonna take a little
more of that crimson, a little more of the yellow
ochre, little yellow ochre and I'm gonna be right back, get a little bit of the dark sienna, just mix them together, yellow ochre, dark
sienna, alizarin crimson. Let's go up here now maybe, let's really get crazy, let's just take the corner
of this big old brush and you could use a fan brush or the one-inch brush if you wanted to and I've got this one going and it's dirty so why not use it. There and we'll just put a
happy little cloud indication back here somewhere, just a little. More of the color and just sort of let this thing float around, have fun here. Shoot, maybe just some little
stringy ones, over here. Wherever you want 'em, just wherever, wherever. Okay, let me get another brush, I have several of each brush going here so I don't have to spend all
my time cleaning brushes, as much as we enjoy that or I enjoy it, the crew here may not
enjoy it as much as I do. If you could see the studio you would understand what I'm saying. I'm just blending the base of this out, just the base of it, leaving the top alone at this point on these little stringy clouds all you have to do is just take the brush and go right over but, now if you don't
have a thick, firm paint when you do that, you're in agony city, guarantee ya, instantly
you're in agony city. I'll take a little more of that and bring that cloud up a little so it's sorta blends together. Back to our clean brush and we'll just blend
the base of it out some, something like that, something like that. There and then we'll just
blend the entire canvas and you can make this
as smooth as you want it or you can leave it where
the clouds are more distinct, it's really up to you,
it's really up to you. You can make it very smooth or leave little edges on it or you can blend it till
it just all comes together. Painting is very, very individual, very individual, so you just do whatever makes you happy. As I say, you get that artist's license and it basically says you can do anything on this piece of canvas
that you want to do. And you can do it with
any color that you want, any design that you want, you can make any kind
of world that you want right here on this piece of canvas. (brush knocking can) Sometimes I hit the can, it's called "kickin' the bucket". There, just wash the ole brush, (brush knocking) and we shake em off and in business again. Let's build us a big mountain today. For that, I'll tell you what, let's really get crazy, I'm gonna take some black, black, we'll use alizarin crimson and maybe I think a
little of the dark sienna, what the heck, there that'll
make us a nice color. Least little touch of
blue in it, not much, very little blue, very little blue. Cut us off a little roll of paint, it's right out there on
the edge of the knife. Come right up in here, I want to do a huge mountain today. Let's begin pushing in
some nice shapes here, nice shapes, how ever you want. Now you have to be careful because when you start
making these mountains, these son-of-a- guns will grow on you and take over your whole world, it gets to be fun and you
don't know when to stop. You can just absolutely
eat up your whole canvas with a mountain. All right, maybe I don't know, maybe this just comes right over... well, I did say big mountain today so we really have a large one. We can spend the whole show just working on this one mountain. And at home when you have unlimited time do exactly that, spend a lot of time
working on one mountain or one area of your painting, especially when you're first learning because that's the way you learn and as I've mentioned before, if you make a mistake, don't get angry about it, look at your mistake. I believe sincerely that you can learn as much from mistakes, if not more, than you do from successes. And it's not a failure
if you learn from it, it's not a failure, it's only a failure if you
don't learn anything from it, then it's a failure. And it's the same, I think,
in your everyday life any thing that you try
and you don't succeed, if you learn from it, it's not a failure. Now if you make the same mistake again, different story. Okay, we're just blending it out and allowing it to blend
with the liquid white that's on the canvas. Just create that illusion
of mist down at the base that's all we're looking
for at this point. Whew, boy we really did come
out with a big mountain. It's a good place to just sorta
clean off the brush there, we'll just cover the
whole bottom down here. Maybe we'll have some snow down here and this will end up
being shadows in the snow, doesn't matter, whatever you want. Okay. Now it's time to have fun. Let's take, let's take titanium white and I'll put a little Indian yellow and a little bit of yellow ochre in there, mix 'em together with white, I don't want to over-mix them, I want to leave them sorta marbledy. Sure gonna get a letter
from an English teacher for that word, but see how marbledy it is, right in here, what I'm saying is,
don't over-mix the color and then when you pick up
that little roll of paint, right out here on the edge of your knife, all those various colors
are right here on the knife. Now then, see you can
come right along in here and touch, just let that
slide right off the knife. Put no pressure, absolutely no pressure, none whatsoever, none whatsoever and maybe just come right along here, touch, swoop, just let it go, just let it slide right along there. But if you start applying
a lot of pressure it's gonna look like
you're trying to ice a cake and it may look good to the taste but it's not gonna look like a mountain, probably that you wanted. Here, maybe right there, just pull it down a little, something like so. I'm gonna make a shadow color. We'll use white and black, least, least little touch of blue in it. Little dark, with a
little more white with it, oh, that's nice. It's sorta a blue-grey
we'll use for shadow color. Take the small edge of the knife and we'll come right here. Put a little shadow right up here on that little peak. That little peak needs a little shadow. Now we can bring this one, let's just bring it distinctly
right on through there. See that will push that
one way back some where, we don't even know where it's at, don't know that we even care. It's way back behind there. There, when you learn to
push mountains around, just push them around take the least little
touch of light color, don't want much, but a little lightening back in here. Just enough to make it interesting. Little touch of the shadow, we'll let that come right through and make like a little
recessed area in there, one them little hiding places
for the little creatures. There. Just sorta play these back-and-forth, let 'em go. There we are. It is unbelievable what kind
of mountains you can make just using a thing that looks
like a big ole putty knife. There. If that don't work, you can go out and work on your windows with the putty knife,
(laughing) whatever. There, let's take back to our little shadow color and we'll bring it right through here. I want a nice shadow
right through that area. But pay close attention to angles, angles are really what
makes mountains work. It's just those nice angles. Now then, this painting should just
about be a study in mountains. Look it there, now we bring that right on down, no pressure, I can't
say that enough times. Probably that's still the number
one thing I read in letters is I'm having trouble
making this high light, snow or whatever you want to call it, break on the mountains here. 99 times out of a 100,
it's one of two things, either the paint is too
thin and is turning to mud or you're applying to much pressure, one or the other though and 99 times out of a 100. There we go, now we can just bring this along and put all kind of little things. Back to our shadow color, you can grab that, begin putting in just some indication of some beautiful little
shadows back in here. There we are, just let it flow, right on down. Now something like so and maybe a little bit, back in here, just a little, see it? There we are, a little tiny shadow and that one comes distinctly through, see how it pushed that one back. Okay, maybe a little dark
color, here and there, just to brighten it. Believe it or not, that dark though will make it jump out at ya, but don't overdo, don't overkill, it's like so many other things, it get's feeling good and
you don't know when to stop. I have that trouble all the time. There, get carried away and it's easy to get carried away when it starts working well. All right now, let's play some games, let's have some fun. We'll take a little two-inch brush and create the illusion of a little mist, right here and at the base of this and blend upward, just tap, just tap and then blend it upward, upward, upward, upward. That removes the tap marks and blends it all together, makes it very soft and very nice. Okay, little bit right in here. Now let's take the same color, but because we've misted that then you can bring, maybe another projection right off this direction. There we go, just let that go, right on the rim, maybe this, look at that, there we go, that's what we need. And you just begin seeing
these things in your mountain, they're there, just start working on it. Let it go and see what happens, mix up a little more shadow color, here. Little touch of the blue in it, just ran out. There. Okay, wipe off the ole knife and we're back in business again. Let a little of it just
run right out this way. Now, back to my brush, clean, dry brush. I just wanna begin tapping this, I want to bring it all together, right down here at the base. There, it looks sorta like
it just spilled down there. When God was making this mountain, maybe there was a little left over and it just sorta, just
sorta dripped down here. There. But just by changing
the angle a little bit you can give that feeling of roundness to the base of this mountain and it makes another plane and pushes everything else back further into the painting. There. By working this a little, I want to dull it, it's a
little bit too bright, there. Just a little bit of
that will dull it down. All right, good, good. Now, little bit more of the mist, just by tapping, all in the angles, make the body move very soft and very, very quiet, very smooth. All right. Okay, and that gives us one heck
of a range of mountains. (brush swatting bin) Okay, now maybe back in here, tell you what, let's take... wipe off the knife. I wanna use, take a little bit of white, a little white, a little white and go right into, we'll take a little crimson, a little crimson, a little blue, white, we'll make a nice
lavender looking color here, to the blue side though. Okay, let me wipe the knife again. We just keep using the ole two-inch brush, it really didn't matter,
whatever brush works for ya. Maybe back in here, yup, right along in here, we'll just push in a little color, we'll come back and highlight
that a little later. There we go. Okay, like I say, that's just a good place
to clean your brush and the worst thing that could happen is it ends up being shadows in there and we're gonna be
looking for those anyway. So it doesn't matter. Take that same color and we pile it up in a pile and find a fan brush here. There's one. Just mix a little of
that on the fan brush, both sides are full though. And we'll go up in here and maybe in our world there lives a little tree. Let's do a little push up tree, where you just push the bristles upward, just push 'em upward. Look at there, look at there. Okay, maybe we'll give 'em a friend, maybe we'll put the friend on this side. Push upward, there they are. And you can make evergreen trees by pushing up, pushing down, maybe we'll do some
different ones in this, I don't know, see what happens here. I like to make 'em with that oval brush cause it makes such
interesting little shapes. Okay, we'll take another fan brush and we'll take a little white, a little white, get a little of the pthalo blue and a little black to dull it. Don't want it too bright, put a little black in it,
that'll dull it right down. There. Okay and with that we'll just tap the indication
of a few little highlights on these trees, don't want a lot. Just a little, little right here, wherever you think it should be. Shoot maybe there's even a little, here and there, in these bushes Just push upward, make the bristles bend upward. Sometimes you can just take the ole liner brush little paint thinner and maybe in our world, yup, maybe there's an ole dead
tree that lives right there. There he is and just very gently you can pull out a few little sticks and twigs that are still trying to hang on. There, poor ole things, they just had a hard life. But that easy we can put in
the indication of a little tree that has passed away. Okay, let's take a clean two-inch brush and let's begin deciding if
we're gonna have snow in here, where are snow's gonna live. Snow's gotta have a place to live too. So we'll come right in here and whew... if we pick up any of
that dark it's wonderful. We really don't care. Okay, we'll just lay a
little bit of that in, this is one of the easiest things to do in this method of painting, is putting snow in, but you need a little
darker color underneath so it shows. There, see there. Now I'll tell you what let's do, let's get crazy. Let's get crazy, let me clean this spot off to work here, clean off this spot to work. Let's take black, alizarin crimson and a little touch of phthalo blue, not much, very little blue, mostly black and alizarin crimson, very, very little of the phthalo. Don't want this to get to lavender on us. Now then, let's use a fan brush and with the fan brush I'm just gonna make a center for a tree, Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, get brave, this is your bravery test. Maybe, another one right there, smaller. Too slow, I wanna use this oval brush anyway. Let's try it and the oval brush is easy to identify cause
it has a black handle all the rest of our
brushes have white handles so it's easy to identify. All right, now watch right here we'll take that oval brush, maybe this tree goes way on up somewhere, we don't know where it goes. And we'll make one of those ole evergreens that's just hanging down. There. See there. That's all there is to it
with this brush though, makes all those beautiful little things. I gotta show you one of my babies. I like to show you creatures all the time and recently I went out to see the bird lady in Orlando who lives close to me, Ann Young who's a super, super lady and she let me play with Daniel here, Daniel's a little fish crow, a little Florida fish crow and he's one of the most
precious little things you have ever seen. Daniel and I spent, oh I don't know we probably
spent several hours together, cause he's hungry continually. Little rascal, he could eat you out of
house and home in a minute, look at the size of the
mouth on that character. But he is absolutely precious. There. Ann has all kinds of birds over there, she takes care of song birds that have been orphaned or injured. She releases a couple
of thousand birds a year if you can believe that. She raises these things
and releases that many. Oh, had a slip there. There. There, the only thing I was doing while you was watchin' Daniel there was just putting in a few little limbs on this ole tree here. That's all. There. Tell you what, just to balance this up a little, let's do one over here, too. You know me I like them ole big trees. Maybe this one goes, sorta just take a look back and see where it looks good. There he is, he just runs right off the top, hangs out right here. Literally hangs out right here. There he goes. All right and this will sorta bring
the painting all together. I like these hangy downs
that you see underneath, these limbs. And in this series I've used
this brush, quite a bit, cause I just like to make trees with it. And in some of the other series we've showed you how to
use the two-inch brush and the one-inch brush and all of those. There. Okay, maybe it'll come right on down, somewhere about in there. Wherever, doesn't matter, it's up to you, up to you. Now maybe, got another oval brush here, take a little bit of that blue and white, a little black in it to dull it and on this little tree back here, just want to put a few little indications of some cool highlights on that one. By cool I mean blue is a very cool color, where your oranges and reds and yellows are warm colors, hot colors. So I'm gonna put a little
cool color right there and just let it sorta disappear. And this one here, tell you what let me wash the ole brush, let me go wash the ole brush. Shake it off
(brush slapping) and just beat the ole devil out of it that's the fun part of all this. Now then let's come right in here, whoops, better mix up a little color. Take some white, little yellow ochre, put a little alizarin crimson in it, just to warm it up. Hm, that's nice, that is nice, it looks good enough to eat. Now, let's load this oval brush
with a little bit of this color and let's go right up in here and maybe this one is a little bit brighter. It's in the foreground, maybe it's a little brighter. There we are. And begin thinking about
shape and form of your tree. There we are, there we are, there's a little... Isn't that neat, the way that little
brush just drops 'em in. And the mountain tells us our
light's coming from the right so we'll just put a little a that on and then we'll drip the
brush into liquid clear. Liquid clear to really thin the paint down and also when it dries there'll be a little sheen to it. It'll shine and it looks like highlights. There, tap a little of that and let's go up in here and over here on the right there, we'll put some of
that nice, bright color. But don't overdo, you can very quickly
overdo, kill all your dark and this just, it just goes away and loses all of its effect. So be careful with this, be very careful, don't overkill. A little more of the liquid clear, I like this clear. That's another little
thing that I invented, quite awhile back, this really went over
well in the art world, quite a few artists who're using it now. Just like the black jet, so I just thought it was
a natural thing to have. You've got liquid white and liquid black, you need a little liquid clear. There. So that's my contribution
to the art world. There we are, a few little things here and there. See how that rascal's
just hanging out there. There we are, wherever. But it's one of the most fantastic ways of making evergreen trees and when you have unlimited time you can really set and play with this. Tell you what, I'm gonna take this and I'll grab it and
give it a little pull, like so. And we'll just take our little fan brush, the ole clock on the wall tells me it's about time to go today, so we'll just pop in a few little things like this and blend 'em back. And shoot, we're just about done, makes a very nice little winter scene. I hope you've enjoyed it, but you can put several of
these little layers in here and bring this all together and I think you'll love this one. Give it a try, drop me a line let me know how you like it, cause I think you'll
really enjoy this one. We're gonna call that one finished and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and God Bless, my friends. (instrumental music)
