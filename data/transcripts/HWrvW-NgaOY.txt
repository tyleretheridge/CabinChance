Hi, I'm certainly glad
you could join us today. I thought today we'd
paint the little painting that you see in the opening. So, I'l tell you what, let's start out and have 'em run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint the
little painting with me. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got up here. The way that little painting was made, we started with a plain, ordinary canvas. Just pre-stretched, double primed canvas. I took a little bit of white gesso and mixed yellow acrylic with it, Cadmium Yellow acrylic with it, and painted the entire canvas. Allowed that to dry completely. Then I took a sponge and some black gesso and just dobbed all this, just everywhere. Just use a sponge, I like a natural sponge because it has more shape to
it that a man-made sponge. After that was completely dry, then we've covered the entire canvas with just a very thin,
thin coat of Liquid Clear. And down here on the bottom,
I took a little Indian Yellow, which is a transparent
yellow, and put it down here. Because that particular
painting has some sort of a yellow cast throughout
the entire painting. So, I've put the Indian
Yellow down here at the base. Just so that yellow cast in that painting continues throughout. So, let's get started, let
me show you how we did that. I'm gonna start out with
the old two inch brush. And a very, very small
amount of the Phthalo Blue. Just a little bit of blue. When you're using clear with
nothing in the background, it takes very, very little color. Okay, let's go right
up here to the canvas. And we'll just take a little
bit of that blue color, and just begin dropping it right on here. Now, it'll sorta have a
little greenish tint to it because there's yellow underneath. But if you had wet yellow underneath, you would have brilliant, bright green. And we don't want that. Don't want that. We're gonna just let that
bounce around here and play. Like so. As I mentioned in one
of the earlier shows, we've had so many people write and say, "Show us some things that you can do with this Liquid Clear." We devoted a lot of the paintings
in this particular series to Liquid Clear. There we go, see, that easy. I don't wanna kill all
these nice areas in here. I'm gonna allow some of that yellow gesso to show through when the
painting is complete. I'm gonna go into a small, small amount of the Alizarin Crimson. And we'll just dance a
little of that in here. Just using little X's. Once again, there is very,
very little paint on the brush. About as close to no paint as you can be. Just enough to sorta stain the canvas. And the colors that we're using here are very, very transparent. So it allows that acrylic color
underneath to show through. And acrylic paint blends
very well with white gesso. You can make any color
background you want. It doesn't have to be yellow or red or, it can be any color your mind can imagine. So, practice a little bit,
and just experiment and play. And you'll find wonderful
things that happen doing this. Alright. Something about like that. Maybe a little touch more of that blue. I like that blue color in there. We'll just bring it right
on down in here somewhere. Okay. Now then. I'll just go right into
a very small amount of the Titanium White, don't need much. Now, the Titanium White, let's go right up here, is very opaque. In other words, you can't see through it. But if you put it on thin enough, you can still make out all
these little details through it. But this will be our light
area in this painting. This is where our light's
just zingin' from. There, and it'll give a nice soft, almost a misty appearance. Very, very pleasant. And this works so easy, even
if you've never painted before. This, again, is one of those effects that you can make very easy. And I'm just gonna put a
little bit here and there so it looks like little misty areas that are playin' in the
woods when we're all done. This is a soft painting, very soft. And maybe we'll go on the other side and put just a wee bit over here too. We don't want that left out. There we go. Somethin' about like that. And really and truly,
that's basically about all that we have in this background. That's really about all we have. It's that simple. But you can see there's areas
here, that's the pure acrylic, that are showing through. And there's areas that have
more opaque color on 'em, and they look very misty and very soft. Isn't that a fantastic way
of making a background that (makes excited vocalization) If you're out selling paintings, and of course none of us are
interested in that happy buck, but if you're out selling paintings, these son of a gun's here
will sell like hotcakes. Alright. Now then, let's have some
little sparkly bushes that live way back here in the distance. For that, I'll just keep usin'
the same old dirty brush. Take a little Cad Yellow, a
little bit of Yellow Ochre. A little Indian Yellow here and there. Just tappin' a little into the bristles. There, that's some gorgeous
close-ups we're getting there, isn't it? You can really see how
that brush is being loaded. Let's go back up here. Now then, we'll come right down here. And I just want some indications of some pretty little sparklers that live back here in the background. There, just some little sparklers. Maybe there's another one
that lives right about there. Not looking for a great deal of detail. Not looking for a lot of
detail, just a little. (vocalizes satisfaction) And when this is done, it'll look like the light's
just zingin' right through there and creating some gorgeous effects on some of these little bushes. There's a nice bright
one, it'll really show up. Of course, we get carried away sometimes and cover up a lot of 'em. So it may disappear or it
may not, we don't know. We don't care. Let me go onto the other side here. Maybe we'll put one or two over here. Somethin' about like that. Now, since in this particular instance, I have an idea of exactly
where this painting's going, I know most of that's gonna be covered up. So, I'm not gonna put a
lot of effort into it. Okay, now the fun part
of this whole technique. (chuckles) Let's wash the old brush. Shake it off. (laughs) And just beat
the devil out of it. That really is a fun part of this. Now then, let's start with
some nice background things. I'm gonna make a brown color
by using about equal amounts of Alizarin Crimson and Sap Green. These two colors mixed together make a gorgeous, gorgeous brown. And you can take it to the
red side or the green side. Just depending on your mood, or how you feel about the
painting, or whatever. Either way, you make the big decision. Let me clean the old knife off here. We just wipe the knife on
a paper towel, no big deal. Take a little bit of that color, and I'll load it the same way. Just tap right into it,
see there, just tap. Okay, let's go up here. Now then, we'll have a
few happy little bushes that live back in here. Isn't that a gorgeous brown color? But we're gonna play dark against
light, light against dark. Continually, continually
throughout this painting. That's really what makes it work. There's an area that has a
little more crimson than green. Isn't it gorgeous? Right in there. I hope that shows up on your set. There. Okay, see? But it's nice just to use
this old two inch brush. Sometimes we're afraid of this
brush because it's so big. But it'll do wonderful things for ya. Just allow it to do it. Allow it to work for ya. Okay, a little bit more of that color. And maybe we'll have one
that lives right there. See how you can create all
those little illusions? There, and these are far away. They're way in the background. So, we're not worried
about a lot of detail yet. As we get closer in the painting, then we'll be concerned about detail and being able to count
every leave on the tree. But back here, we just want indications. Now then, I wanna create the
illusion of another layer. Let me grab another brush. I have several of them goin' here. And we'll take a little white, with just the least little
touch of Yellow Ochre in it. And I'm just going to tap a little color. I wanna create a light
area at the base of this. Something like so. (rattling) Knock off the excess paint. And then we'll blend that right in. All I'm looking for is this misty area. The rest of it, we're not
concerned with at this point. That light area will be your separator when we put another layer in here. So take care of that little light area. It's your good friend. It'll do wonderful things
for ya in the painting. There we go. Okay. See, if you can tap a
brush, you can do this. That's all there is to it. Goin' back to my old dirty brush. We'll just use some Midnight Black. Load it the same way, just tap. Just tap it. Like so. You can see up close there. We get a lot of comments
about what the brush is. Why does it look like that? We tape the brush furrows to keep 'em from shining
when the studio lights, but other than that, they're the same identical
brushes that you're using. This is just black. It's just a little bit of
duct tape we put around there. Otherwise, they would shine
and cause big glares and... You know, it wouldn't
look good on your TV. That's the only reason we do that. Okay, see there, now
we have another layer. But you see how that little
light area is your separator? Without that it would have a tendency to blend together more. And we don't want that,
we want it to separate. So you can tell there's different
planes in your painting. There we go, maybe, shoot, why not? Just wherever. Maybe this one goes all the
way up here, I don't know. Just sort of let your imagination take you wherever you wanna be. 'Cause this piece of canvas, as you've heard me say a million times, truly is your world. I'm gonna grab a little liner brush. Let's take a little bit of
that nice brown color we made. We're gonna put a little
paint thinner in it. We're gonna thin that
paint down 'til it's, well, it's not quite ink
consistency, but it's very thin. Okay, let's go up here. With that, let's put in the
indication here and there and there and here of some
little sticks and twigs. And all the little things
that live in the woods. And they're all out in here. There, 'cause you always
have these out in the woods. Just gobs of 'em sometimes, lots of 'em. Lots and lots of 'em. There we go. And one of the questions I hear, is it better to pull down and
make little sticks and twigs, or go up? It really is up to you, try both ways. See which works the best for you. And that's the way that's exactly right. 'Cause painting is a
very individual pastime. Everybody does it different. And everybody enjoys it
for different reasons. There. I enjoy it, I think it's
my escape from reality. I can go in here and I
can really, literally, create any kind of world that I want. There's tranquility and peace in my world. There's never an imbalance. I have all my little animal friends. They live right here with me. Alright. Now then, that's comin' along pretty good. Let's just take a little white. A little bit of that brown that we made. (excited vocalization) That's pretty. There, maybe a little bit darker. Yeah, that's nice. Very nice. Cut off a little roll of paint. See there? Let's go up here. Now you have to start
makin' some decisions. Where does your land live? Maybe right along in here. So just take the knife, decide
where it lives, lay it in. Lay it in wherever you want it to be. There we go. As I say, I think these
kind of little paintings with the Liquid Clear are so much fun. And they're so, so effective. So effective. And they're easy to do. Now let's go take a clean knife. And just sort of fuzz up
the edges here a little bit. Just, I don't know exactly
what you would call it other than just fuzzin' it up. I just want a soft edge here,
I don't want that hard edge. And you can just take the
knife and just sort of rub it. And it'll create that illusion. Sometimes it comes out lookin'
like little bushes and stuff that are far away, and you
haven't hardly done a thing. There. (loud scraping) See there? And by not over mixing the
paint, you get these variations. Don't over mix your color. Most of the time we
leave it sort of marbled. Sort of marbled. And that way these happy
accidents happen continually. Continually. And then you learn to use these accidents to create beautiful, beautiful paintings. 'Cause as you know, we
don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents
every once in awhile. Maybe it comes on back up in here. Now, this will not be an exact duplicate of the little painting you see
at the beginning of the show. But it'll show you how it was made. I like that little opening
where you sneak behind the tree. Isn't that fantastic? That was created by a
very good friend of mine that works here at the station
by the name of Jerry Morton. Him and a lot of the other engineers put a lot of time into
making that little rascal. So, I hope you enjoy it. There. Okay. Well, you know me. I big trees, so I think it's
time to make our big tree. I think I'll use the filbert today, 'cause I want paint that's
very thick on the canvas. We'll go into the Van Dyke
Brown and Dark Sienna. I'm just sorta gonna gob a lot
of it right on the bristles. Let's go up in here. Major decision time. Where does your tree live? I think our tree does now, it lives right along here. And just, I'm putting
the paint on very thick. Very, very thick. Because I'm gonna put highlights on there. And I'm gonna depend on this thickness to catch the highlights. So, don't be afraid to use a lot of color. There, see there? That's a lot of paint there. So, we have areas in
this particular painting that are so thin there's
nothing there hardly, except Liquid Clear over acrylic color. We'll have a limb right here
that (imitates shooting). And then we have other areas that could be up to like
1/8 of an inch thick. And I like that in a painting. Very much, very much. Let's give him another
big old arm over here. And you can make him crookedy and have all kinds of character. Don't just make a old
straight tree, shoot. If you do that, the
lumberjacks will come along and whack him down and make
a telephone pole out of him. We want a tree here that has character. Gnarly old tree, he's had a hard life. Things weren't always good
out here in the woods. There were some years that
it didn't get much water, and maybe when he was little,
a big old creature came along and gnawed on him a little bit. Just make up little stories, so it makes sense why you
tree looks the way it does. There. See, we'll put a big old foot
out here for him to stand on. There we go. And we'll give him another arm or two. Maybe he's got another arm out here. I'm just gonna put a few on here. When you're doing this at home, you can put as many arms
on your tree as you want. I just wanna show you how they're made. This little filbert brush
still works very good for doing things like this. There we go. See there? Now... But that paint is so thick on there. As I say, in some areas, it's probably a good 1/8 of an inch thick. It has bumps and ridges on it, and when it dries you can
actually feel the bark. Alright. Now, I'm gonna take, I'm
gonna take, I'm gonna take... The little script liner brush. Put a little more brown color
over there. (excited whoop) I want some variation. Script liner brush, and a paint thinner. Gonna get quite a bit of
thinner, 'cause I know I'm gonna use several
different strokes here. But we wanna fill the
bristles full of color. Fill 'em full of color, and
that paint is very thin. But see, there's a lot of
color in those bristles. And this is a, a liner brush has very little
bristles, so it holds a lot. Let's go up here. Now then, delicate touch. All we're gonna do is just
barely touch the edge of this. And allow the paint to be picked up on those areas that are very thick. That's why we used the filbert brush rather than a fan brush
or somethin' to do this. I want it to be very thick. So that just those ridges
of paint pick it up. You can make some of the
most gorgeous looking bark like this on trees. See there? See how these little areas, now, we'll push that limb into the back by just coming distinctly
through with that one. Now see, he's behind. Didn't know you had that
kind of power, did ya? Alright. It's just barely touchin',
just let the bristles graze it. Graze it. I really do think this is
one of the neatest ways I've ever seen of putting all kinds of gorgeous
little things in there. Like that. Okay, and over here on this side, we'll just put a few little things. A little more paint thinner,
a little more color. If you have trouble making
it come off your brush, just add a little more
paint thinner, that's all. If you don't get all
these ridges and bumps, it means that your under-color
was not thick enough and you don't have all those
variations under there. Now, you can sit and try to draw these. It'll take you forever. Or you can just do it this
way, and it just works. (imitates shooting) Like that. Isn't that neat? And as I say, when this thing is dry you can feel this, and
it'll feel like real bark on a real tree. Maybe an old tree that you used to know. Might have lived in your yard one time. It might have been your good friend. There's nothin' wrong with
havin' a tree for a friend. There we go. Comin' right on out of
wherever you want to. Somethin' like so. Maybe a little bit right in here. Okay. And if you really wanna
sparkle it on the edges, just here and there, don't over do, you could just take a
little bit of light color. See there? Look at that, look at that. I'm sorry, I get excited sometimes. I've painted thousands and
thousands of paintings, and I still get excited when this works. It's so fantastic. Alright. That'll show you how it's done. Okay. Now then, while I've got
the old paint thinner goin', we'll go right into a little
bit of this nice brown color we made from crimson and Sap Green. And let's just put some little
arms here and there on this. See, just let it flow. There. As I say, I like these woodsy scenes, 'cause this is a fantastic place for all of my little creatures to live. I gotta show you one
of my little creatures. Very recently I had the
privilege of goin' out and seein' a fantastic
lady named Carmen Shaw. And she had a little baby fox. And she told me if you look
in the dictionary under cute, it would say baby fox. Isn't this the most precious
thing you've ever seen? I'm just puttin' limbs on
while you're watchin' that. Not doing anything that you won't see. But I love these little animals, and Carmen, there she is, she brought a little raccoon
over to visit the little fox. This is just a baby raccoon. Of course, he's a little
older than the fox. Whoops, hey. (laughs) I think maybe there's a little
personality conflict there. But aren't those precious little things? I have to agree with Carmen. When they made the word cute, they had that little fox in mind. There is no doubt, 'cause
they are absolutely precious. I think that one's six or eight weeks old. Carmen's a super lady. She lives right outside
of Orlando, Florida. And she's a rehab specialist. She takes care of all these little animals that are injured and orphaned, and she nurses 'em back to
health or raises them up. Whatever they need. And then she turns 'em loose. Let's 'em go back to nature. Okay. Now then, let's take, I want a little tree in the background, we'll take the old two inch brush. A little bit of brown. A little bit of Bright Red. A little more Bright Red,
a little Yellow Ochre. Mix 'em together. A little more Bright Red, I like that. Let's go right up here. Now, over this dark area, in our world, we're gonna put us a nice tree. But we're gonna let some
of that show through. There. Just a big tree that lives
up here and has a good time. There we go. We'll take the little liner brush. Some of that brown color. Let's put the indication of a trunk and a stick and twig that live in there. There, just however many, doesn't matter. Now then, use that same old dirty brush. It's workin' pretty good. We'll go back in with some light color. This is Cad Yellow. Just to give it a little highlight. Maybe I'll get a little white,
put that in there with it. There, okay. Now then, let's go right up in here. And let's drop a few
little highlights on there. There we go. That easy. We got us a pretty nice little
tree that lives back here. There, he watches my little fox back here. Let's take some white, a little
bit of that brown we made. And just come right along in here. Maybe we'll put in some
more little land area. Notice I'm not covering all of this up. I want some of that dark to show through. I'll tell you what, let's
take a little bit of our brown we made from the crimson and the green. Let's put some more little
bushes that live right here. Just a few little happy bushes
that live right in there. There. Aright. Big old bush lives right there. Go right into the black, so we have a little separator in there. See there? That's all there is to it. Now then, while I have it goin' I'm gonna touch just a
little bit of the color. A little bit, just to
put some indications. Don't want much. A few indications of a
highlight here and there. Gonna take my old filbert,
put a little brown on it. Light brown on one
side, dark on the other. Maybe there's an old fence,
lives, yep, right there. Yep. Now, this guy, he took care
of his fence about like I do. He didn't do too good. It's fallin' down on him. And it just comes right on down. Maybe like that, maybe like that. Maybe just one old rail that's still tryin' to hang on there. Like so. Put a little bit more
the color right in here to indicate some of soil, dirt. Land, whatever you wanna call it. There. Oh, I know, I know
where we got that goin'. Shoot. Let's put a little more right in there. Just helps give it a little more depth. Back into our black. That was just the brown we
made from crimson and green. There we go. There. Take a little more of that, and we can sort of bring that together. It looks sort of like a little road now. It goes back in there. We don't know where it goes. I don't know that we even care. It's just a nice little
place back in there. Take our liner brush, a
little bit of light brown. We can flip up a few
little weeds and sticks and things that live all in there. Somethin' about like that. Wherever you want 'em. This is one painting that I really hope you'll give it a try. Because I think you'll find it to be one of the most enjoyable little things using this Liquid Clear
that you've ever done. And it works, and maybe, that may be one of the
greatest parts of it. A little highlight right here. It works so easy, the
clear and the black gesso. It will just make your
painting world so much easier. Well, I think we about
have a finished painting. I wanna take a little
bit of the Bright Red. A little paint thinner. And I'm gonna sign this one. I have a short name, so
it's very easy to sign it. As I say, I hope try this one. If you have time, send me a
photograph of your attempt. I'd love to see it. And from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (bright laid back music)
