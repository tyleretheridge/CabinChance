- All right, here we
are ready to go again. You know just recently I was doing a demonstration in a mall. And I had a man come to me and he said, Bob, I can never paint
because I'm color blind. All I can see is gray tones. So I thought today, we'd
do a picture in gray just to show you that anyone can paint. So what I've done here, I've mixed up a great big bunch of blue and brown, probably about one third
blue to two thirds brown to give you a rough idea of
what the mixture is here. And all I'll use is this
gray color and white. I have the colors on
my palette only because I was too lazy to clean my
palette before we started this. So I've already applied some
magic white to the canvas to help speed things up a little bit. So let's take the old mighty brush here and we'll take a little
bit of this gray color out. (thudding) Beat it into the bristles, really work it into the bristles. And let's start with
the old mighty sky here. Just let it work around and play. (screeching) Great big things happening here. Just let 'em fall out of your brush. Keep that brush moving. Circular patterns. Just let it play. (thudding) And we'll put a little bit more paint. Maybe we'll come right over in here. (screeching) Here we go. Just let that work. (thudding) We're gonna have a light source, (screeching) right in here. I'm gonna have some light
coming through there. Maybe we'll do some all
mighty mountains today. We haven't done mountains
in a past couple of weeks, so, I think it's time. Now we're cleaning the brush. (water splashing) Here we are. Shake off the excess paint thinner. (metal clanking) (thudding) Okay, now, gentle squirling motions here. We're gonna begin
blending the sky together. Very gentle. (screeching) Just let it work. Let it play. Let these little things just all around, fly around, have fun. Here. Let's begin pulling 'em like this, just to give an indication that
light seeping through there. Here we go. Now, we'll work on this one a little. Just make that brush
continually go in circles. That's probably the biggest
suggestion I can give you that will help you, let it
continually go into circles. Otherwise, it'll look
like it's raining up. We don't want that to happen. Okay, now, we're just gently
blending it together a little. Okay, now, take the fan brush. And we'll take a little
bit of this gray color on the fan brush, very very little color, very little color. And let's put a few little
happy clouds in here, a little bit more distinct. And it will push everything else back. Once again, circular pattern. Always try to do this little circles. There we go. Just let these little
clouds float around the sky. Okay, now, we'll take the big brush, and very gently, blend out the back of it. (screeching) Here we go. We'll fluff it out a little bit. And then blend it together. Maybe a little more gray and we'll put in a little more cloud. Just right in here. Here we are. Just let him float around. (screeching) Fluff 'em up. Blend them in. (screeching) Okay, then that gives up
a pretty nice little sky. (water splashing) (metal clanking) (thudding) And I thought today, we'd
do some fantastic mountains. Everybody enjoys mountains. (screeching) So let's start here and we'll just use the same gray mixture, this blue and brown. (screeching) And let's go right over here and drop in a fantastic big old mountain. (screeching) Oh, there we go. Just let him wander. Very little paint. We take off all the excess paint. Scrape that canvas hard. All you want to remain under is the value, what's been pushed into the canvas. Now, with the large brush,
we'll pull that down. (screeching) There we go. Already we begin to have
a basic mountain shape. Okay. All ready. Now, we'll highlight that mountain here. I'll take some white. (screeching) Just titanium point. Let's have our light
coming from the right. So, we'll put a little highlight, oh, maybe right there. There we go. (screeching) Maybe a little touch right
up in here somewhere. And then light's gonna
strike along this edge. (screeching) There, now for the shadow colors since we have nothing else. We'll just take a little gray and white to make it a little bit darker than what we have up
there for the highlight. A little lighter than the
darkest color in there. So, somewhere in between. Now, very gently, we'll begin
pulling shadows in here, on the contour of the mountain. There you go. (screeching) There it comes, just
let that old paint break as it pulls down there. (screeching) Okay, a little bit over here. I think we've mentioned this before but you need to have a very
very firm paint to do this. (screeching) If you have a thin oily paint, you're gonna get into some problem areas because you'll become mud mixer. You need a paint that's strong, firm, dry. (screeching) Okay, we'll give this one a
little shadow right there. So he stands out as an individual. (screeching) Just bring this some down. Let your imagination just wander around when you're doing these things. Now, with a clean dry brush, (thudding) we'll just lay some mist
down here just by tapping. Just tap the bottom of it. Over here, follow these angles and tap then lift upward. Always following the angles that you built into your mountains. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. (screeching) Okay, that's give us a
nice quick basic mountain. Let's put one on the other side. (screeching) Might as well have some
good practice here. Let's come right up here. Oh yeah, all mighty mountain. Here it comes. Just let him wander right
on here down in front. (screeching) This one, I wanted to be
a little darker in value than I have behind so it looks closer. So I'm applying a little more color than I did on the first one. (screeching) Okay, we'll blend this one down but I'm not blending
it as much, once again. (screeching) There we go. All right, clean the
paint off the brush here. (water splashing) (thudding) I probably just bought a studio. (screeching) Okay, now we'll put some
snow on this mountain. Touch, follow the contour of the mountain. (screeching) There we go. (screeching) Now, it just really give me a feat when I was a traditional painter. Oh, it's been weeks sometime
working with a little brush trying to make all these things happen. (screeching) There. (screeching) Ain't that fantastic? That you can make all
mountains in minutes. And you can do it. There's no big secret to it. All you need is a dream in your heart. (screeching) And an all mighty knife. Okay, now make a little
more of the shadow color. (screeching) And we'll throw some shadows in here and move right along. (screeching) And it'll be a touch darker. There we go, that's
what we're looking for. We'll put a little shadow right in there. A little shadow here. Ah, there's one. There he is. There. There we go. So how easy just to give
dimensions to these mountains. It's all a game of angles. Just a game of angles. Mountains are geometric shape. Play with angles. (screeching) Okay, maybe we'll bring this down just a touch farther here. (screeching) Okay, and now we'll gently
tap on this a little just to diffuse them, don't
wanna destroy, just diffuse. Here we go. And I guess this brush is dirty, I think we'll put some water in here. I think we'll have water on this one. (screeching) There we go. Just pull up from outside the image, try to keep this lines level so that your water didn't look like it's running off the canvas. You have to tie a book in if
you don't want it to catch it. There we are. (screeching) (water splashing) Okay. (metal clanking) (thudding) Since, I owned the
studio, I can do that now. I'm gonna use the one inch brush and I'm just gonna gently lift up. It's just a clean brush. Just lift up, make it look little things way back in the distance back here, far far away. There we go. Just lifting up with little short strokes. Don't let the strokes get too large. All right. Just here and there. And maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe there's some little
evergreens back here. I'm gonna make some with a fan brush and maybe we'll make some
of the palette after this. A little bit different. All right, let's just drop a
little evergreen right here. And I'm using the color
that's very very close to the background mountains. So that looks far far away. Give him a friend. We forget the trees get lonely too. Then as you make trees, that in your mind, they're
a little bit closer to you. Allow 'em to be a little dark. A little bit darker and
maybe there's one areas. Right there. Now he's closer so we want him darker. There we go. And we'll lay some color right there. And we just gently lift up, just to make all kind
of little things happen. Since, this is a wet on wet technique, you can smooth the paint, it'll slide. The magic white underneath
makes it wet and slick. And it'll just slide and move all you have to do is learn
to control it a little. Okay. (water splashing) (metal clanking) tick-tick. Now, let's take, put a little bit of reflection into the water. I've taken a little bit of the tree color and I'm just gonna gently pull down. Straight down. (screeching) Most importantly, it comes straight down. And maybe we'll make an uneven one here. So, all kind of little things can happen. Now if you follow it down, very gently, go across, just enough to give it a watery feel. It's easy to destroy. And look at that already. (screeching) Let's take a little bit of the magic white mixed with a little bit of firm white. I wanna paint this a little bit thinner. There we go, now cut through it. And let's put some happy
little water lands back here. (screeching) Now, watch right in here. We'll create a little cove. (screeching) Just that easy. But all these lines need
to be basically straighter, once again, your water will
run out of the painting. (screeching) Okay, we'll just let one
run in the corner here. (thudding and screeching) Just like so. Okay, let's make some happy
little area green trees and I promise today, we'll make
them a little bit different than we have from the past. Oh, we'll make them with the
old mighty palette out here. (thudding) Okay, decide basically what
you wanna tree, right there. Now, we're gonna take blue,
just a tiny bit of paint, right at the point of the knife and touch, and we just begin touching. We're not trying to draw with this knife, all we're doing is laying
paint on the canvas. We touch the canvas, the
canvas takes what it wants, gives you back what's left. (screeching) Okay, just let this tree
work out of your knife here. And we're still using nothing but the blue and the man-dite brown. Blushing blue and man-dite brown. And there's our little tree. Maybe right there is another one. (screeching) I just wanna do enough of these
to show you how to do 'em. When you do your painting at home, you determine how many
trees live in your forest. (screeching) There we go. See there, lot of paint zone. and what's really nice, when these painting dries these trees are very thick,
you can feel the texture. All right. (screeching) Maybe over here, maybe a great big tree, maybe one, maybe he's tired, (screeching) like that. But once you do that, you're committed to, you got to put a tree there now. Okay, so there we go. A lot of paint. (screeching) Okay and hum along as you paint. Just let it flow of your knife. (humming) And all that kind of good stuff. Okay, lot of paint. Lot of paint. Big trees, strong all mighty trees. Here we give 'em a little trunk indication just by cutting through. (screeching) Right over here. Up here, just a little indication. (screeching) Maybe some little stems here and there. (screeching) Okay, now if we wanna
highlight these trees, maybe lay a little bit of snow on 'em. (screeching) We need a shadow side
and a highlight side, so I'll just use the
same basic shadow colors I used on the mountain,
maybe a little touch darker, there we go. All right now, very gently, very gently. Just touch so the paint
grabs on those high points, just barely touch like so. Put the shadowing first,
just go over here, here it comes, barely touch. (screeching) There it is. Okay now for the other side, maybe there's some snow
laying on these trees. We take a little bit of
white, titanium white and very gently once again, just a little, barely touch, catch the high points. Don't wanna kill all that
beautiful dark color. (screeching) Okay, just do it over here. Little tiny bit, (screeching) okay, there we go, like so. Now when we get to start paint going here. Let's just lay a little
bit right under here. (screeching) Okay, there, now we'll
take a one inch brush and back to one of our golden rules, it takes dark in order to show light. So, we'll take a dark color
on the one inch brush here, I'm gonna throw in some little bushes. These are just the shadows for the bushes. (screeching) Something like so. And over here, maybe some bigger trees. (screeching) Always try to remember to the
things farthest away first, like in my mind, these
trees behind these bushes, so you need to do him first and then come forward. (screeching) Okay, now that we have dark, we can begin worrying about the light. Let's pull this down one right here and turn into a happy little reflection. (screeching) Zip, that easy. Okay, now we use a one inch brush with a little magic white
and a little firm white mix together, we're
looking for a paint this, slightly thinner than what's
on the canvas already, so it'll stick. Maybe attach more magic, and here we are. Okay now, now, push off all
these beautiful little leaves, just let them hit, sparkle in the sun, and at the same time you can reflect them right into the water. That easy. Here comes the one right here, there. (screeching) There they are, look
at the little rascals. Ain't that unreal that you can do that in such a quick, quick stroke. Now very gently, whisper light. (hushing) Don't wanna destroy, just
wanna diffuse a little and that's how we make mirror reflections. Okay, now let's take a
little bit of the white and put some snow down here on the ground. Oh, there we are. Okay a little bit of the thin white, it'll make a little
water land underneath it. (screeching and thudding) Okay, there we go, all right. Okay now we can take in, just cut a little sticks here and there. Just like so, there we are. Okay now, we get to worry
about the other side. And that one is, that one is looking good. A little more of the thin white
mixed with the thicker white so it'll stick. (screeching) We'll put some happy little
bushes right along here. Look at them little
rascals sparkle in the sun. This is a cold painting, blue and it makes it so cold. (screeching) Okay, we'll put a little
few stems in this. (screeching) You know this reminds
me of a home in Alaska. We see a lot of scenes like this, and I've always want to live in a, in a beautiful
mountain range like this. So let's build a house. (screeching) We gotta have a house. We'll make the back
key to the house first, just like so, and we'll make
the other side of the house with just white, let it
run right down the canvas. There he is, just like so. (screeching) And a little more of the dark
color fill them in the front. (screeching) A little bit of that
white get on your knife, just to give it a little tone
of values here and there. (screeching) At such, it'll be good in dark. Just give him a door, he
needs a door. (whistles) Here we go. (thudding) A little touch of the
magic white to outline it. Maybe this is an old slab cabin, so we need to put some boards in here. (squishing) And we need some snow on
the other side of the roof. Can't have just one side with snow on it, we need snow on both sides, there. Okay, now we need some snow on the ground. So we just touch and snow is a game of
angles like mountains are. So most important that you
follow the lay of the land when you're laying a snow in. Just let it go in the
direction the land flows. (screeching) Here we are. Now let's push little house back up into the bushes a little more. I'll take a little bit of the dark color and put a happy little bush right here and then some of the light color and just throw some highlights
on that bush like so. Maybe a little bush lives right there. Ah, there we go, super. All right. (screeching) Maybe just to play a little here, just throw a little tree
right up through here. There. (screeching) Okay, we'll put a little highlight on him. And I'm gonna use the liner brush and some thin oil and I'll thin
some of this down a little. Throw in some happy little
leaves outside here on this tree. Just let 'em right along. Wherever you think they ought to be. And you can use paint thinner
to thin this paint down. I prefer oil that causes slicker, okay, it moves easier. There we go, maybe one more right there. And we just let him go. Few little sticks down here at the bottom. (water splashing) I think we're just about
to have a finished picture. (metal clanking) A little bit of oil here and we're gonna sign him in red, we're gonna treat and we'll in
a little signature on there. This is a fantastic painting because it uses only gray and white. I'd like to show you a variation of this and it uses only burnt amber and white. So maybe we can get the
camera to swing over to that and we'll take a look at it and show you what you
can do with other colors. And there's really no limit to what color, any color will work as long
as you use the basic method. So, on behalf of all of us here, you have a super day. (soothing music)
