hi I'm glad you could join me today and welcome to the joy of painting tell you what let's start out today and first thing hammer on all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that what's going up here I have my standard old canvas up here it's all covered with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white it's wet and slick and it's ready to go so let's go thought today we just do a fantastic little scene maybe maybe we'll start with a little bit of yellow ochre maybe do a building today the smallest little amount of yellow ochre tiny tiny tiny little bit all I want to do it just tempt the sky I want to put just the tiniest tiniest little bit of color into the sky let's do something today has a lot of greens in it that's a lot of fun now this color will not show up much until we begin putting other colors around it and then the son-of-a-gun ocean boy it'll shine it okay there and then I just use the same old dirty brush I'm gonna go into a small amount of top alizarin crimson alizarin crimson and I'll reach right over and I'm gonna get the least little touch of Prussian blue so I have a little crimson little blue but very little paint overall very very little paint I don't want don't want much paint today now made this lavender color because yet you can mix on top of the yellow and it remains pretty pure and it doesn't turn a bright green on you you must use a bright blue sky with that little bit of yellow oh you'd have a happy green sky and that's not what we're looking for today we're just gonna through something some little shapes right in here wherever wherever that bit more color on the brush but very subdued there we go I think I'm gonna cover most of this up with some big old trees and stuff but a little of it will show through so that's the reason we're putting this here but we don't have to spend a great deal of time working on it and worrying about it because we're gonna cover as I say most of it up there we are something like so okay that gives us enough sky for what we're looking for today let's have some more fun we're going to some black a little bit of black be right back get a little bit of a yellow cooker black and little yellow ocher retread it down here be right back with some white there we go so we have black lil yellow ochre and some white gives us sort of a greenish color now if he comes out to green add a little crimson to it and that will dull it there I don't want it too bright yet okay man we have to start making some big decisions in our world let's just start putting in some background color for some happy little bushes and shrubs and there I'm just using the corner brush and tapping downward just sort of let these things just happen maybe yep there's one right there but you can make these little trees is full or as thin as you want them as tall or a short dark or as light just using the corner of a two inch brush that's all you need and our world maybe right here there's another tree see that's all there is to it this is sort of a greenish color but it's not a bright green it's very dull very subdued there can't even warrant a little more color and let's go right here ATAG uses just several layers of trees here this is a fantastic way if you want to make a scene that looks like it's deep deep in the woods because you can put a layer after layer of trees just by doing that and you really have done very little work and as I've mentioned before where this is this is a lazy man's way to paint I look for easy ways to make painting work and we try to pass those on to you there I say I thought today we'd do a nice building I get a lot of a lot of requests people want to know how to paint certain types of buildings in fact in our newsletter I just I just did a whole article devoted to nothing but buildings to try to help people out there I can go into too much more detail than I can here but if you learn how to do one basic building then from that you want to be able to do about any kind of old building okay that gives us some background material I'm gonna go right into that same color with the liner brush filled with paint thinner and I want to thin this down I'm gonna put a little Van Dyke Brown there too what the heck so I get brown and the same color ways using to make the trees but very thin should be like ink let's go up here now you have to make some big decisions where your little tree trunks live in here I just put in the indication here and there there's all kinds of things happening some of them would be so quiet and so subdued you just barely can see them there and these are just like people some of them are tall some short some heavy some very thin so tree trunks girl have or makes them happy so don't be afraid to experiment but in all kinds of weird ones I think probably nothing would teach you more than just experimenting do as many different things as you have the nerve to do you just go for it there sometimes you learn more from mistakes than you do from trying so hard so anytime you anytime you make a mistake before you get upset with it look at it sometimes those mistakes turn into be the best learning devices we have there we are and I meant you know one of the other shows maybe even a different series I don't remember I get letters from people who say they're just not satisfied with what they're doing that their paintings just they're just not coming out the way they wanted I think if there's a secret to human nature it's the fact that we aren't satisfied we're never satisfied I hope you I hope you're absolutely plagued with dissatisfaction through your whole life because if you are you'll always strive to do better and over and over I tell my students if you ever do a painting you're completely satisfied with you might as well quit cuz you have nowhere else to go there and the next one that I do is gonna be my masterpiece I probably won't be this one with the next one and I'm just jumping all around here but in all kinds of just little things there yeah I'm just gonna grab that same old brush what the heck go right back in black grab some of that yellow ocher but this time I'm going to have a little more of the ochre the more crimson so I get black yellow ochre crimson but a little a little bit more of the yellow ochre so it's a little more greenish and then we can with that we can just put the indication here and there of some highlights still using the same old brush doesn't matter one inch brush would work find or the round brush there whichever one you like there we go I like your so big brush because it's faster it's all here and there and there and here to think about shape and form trough them Rascals in there there a few little bushes it live back in there there's another one do you right there see it pushes all those sticks and twigs back and gives dimension to your woods and that's what you're looking for all those fantastic little effects it just they happen I paid thousands and thousands and thousands of paintings and I still get excited about this when I watch it happen there we are okay man maybe there's one strong tree that lives right in this area here he's a little closer so I'll take black black black back to my yellow ocher little lizard crimson but I want this color to be a little darker little bit darker and we basically just use the same color so far in all these trees and bushes here but just by varying the cover it gives us the impression that there's a lot of different depths here all you have to do is just vary the color the intensity or the brightness of the color now I have a bush right down here that's a little closer man back to my liner brush paint thinner and Van Dyck Brown want this to be thin like ink okay and maybe I've been here their lives mmm big ol tree see there there big strong tree maybe he's got an arm right there wherever you want him wherever you wanna just sort of look around it and see what trees look like make friends with a tree you know if you're if you're a painter we're allowed to we're allowed to talk to trees and little furry animals and things like yet painters are special here we're a little different we're a little weird and we can get away with stuff like that there we go people look at me when I'm like I'm a little strange hugger I'm talking to squirrels and rabbits and stuff that's okay that's okay I'm gonna take a little bright red right on the liner brush just mix it up the same way and let's just go right up here and just put the indication of a little highlight right out of the edge of this tree just make out a little Sun again stand out here and shine okay just a touch of the bright red and I'm going right back into the same old dirty brush take some yellow ochre back in the same color I want this dirty looking green color tap some into the bristles now then let's put some nice highlights out here on this tree make about shape and form again don't just throw a minute random there look at all the things happening in that tree everything you could paint a tree that looks that delicate a two-inch brush it really can there okay maybe down here a little highlight on this rascal but what him left out and then let's get crazy I'm gonna fill this whole area up with color so maybe the quickest way to do it I just take some Van Dyck Brown little black just mix them just mix them on that I'm a 2 inch brush here let's just paint this in shoot you could do this with a paint roller just idea I'm really pushing it right into the fabric though a lot of pressure on the brush it's not there's not a great deal of paint here I'm just really pushing the color right into the fabric they're just fan dyed brown and midnight black really black see if it that quickly you have this whole bottom area filled in okay same old brush I'm just going to go into little touch of the yellows I'm looking for a dark dirty green color tap a little bit of it into the bristles and we come back here decide where our land lives and we can begin tapping in a little bit of highlight a little bit of grassy areas here there and all I'm doing is just tapping straight down I want this to stay quite subdued quite dark soft there and maybe you do your painting like this you want it to be brighter and shinier and that's fine painting is it's a very individual anything that you want in your painting then that's right that's just the way it should be because we each see nature through different eyes and your painting should reflect what you see not what somebody else tells you is right to put what you feel is right what you see with your own eyes what you feel with your own heart because painting painting to me reflects love there's a love here there's a caring securing for nature so caring for your fellow human being and it shows your mood shows and painting the way you feel the day that you do a painting will be there for as long as that painting last it's just it's a second of time captured and stuck on canvas maybe you want to look at it that way let's do a bill to pick with all this I'm gonna come right what I find its easiest if you take your knife and scrape out a basic shape just to an old barn today what the heck maybe we'll do a big food building as I say I'm getting quite a few letters people won't see how to do a big building so we're doing a barn but so you already begin to make out the basic shapes there now come down I can't say can you see what I'm spacing out here I'd does two things it allows you it allows you to lay your building out without being committed and but it also removes that excess paint this underneath so the next layer sticks easier maybe there's some yeah maybe it comes out like yet like a tap over here maybe comes out right in here and down however you're still not committed all you've done here is just lay out a basic shape then I'm going to take the knife pull out some Ben Dyke Brown cut off a roll of paint he had a little roll of paint right on the edge there good now then let's begin laying in our shapes this is a time to start being a little more careful before you didn't matter now you want to start making big decisions maybe this old barn is a little sway back let's do an old barn years and years that's it here the old Timbers in the middle are getting a week it's like me it's tired it's ready for rest there now we can just begin blocking this in all we're doing just block it in color just in color there we go that easy and this comes down like so and we said there was gonna be some more of it came out that way yeah you know this is just hundreds of different kinds of barns so pick the kind of barn you want the principles are basically the same doesn't matter what kind of aren't you doing the principles are pretty much the same there we are now on this side we need another little protrusion so you think there we are and this paint I'm just pushing it right into the fabric I need that dark color underneath so we put some highlights on top of it it'll show up there okay just keep going down there we are and we got a pretty good old bar and shape going there already no bad let's have some fun now we can begin putting color into our bar and I'm gonna take some bright red use some dark Sienna want to dull it down it's too bright too bright unless we tell it down maybe put a little band back in there there I don't want this painting to be bright but once again if you want yours to be brighter then all you have to do is make it that way we just want to show you how to make it then we gonna turn you loose Oh in the world cut off our little roll of paint let's go right up here now then let's put some let's put some roof up here and I'm just going to let that knife just bounce it helps to make those little sounds maybe I'll make that a tiny bit brighter so you can see it a little better a little white in it don't think it's showing up as well as it should there we go now you can see just let it bounce right along there helps if you make him little sounds there once again all this to be also these the old shingles up here where they caught the devil some of them are gone somebody blow it away in the last storm the looks of it the rest of it gonna go in the next door there mm-hmm a little bit over on this side there we are shoot how we got those shingles going let's put some out here there okay where we still is that easy to actually build a barn my father was a carpenter I grew up building things I worked in houses all over Florida fact if you live in Florida you very possibly could live in the house that my dad and I worked on there and he was a master carpenter all he could do some beautiful things beautiful things let's take a little dark sienna some white pull it out very flat cut across get our little roll of pain again Allen let's put icing on the cake here look at that this is just like you're putting snow on the mountain if you painted with me before and done mountains and you've mastered that this is easy for you to do and I want to make us look like old weathered wood there there we go beautiful hmm delicate touch does not take any pressure the knife literally literally allow the paint just to come right off just the right amount little dark-eyed appear cuz our a doe into that edge a little bit of brown writing that edge there now take a little Van Dyke Brown Oh mix that same color want to darken it I want to make it darker than it was now over here it's gonna be much darker on this side much much darker just like so okay let's put a door in here big doors is right there and that's all there is to it now we can take our knife we can do a barn ectomy we just cut it off wherever we think it should be takes a strait Van Dyck Brown you can just put the indication of boards here and there there looks like a lot of old Fords now though let's have some fun we'll put some dark green grass all around his foots begin bringing that all together just use a two inch brush it's just begin playing in all kind of little grassy things just like so over here that direction I'm just using CAD yellow little Indian yellow maybe yellow ochre here in there and work in layers there came back to the other side see how quick you can do that little touch of the bright red here and there but not much not too much just enough to give it a little spark I want this to remain very subdued in the foreground here don't want it to get too bright there we go now having take some Van Dyck Brown on the knife and maybe here and there you can see what remains I used to be an old path here the grass is beginning to grow up over but here and there little of it remains just a little little bit of grass that comes out of over the path because it's about to eat this path up what's left of it say pays when you're painting like this make up little stories in your mind and there's a reason for all this happening in it how it makes it much more fun tell us let's have a little fence and take Van Dyke Brown just use a small knife maybe there's a little thin still part of it hanging out right about there just a little roll of paint on the knife there it is just an old fence or has a rough-looking Oh fancies had a hard life to the brown and white touch the edges and OOP there let's get the big knife here and let the indication of a few rails that are still hanging off there they go and then supers you can make a fence that fast put grass around the bottom cuts his little foot soft and brings it together tell you what I got just a couple of minutes left here you know me I like big trees let's have a big trees that's right there maybe he's got another arm cuts right there this is straight Van Dyke Brown their deer songs I like his big trees because it pushes everything back just makes the painting look much deeper take a little brown and white come right down this side antennas put 10 ocation of some light striking a truck there that neat okay needs some leaves on our tree we take a little black little yellow ocher mixed together very dark though very very dark maybe their lives in our world some nice leaves right out there wherever you think they should be mostly there there's something right about here and you can make these come as far you want or leave them short whatever love yellow ocher a little bit of black let's go back in here put the indication of a few highlights once again I want this to remain quite dark wanted to remain dark with it I think we're on the verge you haven't finished painting the old clock on the wall tells me bad out of time for today so from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless you
