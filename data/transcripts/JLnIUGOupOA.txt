- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today maybe we'd just do a beautiful little winter scene. So let's start out and have
them run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that,
let me tell you what I've got done up here. Have my standard old 18
by 24 inch pre-stretched, double-primed canvas but
you use whatever size is convenient and I've covered
the entire canvas with just a very thin, even coat of liquid white. So the canvas is wet, it allows us to blend color right up here. It's ready, so let's do it. Let's start today with
the old two-inch brush. Little tiny brush. We'll run into a little
bit of the phthalo blue. Phthalo blue is a beautiful,
beautiful color blue but it takes very little. So we just load a little color
into the bristles by tapping. See that ensures a nice
even distribution of color all the way through the bristles. Okay, let's go up here. Now then, let's start up in
here and just make little X's. Little criss-cross strokes. I'm gonna go all the way across the top. The color is continually
mixing with the liquid white that's on the canvas and that's why it blends
beautifully like this. If you had a dry canvas, as I like to say, you'd
be in agony city about now 'cause it just doesn't blend like this. There, that's the beauty
of the liquid white. It just allows us to
blend color on the canvas. All right. See? Something like so. A little more color on
the old brush and we'll come right in here and
do something like so. That's all. Just little cross strokes. Criss-cross strokes. Or cross-criss, whichever. Now then, sometimes I like
to make the edge of paintings a little darker so that it
intentionally will bring the eye into the center of the canvas. So for that I'm gonna add a
little bit of Prussian blue. The Prussian blue is much
darker and much stronger. And that I'm gonna apply
just to the corners. Just to the corners and then
we'll go over on this side. Put a little bit right there. There. Now very lightly we can
just blend the entire sky. I left that blank intentionally
because I think I'll have a big cloud that floats
right around there. While we have that color on the old brush, let's add a little more
of the phthalo blue. And same way, just tapping, I want a little water in this painting. Shoot, you know me. I would paint water in just
about everything that I do. I love to paint water and in
this technique it's one of the easiest things imaginable. There. Pull from the outside in. And I wanna leave a little
area of light right in there. So just pull from the outside
in and leave that there. That's all you have to do. And then very lightly just
go across the entire canvas and that little light
area will remain in there. And if everything works just right, it'll look like light
shimmering across the water when we're all done. Now comes the fun part. It's time to wash the old brush. Wash the old brush. Take off excess. (chuckles) And just beat
the devil out of it. All right. We can just stay with that
same brush and go right into a little bit of the titanium white. I'm just gonna bounce
the corner right into a little bit of white there. Okay, let's go up here. Now then, I just wanna make
some little fluffy clouds. And today I'm just gonna
do that by just tapping. Just tapping. That's all you have to do. In this series I've done
a lot of clouds like this because they're the simplest,
easiest kind of clouds that I've ever found. There. In the past series we've
showed many many other ways of making clouds. So you find the one that
works the best for you and that's the one that you want. I wanna add the least little
touch of Alizarin crimson. I wanna put a little pinkish
flavor down toward the base in this cloud. Not much, just a little. There, just to give it a hint of pink. There, like a little sunshine
is dancing through there. There we go now very lightly
just barely touching the canvas I wanna just barely
blend that a little bit, just to bring everything together. But those tap marks up here
makes a very soft little tops to your clouds and with a clean brush I'm just gonna blend it a little. Not much. Not much. You don't have to do
a lot of blending with this. 'Cause there's not a great
deal of paint on the canvas. But ain't that a nice easy way of making a big old strong cloud. Tell you what, let's give him a friend. You know me, I think everybody
should have a friend. So we'll do the same thing
and maybe, yeah right there. We'll just tap in another
happy little cloud. Or a big cloud in this case. Maybe he lives right out through here. It's up to you. Up to you. Wherever you want him. Something like that. There. Once again, a little touch of the crimson. Just to flavor it a little,
right down here at the base. Now I get my clean dry two-inch brush and we can just blend it and fluff it. There. Something as easy as that. And the more you blend it of course, the more subdued it will become and you can literally blend it away and that's the way you correct
it if you ever make a cloud that you don't like, you just blend it away,
paint you another one. We don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents. (chuckles) And all I mean by that is
that after a while you become so confident with a method
that you don't worry. Anything that happens, you
can use it in your painting to your advantage. And that happens very very quickly. Now then, today I'm gonna
make a little mountain. In the past series we've
made a lot of mountains but I still get requests
every day for mountains. That seems to be the favorite thing. There, we'll use a little black, a little bit of the Prussian blue, and some Alizarin crimson
all mixed together. But it still looks blue. Pull it out as flat as you can get it. Cut across and we have
our little roll of paint, lives right on the edge of the knife. And let's go right up in here. You have to make your
first major decision. Where does your mountain live? In our world, he lives right there. Right there. Now you have to make a lot of decisions. How many little peaks and bumps do you have on your mountain? And this is a very individual thing. You decide. You decide. And it could be a mountain
that you've seen before or it could be a mountain that you've seen only in your imagination. It doesn't matter. But it's your mountain, that's
the only thing that counts. That it's your mountain
and it makes you happy when you paint it. There. Put another one right
there, what the heck. This is a good day to
have a little exercise in painting mountains. 'Cause they're a lot of fun. And of course we're not
interested in that happy book but if you're out selling paintings, very few things sell
better than mountains. Everybody likes to have
a nice mountain painting hanging in their home. And guess what kind I have in my home. I have a house full of mountains. I love 'em. I love 'em. Probably comes
from living in Alaska so long. There we go. Take the two-inch brush and
just pull that paint out. Just pull it. Like that. Very gently. And you can just move the
paint on this wet canvas. Blend it. And if you can see the entire mountain, it's always more distinct at the top than it is at the bottom. And this is mixing with the liquid white and automatically that'll happen. Automatically. You don't
even have to worry about it. Don't even have to think about it. Just blend it. See already I see like a
nice valley right in there. When these things happen,
treat them as little gifts. Little painting gifts. Use them. I'm gonna just, see I'm
blending upward now to bring a little bit of that
liquid white up in here. I wanna lighten this even more. So it looks just like a little valley. There we go. Okay. Now. We're gonna have a little
winter scene so let's put some snow on there, we'll take titanium white, pull it out as flat as we can get it. Really mash down, cut across,
get our little roll of paint. Okay. Now then. No pressure. No pressure. Take the point of the knife, put it right at the point of the mountain. See? Just put it right
up here at the point and then let it flow but no pressure. I can't say that enough times. Can't say that enough times. Mountains are one of the most
fantastic things to paint. Just love 'em and they're
so easy like this. There. My son Steve, if there's
anything that he really excels at in painting probably it's mountains. Everywhere that I've traveled
that he's been people tell me, "His mountains sure put yours to shame." But don't tell him that. He'll get the big head and want a raise. He works for us and just
travels around and teaches. Or actually I guess he's self-employed 'cause I don't pay very well. There. Okay. Now then, these back here, I wanna make them look
like they're very far away. So I'm just gonna grab the
base of them and gently blend a little bit and that's about all I'm gonna do to them. I want them to be far away. Back here in that valley. There. Since we have a little valley there. Now, I'm gonna take some white, a little bit of titanium white, some of the phthalo
blue and mix it together like about so. There. Pull it out very flat. Once again, our little roll of paint. Normally, every time I load the knife, I load it with that little roll of paint. There. And now, just let that sort
of drift right down like that. There we go. And I want it to just gradually disappear back into this little valley here. Very quiet little thing. A little bit right in here,
don't want him left out. Something like so. Maybe even a little touch there. That little shadow though
creates the illusion of a peak or something protruding out. I wanna create a mist right here. So I'm just taking the brush and tapping. Following those angles. Most important. Then lift upward. Now, sometimes it's fun
to play little games. Take a little more white and watch here. See there? Now then, we have another whole protrusion right out through here. Another peak. That easy. But it needs a shadow, it
needs its own little shadow or it won't play with you. Just go away and leave you. Just go away and leave you. All alone. Good clean dry brush. And we can tap that a little bit. There. And right here. There we go. Now. Sometimes it's fun to play little games. Maybe you wanna create even
more depth and distance in your painting. So let's a little more of that dark color. Same old mountain color and we'll come right about here. Maybe. Maybe, yeah. We have another little
mountain that lives there. Maybe there's another peak. It doesn't matter. Whatever you want and wherever
you think it should be. But you need that dark color
in there just so it'll show. Just show it'll stand out. It separates. It's your good friend, take care of it. Our two-inch brush, grab it. Once again, just give it a little pull. Something like that. There you go. And we're gonna do exactly
the same thing again. Just take our little roll
of paint right on here on the edge of the knife and put a little bit of
snow right on this mountain. A little touch right
there on that little peak. But this painting will
give you a lot of practice with a knife and making
beautiful mountains. And don't be afraid if one
didn't come out just right. To evaluate it, scrape
it off and do it again. Because that's the way we learn, is by doing things over and over. Over and over, and it doesn't mean that you've done bad,
it means you're normal. 'Cause I'll you, there's
not anybody who has painted that hadn't scraped it off
and redone it many many times. Not if they're a good painter. You can bet they have
scraped and repainted. It's part of the price that
you pay to learn to paint. That's all. And even that is a
tremendous amount of fun. There we go. Something like so. Sometimes, watch here,
you can play little games. Maybe we'll just bring that all together. See? It all goes right together. But once again, let's put a
little shadow right in there. Something like that. There. See there? Isn't that unbelievable that
in just a couple of minutes you can make a mountain like that? And you really can. Maybe the first time you try this, it's gonna take you more
than a couple of minutes but the more your practice,
the faster you'll become. Initially, don't worry about speed. Don't even think about speed. If you wanna learn,
don't worry about speed. It comes with just a little practice. And you won't even realize it's happening. One day you'll realize what took you maybe four or five hours to do a
painting that you're doing that same painting in half the time. And then it's half again
and then pretty soon, pretty soon you could knock
these little rascals out just like we do here and
there is no editing here. What you see is actually what happens. Even the mistakes. (chuckles) There we go. I'm mixing up that same color
and adding a little white to it just to make a lighter blue. I'm gonna put some little
trees way back in the distance. And for that let's use
our little fan brush. We just load a little color on it. Something like that. I'm just gonna tap downward. Just wanna make the indication
of some little trees that live way back in the distance. Far far away. We're not looking for detail. Detail comes in the foreground. There. Okay. Back here, just indications once again. Just indications. Too much detail will ruin
the illusion of distance in your painting so don't
try to put every leaf on these little trees that
are living way back here. You don't see them in real life. There. Now, let's take our old two-inch brush. I wanna grab the bottom
of this, watch here. Decide where land and water
meet, pull straight down. Like that. Go across. And that quick. We have instant reflections. Instant reflections. We'll take a little liquid
white, pull it out very flat, cut across and we'll go right up in here and I'm just gonna cut
in a little water line using the knife straight
on pushing very firmly. Very firmly. There. Something about like that. The water line just, really
it sort of splits up these two dark colors and gives the indication of where the shore line is. Good. Now. Same old color we were using. I wanna add a little bit
more of the blue to it. Just to darken it a little. Just to darken it up. Maybe even a little more black too. What the heck. Have it all. Something like that. Okay, let me clean off the old knife. I just wipe the knife on a paper towel. Or an old soft rag, whatever you have. I'm gonna load the old fan brush back up and don't be shy here. Put a bunch of color in that brush. Shoot, get brave. Get brave. Maybe in our world there's a big foothill that lives, make a decision, Bobby. There we go, right there. See? All you gotta do is just decide. 'Cause this is your world, you
have total and complete power over this world. Can do anything. Anything that you believe you can do. All you have to do is
visualize it in your mind. See it over and over. There. And what you can visualize and believe in, believe that you can do, you can do. I know you can. Because I see pictures every day from fantastic people all over the country and they are creating some of
the most beautiful paintings. And that truly is the joy of painting. It really and truly is. Put a little detail maybe on that one. Maybe he's the big boss tree right there. There. I'm just tapping firmly. Put a little color on the canvas. Wherever. Trees grow in every size
and shape and description. Just like people. Just like people, they're different. Some are big, some are small. Some are tall, some are small, whatever. That's what makes them so fantastic. It's what makes people so fantastic. If they were all alike,
wouldn't it be dull? Phew. There we go. There we go. Okay. I'm just really filling that in. You can do this with a two-inch
brush if you wanted to. Probably be a little easier and faster. But since I have this
going, what the heck. Doesn't matter. Now, go and lift gently upward. But all those little splotches now become, look like hundreds maybe thousands of little trees. Or however many you want in your world. You make up your mind
how many it looks like. Part of it I'm gonna pull straight down. Create a reflection into there like so. Go across. When I was a traditional painter, reflections used to absolutely
drive me up the wall. Shoot, I can remember
taking painting something and then turning the
canvas upside down and trying to repaint it and make it shimmer. Reflections probably are
the easiest, simplest, quickest thing that we
do in this technique. A little liquid white here. Give the indication of
a little water lying right underneath that. Pushing very firmly, very firmly. If you ever have one here you don't like, take your two-inch brush, grab it, pull it right into the
reflections and it just goes away. Just goes away, that easy. That easy. All right, let's put some, let's put some evergreens in here. Usually when you have this
kind of scenery there's some beautiful little evergreens
living around there. Clean me off a spot to work. I want them to be very dark. So we'll start with black, Prussian blue, some crimson. We'll throw phthalo blue in
there too, it doesn't matter. Woops, it really doesn't really matter. There we go, the old knife
caught on the palette there. Sometimes I get in too big of a hurry. (chuckles) All right, load the brush
full of color again. A lot of paint, a lot paint. And let's go right up in here and decide our tree lives right there. 'Cause that's all it
takes to make a decision. Just decide. Use the corner of the brush as you work down the tree,
push harder and harder forcing the bristles to bend downward. Most important they bend downward. And underneath the limbs,
that'll make all them little hangy-down things that
live under evergreen limbs. I don't know exactly what you call them. I've always called them hangy-downs. But I bet you know what I'm talking about. Maybe it's not a proper
word but you understand. Maybe here's one that, he's got a little bend in him. Just like that. There. Okay and we'll give him a
friend that lives right there. There we are. Just back and forth. Makes a neat little
sound on the canvas too. I like that. I like the way it sounds. There we are. You know, it's really fantastic to me, when we finish this series, I think there will be 312 Joy of Painting shows. Phew. It's unreal. It literally breaks every
record in television history for an art show. 312 shows. And I'm getting a lot of
letters now from people that say we haven't seen all the shows. And so what I think I'm
gonna do, I've been talking a little bit here maybe what I'm gonna do is pick out some shows
that are my favorite, the paintings that are
my favorite paintings, and I think we're gonna put
them together in a series we're gonna call "The
Best of Joy of Painting" and let you see what my favorites are. And this way people will
have the opportunity to see how the Joy of Painting
has progressed from from the very beginning 'cause we'll just intermix these shows. I think you'll really enjoy it,
but if you'd like to see it, let us know or even better
yet let the station where you're watching this know and we'll make it available
to them very soon. We'll call it "The Best of the
Joy of Painting" how's that? Think it'll be fun. I'd like to see some of
the old shows myself. There. I'm gonna take a little
white, a little crimson, a little blue, like a
little lavendery color but sort of pinkish. There. Put the indication here and there of just a little tree trunk. Wherever you want him. There, that's enough. We'll take a little liquid
white, a little titanium white, I'm gonna grab the least little
touch of the phthalo blue and put in there. Something like so. Let's go up in here, and let's just put the
indication of a little highlight, a little snow maybe laying
out here on some of these. There, darker, darker, darker. As you work down. Darker, darker. There we go. There, yeah. Over, over and over. Okay, right on down. From here. Wherever you want 'em. There we go. Just a few here and there. Be careful and don't cover up all the dark 'cause evergreens normally
are a little darker than most trees so you don't wanna kill all that beautiful dark color. I'm gonna take some white, a little bit of the phthalo
blue on the one-inch brush and maybe in our world there lives some happy little bushes. So right now all I'm doing
is putting in a little base color for the little bushes. Wherever we think they should be. Maybe, yeah why not come
right down like that. All right. Let me get a clean one-inch brush, and dip it into liquid white. Liquid white. Let me clean off a little
spot here to work with. There we go. Liquid white. Then I'm gonna pull the
brush in one direction and one direction only. Right through the titanium white. I want to load a lot of color into that. A lot of paint into the bristles. There. Now with that we're gonna come back and just begin highlighting this. Make it look like little
snow-covered bushes that are living right out there. Just little jewels shining in the sun. Do one bush at a time. One little bush at a time. Okay, maybe there's one. Wherever you want 'em. There's another one. Okay. Here and there, there and here. And you don't have to
make all of them white, leave some of them the dark blue because they'll be in shadow. They'll be back in the shadows where the little bunny rabbit hides. There we go. We can take a little titanium white now and let's just quickly put the
indication here of a little snow right right at the base of these. Something like that. But pay attention to
angles when you do this. Don't just throw this on at random. And worse yet, don't
pull it straight down. If you do it'll look like huge cliffs. There. Something like this, there we go. And we just fill that
in, wherever you think the little snow area should be. This is a very cold winter
scene, it's all done in blues. It'll make you want to put your coat on. And I think with that, shoot, we've gotta have a finished painting. Scratch in a few sticks and twigs. Call that one done. Hope you've enjoyed it
and from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. (relaxed music)
