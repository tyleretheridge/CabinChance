- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Thought today we could do a
fantastic little seascape. So I'll tell you what, let's start out have them run all the
colors across the screen, that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, come on up here let me show you what
I've got done already. I got my standard ol' 18 x 24 inch canvas, but you use whatever size
is convenient for you. and today, I've cut a little
oval out of some contact paper, and just stuck it on. And then we covered the whole area here with just a thin, even
coat of liquid white. So it's all wet and ready to go, so. Let's just have some fun. Thought we'd do a little seascape today that seemed very warm
and make you feel good just to look at. I'm gonna start with
the least little touch of the cadmium yellow. Least, little touch. Maybe reach over here
and get a little touch of the Indian yellow,
just mix those together. Ooh, that's nice. Let's go up here. Now maybe we'll have a
little sun up in here in the sky today. So we'll just start,
and go around like this. There's not a great deal
of color on the canvas. Not much color. Just work around. I want a circle right here. Now I don't just want to go like this, cause it's very hard to blend that out. Little x's , and then paint is continually mixing with the liquid white. Alright, now, about cleaning the brush, it adds the least little
touch of yellow ochre. And go right around the outside edge. The yellow ocher is sort of a gold color. It's very very pretty color... very pretty. Alright. Now just sorta allow
those to blend together. Can you blend them? Let's wash the old brush. That's the fun part, this whole technique. Okay, shake off the excess, (laughs) I just beat the devil out of it. Alright, let's go into a little
bit of the alizarin crimson. Just a small amount. Just a small amount. And just, tap it right into the bristles. Let's go up in here,
right around these edges, we'll put a little of the crimson. And I'm starting from the outside, and working inwards. So it'll mix with the liquid white, and progressively it will get
lighter, as it works inward. There, now see these little feather edges that you create by doing
this, the little x's. They blend together quite easy. If you made very distinct lines, it would be difficult
to blend it together. Let's have a little bit
more of the crimson, for the other side,
don't want it left out. There, okay, On a good day, we just do a very very
simple little ocean scene. I live in Florida now,
and we have a lot of beautiful little ocean areas around there. Fact just the other day, my
friend Bob and I went fishing. I hooked my first Sailfish. I've never never even seen one before. And you notice I said I hooked him. Because he got off long before
I got him into the boat. But we did, before the
day was over, catch one that was just absolutely gorgeous. This thing was probably
close to six feet long. Most beautiful fish I've ever seen. And you know me. (laughs) We brought him in the boat just long enough to take his picture, and wish him well, and we
put him back in the water. He went home back to his family, he's living happily now
right off the Fort piers. There. I don't keep many fish. I think you return them back to nature, and go back and catch them another day. Or somebody else catches them. That way, everybody gets to enjoy the fun of catching a fish. There, came out and I'll just go completely across there. Now up here on the top, I'm going to use the same ol dirty brush, add the least little touch of phthalo blue and alizarin crimson, and you can just mix them on the brush. Maybe a little more crimson, there we go. What I want this to be to the blue side is this sort of a
lavender to the blue side. And we'll go back up here. And very gently, very gently we'll just throw in a little color right along the very top. Sorta let it blend down, very easy. Now then, I have several
of each brush going. I'm gonna take a clean, dry two-inch brush and just blend these two areas together. You don't want to be able to tell where one color stops,
and the next color starts. Just let them blend together, that easy. That easy. Now then. I think maybe today we're gonna have some fun, let's take and do a little finger painting, take a little touch of the titanium white, and we just rub in the indication of a
little sun right there. And with a clean brush,
very gently blend that. And it will give the
indication of a little sun up here in the sky. But it's not real bright or real distinct. It's just a quiet little
sun that lives up there, and has a good time. Let's go into a little yellow,
a little alizarin crimson, mix 'em together. Gonna make sorta a nice peachy color. Maybe a touch more of the yellow. Okay this is cadmium and alizarin
crimson, that's all it is. And let's go up in here. Very warm little painting today, so we're gonna use very warm
little colors of course. And let's take just a little
of that, on the fan brush. Tight little circles,
right across the sun there. We'll draw a little
cloud up here in the sky. Just let it float right
on back into nothing here. There, wherever. Okay. Then we'll take a dry two-inch brush and gently, gently blend that. The only reason I'm doing this
is to remove excess paint. The only reason. Now then, let's go back,
I'll take a little white, put a little tough of
the cad yellow in it. With a little yellow ochre
also, ooh that's nice. It's almost white, but
it's just flavored with a little cad yellow,
a little yellow ochre, just to give it a little flavor. let's go back up in here. Now I want to put some little
highlights on this cloud. So using just the corner of the brush, I'm gonna come right in here, and just sparkle a few
little things, not too much. Just a little, just a
little, just a little. That's it. Now back to our two-inch brush, or you can use a one-inch brush for this if you're more comfortable with it. There, and fluff it. Just enough to put a little
flavor on the topping. Now, same old fan brush, and I'm am
going to a little bright red, and white, something like so. Okay good. Now then, see if that stands out enough. Sometime you have to
sorta check to make sure it stands out just right. We'll come right down in here and and we'll put in another little cloud. There. He just sorta lives right out in here. And same thing once again, we'll take a light color, this is that same color, and we'll just highlight
this cloud a little. Just to give him a little flavor. Don't want too much here. Just a little. It's fantastic how you
can play back and forth for these little colors
and make this thing work. There. Back to our two-inch brush. But notice that we're only doing one cloud at a time. Sometimes it starts working
so good you get greedy and you want to do 'em all at once. But you need to work in layers. That way it works a lot better. Okay. Back to our color here. We had our original color alizarin crimson and yellow, yellow ochre. I want to make another one
of those peachy clouds. That live, yep, right there. There we go. Just wherever you think they should be. That's exactly, exactly
where they should be. Because this is your world here, and you can do anything in
this world that you want. Take off the excess, blend it in. And it's just playing back and
forth here, back and forth. There. And we'll put a little
highlight on that rascal. Don't need much though. Don't need but a tiny tiny bit. And then fluff him a little. There we go. Okay, now then. Maybe in our world, there lives another little pinkish
cloud, same old bright red. And I'm just doing layer
after layer of clouds here. I want to have a lot of clouds on. A lot of clouds. So here they come. One after the other. There. Same thing again, a
little bit of light color. Just to flavor it. Hmm This is going to be a beautiful little
pastel painting I think. It looks like it's
going in that direction. And they're so pretty. I beat the brush just knocking the excess
paint that's on it. This is the same one I blended
with since the beginning. So I just beat it to knock
out the excess paint. I'm lazy and it's easier
than going through the whole blending procedure. Alright. Now, let's take, we'll take
a little of the phthalo blue and the alizarin crimson, and just mix a little on the brush. Heck, I just want a little tiny bit here. A lot of the color. But this time I'm going
more to the red side. And down in here, let's put in some little cloud shapes that just float around down in here for this lavender. Using the corner of the brush, making little tiny circles. Tiny little circles, there you go. Just drop 'em in. Let 'em go. There, a little bit
more color on the brush. And we'll put some right over in here. Notice it's getting darker and darker as we get away from the sun in this because that's the light source. Everything get's darker as
we work our way from that. There we are. Okay. Shoot when we have that color maybe up here in the sky, there's a little floaters
that live up here too. Don't leave the top out. I almost got carried away there. So we'll put a couple
little floaters up in there. Maybe even, yeah why not we don't want the top left out here, we'll just have little
floaters on both sides. And very lightly. There we go. Something about like so. You know in one of the earlier shows, while I'm doing this cause
I'm just doing the same thing. One of the earlier shows
I showed a little deer, that I had the opportunity to meet. And we got so many calls
about that little rascal. I'm gonna show him to you again, see if you like this little devil. He is one of the most
precious little creatures that you could ever imagine. And I had the opportunity to spend a, about half a day with him. And Diana Schaffer, the
bird-lady here in Mosi was taking care of him. But isn't he a gorgeous
little character. (laughs) I tell you, you could
fall in love with these, and you know I just don't have the heart to shoot Bambi anymore. Once you hold one of these, you just, your deer hunting days are over. Or at least for me it is. I get so attached to 'em, I just want to keep 'em as pets. Move them right in the house. I've got enough creatures in the house. Now that's all I need is a deer running around the living room. There we are. I'm just putting in some
little sky things here while you're watching, same procedure, I'm not doing anything different. And we had to, had to
give him a little drink and you notice how big that bottle was. I think there was a coke
bottle he was drinking out of. I sure hope you enjoyed seeing him again. Okay, got a few little
clouds here and there. But see how that dark color and I just highlighted
it with the same color but it makes so many
different planes in here. The distance is so great. I only need a little of
that same highlight color. Just basically bright red, a little white, that's all I'm using. I do so to highlight these
little things up here on top too. We don't want them left out. Phew, nothing worse than a mad cloud. There. And with a big brush,
just gently blend that. That's all you have to do. That sorta brings it all together. And makes them very
effective little clouds. Time to wash a brush or two. As you know, this is my favorite thing. (laughs) Cause I get even with the crew for picking on me here. They will do too. Really get 'em. There, and we wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner. And just beat the devil
out of them to dry 'em. It's important that these brushes are dry. Now maybe we'll have some water back here. Normally if you've painted with me before, I do the bottom of
these with liquid-clear. And I do that when I don
't want to dilute color. Today I want to dilute color, I want the, I want this to be much softer. So all you have to decide
where your horizon's gonna be, take your brush, and pull across. Or you can do like we do
in some of the other ones, take the masking tape,
and put across there so you have a nice
perfectly straight line. But what the heck. You just take the brush
and do it, either way. A bit more color. There we go. And I thought, as I said, I
thought today we'd just do more of a Florida-type seascape. Instead I like to do the
ones from the West Coast where you have big rocks and
cliffs, and crashing waves. But let's just do a
little quiet one today. My friends in Florida have got onto me because I haven't really
done many Florida seascapes. There so we take, now
that the brush is going, put a little crimson
right on the same brush. And you'll add it right in here. Just alizarin crimson
right on the same brush. So we have a lavender,
to the reddish side now. Little more of the
crimson, ooh that's nice. Okay, that's looks very pleasant. And just sorta blend 'em together. Now then, have to make some big decisions. Let's figure out first of all, where our major waves are gonna be. If we're gonna have a
little, a little crash here. Come right up in here,
let me show you how to get that, just figure out
basically where it's gonna be. If I take just a little white paint on the fan brush or
the script liner brush, and lay in a basic shape
for the major wave. And other than that, we don't much care. Other than that, that's our main point. Just take white paint,
lay that little rascal in. Now your wave's gonna
crash over like that. That helps you put a little
do'er in there like that. In the background back here,
a little white on the brush. We can just begin putting the indication of all kinda of little things. Use a little rocking stroke, and I'm really exaggerating there. But, so it gives the
impression of little waves that are happening, way back in there. There, let all these
little things just happen. But don't kill all your dark color. If you kill all the dark color, of course you don't have any dark left. There we are. And we just let it go on right over there. Here I'm just gonna blend that paint back. Just blend it back. But it's most important that you save a dark area right there. Most important. That gives the trough
in between little waves. Since this is going to be
a Florida-type seascape, we don't want a lot of
crashing waves here. Waves are pretty calm in Florida. Unless you have one of the
big hurricanes that come. Then they get a little wild. Alright, now this water's gonna come here. And just sorta crash over. Not a big crash, just a little crash. Something like so. There we go. Tell you what, let me
grab a Filbert brush, I like him for this. Put a little titanium white
on that little Filbert brush and let's begin making
some little, little things that are crashing up here. (fake wave crashing) Gotta make those little noises. Put a little, let's put
a little lavender on. Make a shadow, for our little crasher. This is just phthalo blue
a little alizarin crimson, maybe, at least a little
touch of black in there too. Yeah, there we go, I like that. Sorta let that come right on around. Wash the old brush. Now these brushes we just
dry on a paper towel. It's sorta hard to beat
them, it's not enough to get in there and work with. Back to titanium white, there. Now we can highlight that. Just give it a little upwards push. Something like so. And then very gently, again
blending that together a little. Okay. Let'a take a little one-inch brush, and very lightly go in
here, just the corner, and just blend that together. You can make it as soft as silk. There we are. Very light. Now, let's take some white, least little touch of the
cad yellow mixed together, just white, a little cad yellow, I use a little fan brush
but you can use anything, it doesn't matter. We'll go right up in here,
this is the eye of the wave, or the transparency,
whatever you want to call it. Let's just put in a little
color right in there. And let it blend outward. So there's a little light
zinging through the water. Now the blue and the yellow
here will mix together, and make it a very nice green color. Now with a, you can use a
one-inch or a two-inch to do this. Just gently blend it, just blend it. In little tiny circles,
till it all comes together. And there, so now we have a little eye. Let's have some fun. Shoot, I'll take a little knife, and a little touch of the titanium white. And in my mind, we have a little ripple right there. I put it on with a knife,
I'm using a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure. You can put in a few
little things like that. There's a little cad yellow in there, a little bright red too sometime. Just sorta let all those
colors just happen. There, now with a clean fan brush, very lightly, you grab
that, and take it back. Try not to destroy that nice edge. Just take it back. And again blending it together. This is where you make
the shape of the wave. The curl. whatever you want to call it. Now sometimes it's fun, right underneath our light source here, take pure white, pull down. Just pull it down. Very firmly. And then go across. Like that. Now back to our little knife. Redefine that edge, I sorta messed it up. And let's have another
little ripple that lives right about here. We go right over that spot
that looks like a reflection, and it's gorgeous. Cause you'll be able to
see right through there. People will wonder, "How in
the world did you done that?" And it's so easy, it really is easy. And, I need a clean fan brush and I'm about out of them. I'm about to wash one. And very gently, blend that back. But you need a clean brush. Very lightly, and do this
as gently as you can. You don't want to destroy
these nice shiny areas that you have in your water here. So be careful, don't destroy those. Okay, we can take our little liner brush, a little bit of white on
it, and here and there. This is, you can begin
bringing all this together. All kinds of little lines and ripples and things going on wherever. But this is where you really
begin forming and shaping your way, a little dark
line underneath there will separate that. A few little things that
you can see through, the transparency. There. And at home, when you're doing this, put a lot of these little rascals in here. They'll really make your painting special. There we go. And then, let's take, let's
have a little sand dune today. What the heck. For that, I'm gonna take black, black, black, black, a little bit of, let's get a little bit
of that Van Dyke brown, maybe a little dark
sienna, and some white. I wanna brownish-grey color, maybe a little crimson in there too. Oh that's better, that's much better. Almost a, yeah something like that. Now that, let's decide where
our little sand dunes live. Maybe, yeah there you go. We just put in a basic shape here. That's all we're looking for. Wherever. Maybe he's got a friend right there. And just paint over anything. Don't worry about it. You haven't wasted your time
if you learned to make these. Maybe that comes right on down there. So we just see a little bit of it through. There we go. Just put a little color in there. And that's only so our
lighter color will show. Take a little touch of white, and it's got the least little
bit of that bright red, the least little bit. Pull it out, get our little roll of paint, and very lightly just barely grazing it. Figure out where the little
tops are in your sand dunes. Wherever you want 'em. There, see. Maybe they come right
on down through there. I don't know. Wherever, wherever. Maybe there's a little, yeah,
right in there somewhere. See we're barely touching,
just let the paint break. Let it break. There, here and there I'm gonna add the least little touch
of like a lavender shadow here and there. Just to sparkle it up some. Okay, now that we can take the fan brush, we'll put a little sap green on it, a little green, a little bit of brown, and I want to go right in here, and just pop in some little things. I'm gonna add a little
paint thinner to that. I want it a little thinner. A little thinner, yeah. Just pop in some little doers like that. This is gonna end up being
some little weeds up here. Maybe in our world, yep, right here, look. I have one coming right over. Wherever you want 'em. Wherever, we'll put some right up in here. Let them follow right down. There's one. But this paint's a little bit thinner. Put a little paint thinner in. And I take a little paint thinner, go into the dark sienna,
and back through that greenish color, but mostly dark sienna. Let's go up in here,
this paint here is thin. So we can grab it, and
start lifting upward. And make, just the indication of some little Sea Oats and
stuff that live out here. There we go. Something about like that. Maybe a few over here on the other side. And you can just take
a put a little things on the end sometime, they have 'em. That's why they call 'em Sea Oats. It looks like a little,
wheat growing out there. Now going into a little
bit of light color, this is white with a little
touch of the yellow in it. And we'll put in a few little light colored ones here and there. We don't want them all dark. And they'll show up good against that. There, something like so. As many or as few as you want. And we can just take our fan brush, little white and grab the bottom of that, pull it a little, and
bring all this together. It's a very nice way of making
a simple little seascape that I think you'll really enjoy doing. Alright we'll that I think we
have about a finished picture. Let's take a contact paper
off now, and see what we have. (paper peeling) As they say, this is the moment of truth. And I think you'll like this one. Try this one, let us know how you like it. And from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. (cheery music)
