[Music] [Music] hi I'm glad you could join us today thought today would just do a fantastic little painting it's very easy and I think you'll enjoy it so let's start out and run all the colors right across the screen there that you'll need to paint along with us while they're doing that let me show you what I've got done up here already had my standard old pre-stretch double prime canvas and I've taken a little bit of black gesso and just actually used a paper towel here and just sort of put in a basic shape you use a paper towel or a sponge or foam brush works well I thought maybe the day would have a little river that's coming around here and I want to show the indication of little stones under the water so I took a little bit of white gesso and black gesso and mixed it together to make a nice grey gesso an old filbert brush and I just made the indication here of a lot of little stones just very quickly but let all that dry completely then we've covered all the dark area here all across the bottom liquid clear the top we put a little bit of liquid white on like we normally would but a big thing is here let the black gesso dry completely all this dry completely before you put the clear and the white on that's the reason we had to do it before the show started and with that let's take our old two-inch brush go right into the phthalo blue and let's just put a happy little sky in this painting we'll just put a little blue in the brush go right up here and just begin making little crisscross strokes let's just make a gorgeous little painting out of this one this one do just make you feel good maybe we'll maybe we'll have some big clouds in the sky so tell you what let's just leave some areas open here or maybe this may be your clouds we'll live there I don't know exactly where they'll be somewhere in here so we'll just leave some open areas some some holes in the sky something about like that a little more color and let's go right over here a little bit right in there between those gonna be some big trees in here have him take a little bit the midnight black little Prussian blue I'm gonna just darken the dark in the corners here a little bit just just to make it a little more attractive when it's finished okay over there the corner we'll do the same thing something about like that that's really all we need yeah then very gently here I'll just sort of blend this together to get rid of any any harsh edges and we'll come back and we'll put in some clouds there we are okay and in the most fun part of all let's washio brush um I just like to I like to wash this brush it's a lot of fun there I shake off the excess mm-hmm just beat the devil out of it there now then I'm not going to a small very small amount of the alizarin crimson just a very small amount I want these clouds to have a little a little pinkish hue to them so we'll take a little at crimson go right up in here and very lightly in this area I'm just going to put a little crimson just so it'll show through with the clouds in there something about like it okay yeah shoot we'll just use little big Brush it's working pretty good for us we'll tap in a little titanium white and let's start up in here and just begin putting in some basic cloud shapes generous just titanium white that's all we're using here because we already had some crimson on the brush we have blue and crimson already on the canvas and it's continually continually gonna mix so automatically you're gonna get all kinds of little variations anyway there let's just sort of blend that layer out blend out the base oven fluff them a little bit just a little and very lightly very lightly just go over just to sort of blend them all together go back into her white and maybe there's another little layer here but work on one layer of clouds at a time don't get greedy sometimes it gets it gets working cut and feels good you just get carried away did one little layer at a time yeah then let's take that one just just blend it out here on the bottom - lets blend it out and we'll fluff it a little bit there see there's a little separation between them a little bit more white maybe yep right there we have just another happy little cloud they just float around here and have a good time all day good time there we go I think you're going to enjoy this painting the the black jessalyn and then the use of some colored Gesell's and liquid clear makes beautiful beautiful effects we've tried to we try to devote a large part of this series to show that because I've had so many cards and letters from people asking about it so thank you gonna enjoy this one I have seen I have some good ideas here we'll just see if we can pull them off there maybe little cloud just floats right along in here I don't know who he lives we have a huge big cloud that lives in her in our world already shoot'em maybe there's a little over in here too can see he's just a little soft cloud now then I'm fluff it and very lightly three hairs and severe just bring the entire canvas and that easy we got some pretty good old clouds there some of the hedges you can just you can just fuzz them out and then just float around cuz you don't you don't always see the entire cloud it just sort of gets softened you're sort of flipped around there Nandan cheap let's have some fun maybe back here in the background take some black blue little brown little crimson pression blue now I don't want this to be very dark someone take some white and Nixon I won't paint a little mountain I think it lives we read back in the distance far away I want just a color about like that our little rule of paint let's go up in here and decide maybe we have a little mountain yep it's right in there just wherever you want him to live but a little bump here and little bump there here bump there bump wherever you want there these are far far away bounce so we don't get too big or too bright they're far away far away and we take our 2 inch brush just like we normally do when we paint mountains and just pull that down just pull it down like so something about like in okay let's take a little bit of the titanium white pull it out as flat as we can get it really get tough with our and go down there we go cut across you get that little roll of paint you'll do that again so you see it goes out flat just cut across say a little roll of paint there's right on the edge of the knife so all there is to it flatten cut across okay then with that let's put some nice little highlights and shadows on here all kinds of little things this is just a little baby mountain that's we back here in the distance a little bit right in there wherever you want to say there no pressure absolutely no pressure though just pretend your whisper floating through there just barely caressing the mountain take a little blue a little blue and white little blue I mix it together cut off a little roll of pain again that we can go up in here and we can just begin laying into indication of all kinds of little shadows that way back here there we go maybe this one comes to right on through push that over and right back into the distance a little bit of shadow in there thing to sneak right in but it in give the indication of little little mountain that lives there there you at all kinds of little details don't want too many details though because we want these mountains to be far away but too much detail in them they'll begin to look too close to you we don't want that we want to keep them back here in the distance stay back mountains there now take a clean very dry two inch brush just tap they said I want to create mist down here at the base so it'll be far away far away there we go so here is we back in the distance back here now now then mistake I work pretty good we just keep going here we take a little crimson the white a little bit of phthalo blue gonna make sort of a lavender e color we use a two inch brush just tap a little bit right in there and push it they just give it shove it like yeah kids go up in here and with that maybe back here there lives a little footy Hill she just a little foothill we back in the distance just tap I did a basic shape then I'm gonna using very short little strokes lift upward make it look like little distant trees far away far away they live we back here a little more the same colors put together because I want another one and we're going to make it a little darker that way it'll indicate that it's closer to us in the landscape as you know as things get closer to us they get darker and value so we'll use the same color only darker and maybe yep you're right I like to put several layers sometimes in these little foothills because it it helps for the illusion of distance again and I think it's so important in a painting there now we just pushed that mountain back another five miles maybe we don't know but it lives way back here now far away far away didn't need that you can push mountains around you can do that you can do that alright maybe we'll put some last trees right in here and for that let's use let's use clean off a spot to work black Prussian blue alizarin crimson glow green I like little green and trees sometime there we got nice dark color make wipe off the old knife and maybe today we'll let's use the old fan brush what the heck load a lot of color in there a lot of paint we're gonna put gonna put maybe there's some evergreens that live right here you have to make a big determination some of them are about that tall some are short some are big some are little there we go a little Mountain reminds me we were we were in Mexico City here a while back and there was gorgeous mountains around Mexico City Popo and all kinds of mountains they are gorgeous and until I went there and ever realized Mexico had so many mountains you know I our program is playing in Mexico and many many other foreign countries now and I want to share with you some of our instructors there and some of the fantastic things are doing I got a couple of photographs here first of all let me show you this they they took us out on a boat to the floating gardens to paint the floating gardens and this was Bob here getting ready to go out on a beautiful boat they had really decorated it nice and a lot of fun out there and here's a net with some of her instructors and not fuzzy haired guy thanks mean good looking gather on the right is Lulu and young ladies a good friend of mine her father works with us there I'm just putting in little trees where you watch this here's a net with some of our instructors we have certified instructors in Mexico now that oh they're doing gorgeous paintings just gorgeous and they can really paint a net has really really done a fantastic job working with them and now they're sharing the joy of painting with many many people all over Mexico and we we really thank them for this a lot of fun there I won't get to go to Mexico again very soon and spend some time with some of the most fantastic friends there see there but we're just putting in all kinds of little trees that he'll also helps give the illusion those mountains live much farther back just keep pushing things farther and farther back in this painting there we go there see there but all we're doing here is just tapping downward real easy sometimes it you can pick out a tree too and just give it a little side word pulled it makes it look like little limb sticking out I wouldn't do it to all of them because they're too far away too far away you'll learn that illusion of distance but a few here and there makes it sort of interesting all right and okay let's have some fun let me find the clean brush there's one I got several old brushes going so I'll have to spend every minute of my time just washing brushes because it's it's the fun part take a little bit of phthalo blue here now then let's take this little blue it's very transparent and paint right over the top because we have liquid clear here so it's slick and wet and we can do that let's paint right over the top of the water watch what happens watch what happens intent fantastic all of a sudden we can see through the water we can see right through the water but you have to use a transparent paint and phthalo blue Prussian blue both are very transparent there we go see there isn't that sneaky I used to work so hard to try to create the illusion of rocks and stones under water now we put a few ripples on here it'll look even better but that easy that's really all you have to do all you have to do okay why that's a gorgeous looking little streamer I might take out a nice little touch it's a little green to an end there okay now then maybe in our world wipe off the old fan brush here it's got some that dark tree color and I'm going to yellow and maybe in our world here and we have a little bit of nice green little grassy areas it grow back here okay so let's go up in here and we can do that by just deciding where they live and giving a little upward push a little upward push and it goes way back in here my captaincy and you can lift it up right if you want to make it look like little bushy things here and there just all kinds of little things and in your world you create any kind of illusion that you want any kind of illusion that you want nice little grassy areas here see they're there they come that easy though okay now maybe we have a little dark sienna a little white and with that we'll make up a little brown color maybe a little more the darks an ender yeah let's come in here but indication of some have some land right under this see there mm bad easy maybe it goes way back in here somewhere I don't know where it goes this little stream or river hit me onder's we back in there we don't know where it goes don't know that we even care let's take a little liquid white here I'm gonna take a least little touch at a low blue and put in it just enough to give it a little bluish tone not much much though just enough to flavor it good cut across get our little bit of paint right on the edge of knife and then let's go up in here and begin putting some water lines right over the top of this transparent water that we made there maybe this comes out through here we can still see through the water can see right through it shoot a bit if you look close there there's a big old trout just float right down the river taking life easy and enjoying it that certainly is a pretty place to live I'll tell you that alright now then let's go back to our nice dark color and we'll have I'm just putting a little dark paint on there cuz I'm gonna put some light color on top of it and I want to stand out I want it to mix with that dark color don't have to do much because of black gesso there I just want enough paint on there so it mixes with the color we're gonna put on top something like it don't even matter if you covered good something about like heaven let me just try the same old brush we've been reading to the yellow little SAP green little yellow ocher there see all those colors and then just give it a little tap see you're just pushing that paint push it loads a little bit of paint around the end edge of the brush now we can go up here with that and just touch we can begin putting all kinds of little grassy areas that live back in here just by touching and the more you tap on this the more it's going to mix that color that's underneath that's reason we put it under there and it'll get darker and darker and darker there see now that's the area this is going to be a big tree right here that's the area behind the tree now we can take some dark color and we had to make our first major decision in tree business or it is our big old tree live when we put some black gesso up here so we know basically where it's going to be there and I don't cover all those black juice thanks either some of them showing through over here and when the paintings all done people will actually see foliage that's behind the tree and he'll go crazy trying to figure out how you did that and that's our secret there we go that's our secret but you can share with everybody if you like that may be most fun of painting is when you share it with other people I get letters every day from people that have started painting from watching this show in it they did a painting for a friend or relative and let him watch and do the painting in that and the friends absolutely if they hadn't seen it could not believe that they're doing it and they are in our newsletter we just we just shared the picture of a lady who's entered 90s I was painting now and she's doing a fantastic job this is just a little brown and white just want to put the indication here and there and there in here wherever of a few little trunks I will put some leaves on here and we're probably going to lose most of those but if some of them show through that's wonderful all right dip the little oval brush right into us and liquid white I will go into little CAD yellow little SAP green yellow ochre Indian yellow all those colors push that little brush to load it give it a little push can't go up in here now let's put some gorgeous little leaves up here this little oval brush to some of the neatest leaves they just literally just just almost fall off your brush there they go something about my cat but think about shape and form don't just throw them on at random I know I say that every time I use any brush to do leaves but that's so important think about shape and form gotta give this old trees and character they're down here we let him get darker and darker darker we need those dark shadows down at the bottom to give him depth there a little bit over in here but doesn't that make some beautiful shapes for your trees and it almost happens automatically almost automatically lovel brushes really neat all right shoot we find all brush we were making some grassy areas with and we'll just start bringing them right on down these are in front there so there here we are keep on coming down with those and you can really practice a little with this and you can make grass it's just looks like velvet nearly laying it there maybe in our world this is a nice little bush it lives right here under the tree so we'll put some nice leaves on him just using the corner the old two-inch brush he didn't matter whatever brush makes makes you happy there I have a little bit more the dark color I see another bush Libs right there once again I'll leave some of that black gesso behind there and let it show through yes it'll make it that make it look real Nita back to our little oval brush put a few little highlights on that little little baby tree there little baby tree but he'll grew up to be a big tree he just needs a lot of water and sunshine love affection same as all of us there something about like so back to our brush it has some nice little color on it here with will just continue on making all kind of little grassy areas I know what we need take a little brown we need some dirt out here so we just use a little Brown here and there little brown and white for some touch a highlight I don't want a lot of highlight on this maybe just a little don't want to distract from the water he waters what's important in this painting just a little there we go their sink something like so just keep tapping it in there okay as I say the more you tap does the soft rid of the code it'll get so neat they're just layer after layer after layer wherever you think it should live bring some right down in here all right we watch this old oval brush I'm gonna take and go ah shake off the excess go right through some Van Dyck Brown where'd it get it loaded with color then the other side a little more paint thinner needs to be thin take a little white and brown on the other side I need a little black on the dark side so one side we have full of light color the other we have full of dark and let's just go out up in here and maybe maybe there's some big rocks that live around here see you you can make them in one stroke a little black brown a little white but these little stones and rocks wherever you think they should live something like so wherever okay a little bit of liquid white put a little water line right around these stones look at there and that need to trap this idea with putting rocks under water just see what kind of things that you can come up with you'll be amazed at what what'll happen just a little bit of practice do it with all colors of different different colors under here with gesso and a little acrylic paint and I think you'll be very satisfied with the effect together okay scratch a few sticks and twigs here there I think we're about to a finish painting hope you like this one is a little different anything we've done before give you a whole new idea to work with from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and god bless my friend [Music] you [Music] you [Music]
