welcome back certainly glad you could join me today it's a fantastic day here now I hope it is wherever you are I thought today we do a beautiful little seascape and I'm going to show you a very simple way to make a very effective seascape so I tell you what let's start out today and haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and as usual they'll come across in the same order as I have them on the palette starting with the white and working around while they're doing that come on up here let me show you what I've done today we have a standard old sized canvas up here the bottom part I've covered with black gesso now I know there's going to be a wave in here and I've left the eye the wave open right in here the rest of it I just painted with black gesso the top I've just covered with liquid white as as we normally do down here after the black gesso was good and dry I've covered the center of it here with just alizarin crimson then the edges on each side with leather and crimson a little phthalo blue and then out here with a little bit of Van Dyck brown and dark Sienna mixture that's also we have brown on the outside sort of a lavender and then alizarin crimson in here I thought today we'd do a a beautiful little scene maybe it has like a little sunset in some big clouds and I don't know let's just have some fun and do it let's be crazy let's start out today with some CAD yellow a little bit of cadmium yellow and it's such a fantastic day it's bright and shiny tell you what let's make a painting that's the same way let's take a little yellow and get braved they just go right up here in the sky and just put a big big ol yellow mass right up in here son of a gun just be brief then without cleaning the brush we'll go right back and grab yellow ocher same way there just half a little in the brush you didn't really matter how you loaded down here at the base of this will put some yellow ochre it's a very nice golden color there we go now then still without cleaning the brush I'm going right into bright red just once again tap a little on the brush and we'll blend it right into the base here there mmm those colors make you feel good already they're just nice bright warm and cheery makes you feel good we'll wash the brush wash it off shake off the excess then just beat the devil out of it now that I'm gonna go into titanium white with a corner of the brush only just the corner then we'll go back up here and right up here I want to be the brightest area in the sky so I'll put that corner of the brush right up here and blend it just blend it outward there then we just bring all this together and that won't look really bright until we put some other things in the sky and then I guarantee it'll jump right out at us okay now let's finish up the rest of the sky here we'll take a little blue little blue reach up in here and get some black so I have black and blue or blue and black whichever now then using little crisscross strokes we'll just apply a little color up into the sky here there just bring it right down to this but we don't want to touch yet blue blend in a second just like so a little bit over on the other side there okay once again I'm gonna wash the brush there we are it's a good exercise in brush washing and nothing else now with a good clean dry brush we can begin blending all this together just blend it together and that will soften it smooth it blend it and I beat the brush only to remove excess paint as you pick up paint off the canvas then you can just beat the brush a little bit and blend it right out that way you don't have to go through the whole cleaning procedure there give it another little knockin we'll go right up here but you can do that several times and that will keep your brush nice and clean and fresh shoot we get a very nice guy already there okay now let's get crazy today tell you what let's take a lizard crimson and a little bit of phthalo blue we're gonna make a last lavender color here but proportionately we need much more crimson than blue the blue is very strong and it's difficult to tell what color that is so you take a little white without here and then you can check it out and see if it's what you want maybe we'll have a little more blue in there there we go pick the paint totally up off the pallet turn it over okay let me clean my knife and then let's just use the old one-inch brush they load a little paint in there it's no big deal however you want to load it and maybe maybe maybe in our world that lives just beautiful little cloud that floats around up here now this lavender color you can mix with yellow without a turning green and of course the blue doesn't hurt it so it's a nice neutral color that you can use with both of these without getting in trouble there maybe this comes right on around less and less pressure want to get softer there we go maybe I don't know if the canvas shoot who knows this is your boil so you do anything that you want to do here I have a piece of just plain masking tape across here just to keep the horizon nice and straight I want the horizon to be very straight and that's only reason it's there there we come meaning just where ever you want to just sort of let your imagination go here just make all kinds of happy little things there may be some little little stringy things that live up here okay now the clean dry brush I'm just going to work this a little bit all this does is remove excess paint I want to highlight these clouds so the more paint that you can remove the easier the next step will be there once again just knocking off excess paint then let's begin blending this and working with it there we go that all kinds of beautiful things happen here a lot of times if you if you're out selling paintings and of course we're not interested in making that happy buck but if you should be if you're out selling paintings a lot of times people buy paintings more for color than for content and this is one of those Rascals that will sell like hotcakes if you're interested and the only reason I mentioned selling paintings to me when you when you sell a painting and someone's worth willing to buy something that you made with your hand and it a scene that came out of your mind then selling is just sort of your report card it says you've done a good job let's take some white be right back get a little touch of the bright red just a little touch it's very strong it'll set your whole world on fire in just a second just a little bit now then let's go up here and just begin highlighting these clouds just right on the top up here there we go wherever you want pretty little things going on little tiny circles though bring some of it right around my cat there and here sorta let your imagination go there okay sort of follow the basic shapes to have in your vineyard clouds here let it wander around a little right in here there we don't know clouds are very free they just float around the sky and have fun all day and that's the way you should pay them very loose very free happy little things okay now we can come back with our good dry brush use just the top corner and very very gently very gently blend this tiny little circular strokes with just the top corner of the brush tiny little strokes there don't overwork it don't overwork it is almost a tendency to keep going it gets gets towards good hmm and you just keep going and going and going and pretty soon it's just all mushed together knock off the excess paint a gift and very lightly we can begin blending this just fluff it to lift it work with it there and very lightly will just blend the entire sky three hairs and some air okay and this is a fantastic way of making a very effective sky where this in a landscape or seascape went or summer beautiful and you can change the colors and just to fit the season or your particular mood their mean looking sky okay let's have some fun now I'm going to take off the masking tape and as I say that was there only to preserve this nice straight water line and we already have color up there so let's take a fan brush today and we'll go right into a little bit of titanium white and just load some color onto the bristles both sides just back and forth now then let's come back to this horizon and very gently and when you do this let me exaggerate I'm making strokes like this and I'm really exaggerating now and those little strokes little rocking type strokes like it helped create that illusion of waves that are far far away leave some dark areas in there and we have to make a decision maybe there's a sort of a large wave right here so we come in here I can't it's obvious - it doesn't look much like a wave yet but it will okay now you take a clean dry fan brush and all you worried about it's a dark area right in here watch what happens grab this and begin blending the color back just begin blending it back and angles are very important here see what happens then and that easy it begins creating that illusion of water moving back there and we'll come back and highlight those and really make them stand up now then now then somewhere in here we're going to have a big crasher so we have to start making some decisions let's go right up in here and apply some color this is just basically white Lee's little touchy yellow in it there just let it work right I don't know wherever you want it to go and then we take a large brush be sure it's clean and very dry and just barely touching barely touching just sort of wind it up the bristles are not moving much it just blends everything together very softly there just let it work right on out and that color that you have on the canvas the Crimson's and the lavenders and all those beautiful colors begin working their way through there we don't want this way to get too big you want to stay quite small yeah then take a little white come right along this edge take our large brush and once again just blend it pack that blending bag makes the little trough in between the waves a little light area see how they push that wave right back okay - we're having some fun now then back into our white load a lot of color onto the bristles least little touch of yellow into that least little touch and then we have to make some big decisions here where is our wave crashing over maybe kind of make a little noises there Karaca there it goes just a little bit okay let that color just zoom right over there you begin forming but the wave there from that angle that probably won't look just right when it comes straight on you'll see the difference though let's take let's take our number three fan brush take a little bit of lavender color mix a little white whether this is lizard crimson phthalo blue but i got the number three fan brush we're going to have some foam splashing up in here and all we do is take the corner of the brush and just turn it wiggle it there comes and start working on basic shapes come right on up right on up see there and fantastic this is the most fun to do in a seascape this particular part and all we're doing is putting the shadows on right now the dark part to the splash then we'll come back and we'll put the light areas in sometimes it's so much fun you want to put the light areas in immediately and then it's difficult to put this part in put the shadows on first and then work on you then work of the good easel okay let's go right into titanium white we load some color ahead on it's still number three fan brush okay now then let's begin putting in some beautiful little splashy push upward with that brush the foam patterns splashing patterns here are created on that upward stroke just let them come right on around here there see how you let that just crash just just think about water splashed and crashing and that's beginning to mix with that dark shadow color we put in there and it gets darker and darker back here and this will happen automatically for you you don't have to worry about it let the canvas work paints the colors there we go and sometimes I live in Florida and in Florida we don't have big rocks and stuff but sometimes you just want to make a little tiny simple seascapes all you have to do is just touch the top of a wave like it and it creates those little waves either just touch so if you want to do a Florida seascape that's all it amounts to it and you can pull a little bit of that color down a very simple way to make a nice little seascape and that's all it takes but I thought today would do one's a little more fun now that the corner the two inch brush we want to just blend this gently gently two hairs into some hair barely caressing the canvas just touch that let it blend together there now maybe maybe the light shining through here and maybe we have a big reflection coming all down so let's just do something like yes just put a little color straight down grab a big brush bike so see it mixes with all those colors around there and all those beautiful things just happen very lightly go across then look like much right now but as we begin working on that it'll look like a shimmer in there and just beautiful things now maybe there's a little wave oh there it is you knew it was there right there in the front and once again we'll blend it back just blend it back the strokes and angles are very important here that little rocking just blend it right up in there darker darker darker over here okay and then shoot let's get crazy let's take a little white I'm gonna mix the least little touch if they look blue with it just the least little touch I just wanted to have sort of a blue cast yeah then let's take the small knife let's go in here we have to start making some determinations a little roll of paint and smaller maybe come right up in here maybe there's a little little watery thing it comes over right in here and push very hard very hard just allow that to come right across but you're putting a little Ridge of paint right out here all right now we can take a clean fan brush and very gently grab this and we get blending it back just grab it and blend it back there think about angles and what's happening in this storm don't just don't just pull it back at angle it needs to be flat to make that water lay down and hearing there maybe there's some hair there just last little things happening but this is where you make the water move up and down and however you want to do these little things in here and I tell you it may be back in here we have some big rocks you know me I like these big rocks and seascapes to me it makes it more interesting but you don't have to have them in yours I'm just going to take some Brown just plain old Van Dyke Brown and a little dark sand in it a little lavender here and there - what the heck whatever dark color you have them have let's just fill that in so even this rock I had painted the basic shape in with a black gesso there tell you what maybe maybe maybe maybe there's another Rock yeah there we are lives right there just a nice little rock friendly little rock maybe over the other side here does have a rock over here we don't want this side left out same color in all we're doing here is just applying a very basic shape just blocking in color and this probably won't hardly even show at this point I'm going to add a little black in this one just darken it up even more on this side to be very dark so a little black right down here in the corner I will put a bump of pyramus rock whatever you want anyway that you wanted now that color will allow us to Lao to paint other colors over to beautiful things happen we will have a little beach up here so I'll take a little white and let's just go up in here and because we put brown on the canvas instantly we have land there we go just like so now if you want to show reflections under here so you can just grab the edges of this pull down and go across and that'll make it look wet just like that hand it let's take a little tape it'll take some white put some weight on here grab a little bit of the lavender color and maybe I'll add touch more crimson to it oh that's nice just load some of the fan brush now then let's begin shaping these rocks here now you can do this with a liner brush take your time and put all kinds of things in it sort of hard to do it in the time frame that we have here but at home you do it whichever way works best there we go see but this is how you can literally shape and form all kinds of things happening in your rocks you can just tap it make just the indication all you're looking for is the highlights in the rocks there okay so I'm out here and wherever you want to wherever wherever there's another thing it's happening right about there let's see how easy those are now then we'll take a large brush and very gently following the angles we just caress it just enough to move the pain a little don't want to destroy all those little lines and marks that you put in there just enough to move it but look at all the different planes in there can't let's go over the other one do the same basic thing over in here since our light sources in the center there we are here comes another one so you just sort of look at it and decide where you think all these little things live and play there the hair we are hmm make all types of shapes er maybe there's another one oh there it is right on down just like so wherever you are there's one and everybody's gonna have different kind of rocks in there painting so don't worry about if they don't look just like these are just like just like lenses somebody else done okay I would take our large brush and once again very lightly just enough to just enough to distort a little bit it's sort of like when we do reflections we don't want to get carried away just enough to move it there maybe shoot let's get crazy here I'll take the little knife I'll go right back into that blue maybe there's another little ripple that lives right here there it is there it is Slaney and very lightly blend it back just like before and then we're the liner brush a little paint thinner let's go back in here and I want to firm up this edge so it stands apart and then just just gently blend it on in just to make it stand out and put some little lines in here indicating little foamy things that are happening this is what shapes your wave paint should be very thin and it'll literally flow say even back in here you're all kinds of little little watery movements there but these little details this is what really makes your seascape special come right along here soon there we are they're just all kinds little thanks I'll see you right around right around the stove there son that easy and under this thing here little dark line will help set that off make it really stand up and at home when you're doing this spend some time with it just put all kinds of little details in here you'll be absolutely amazed at what an effective and beautiful seascape you can make in just a matter of minutes no clock on the wall tells me it's about time shut it down for the day I hope you've enjoyed this it'll really give you a nice little thing to do in its beautiful colors it'll make you happy in here so from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless
