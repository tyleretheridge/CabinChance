- Hi. I'm glad to see you today. Today I thought we'd do something just a little bit different and we'll just have a good time. Before we get started I'm going to have them graphically run all the colors that you need right across your screen and you can see exactly what colors I have on my palette and it'll come across on the screen
starting with white and going right around,
same way I have them on the palette. And today I'm going to
use just a dry canvas and we'll have some fun with that. I'm going to dip my brush into a little bit of paint thinner and I'm going to right
into some Thalo Blue, just a small amount and I want
this paint to be very thin and I'm just going to
put a quick little wash on the canvas, just a little bit of color. There we go. And this is just a little Thalo Blue with a lot of paint thinner in it. Very, very thin and it'll dry
on your canvas quite rapidly. I want a little bit of this
blue color to show through my painting and it'll make it very nice. There we go. Just cover the whole canvas with it. And there we are. That quickly had the canvas
completely covered with color and we can start having some fun. Now when you're doing this at home try numerous colors. Burnt umber, van dyke
brown, pression blue. All of these colors work very, very nice and they're very, very transparent. Okay I'll wash the brush. There we go. And let's have some fun. Let's have some fun. We'll take some titanium white, put on the knife. I'm just going to pull it out very flat and then cut across and
get a little bit of paint right out here on the end of the knife. Okay let's go up here. Let's put some, let's put
some happy little clouds playing up here in the sky and follow angles here. Angles are very important. I'm going to take a little Thalo Blue and Alizaran Crimson. Mix it together and we'll
make a little purplish color. A little blue, Alizaran Crimson. The blue's many, many times
stronger than the crimson. Okay, let's go right up here
and we'll add a little bit of, a little bit of shadow here and there. Don't want a great deal. We'll just drop this in. Go right into the white and
begin just letting all these colors just sort of play together. We'll make some great big,
great big fluffy soft clouds just floating around out here and allow these colors to mix. Don't fight it. Let it happen. Let it happen. There we go. Maybe this big old cloud just
runs right on off the canvas. This is your cloud so you let go wherever you want it to. Now you can paint this
entire painting with a knife if you want to and it's
super, super good practice to learn how to control the knife. Or you can do part with a
knife, part with a brush. Whatever makes you happy. And we just go right over
these purplish colors and some of them will bleed through and make some beautiful things happen. There. Okay let's go right up here. And if you want the color to be darker you continue to rub it. If you want it to be nice
and bright and shiny, leave it alone, get away from it. See just don't keep working it. If you keep working it,
it'll get very, very dull and go away and leave you. It'll pick up all the undercolor so you have to make these big decisions. Okay, maybe, yeah there it is. And I love to do paintings with a knife. Really, really teaches
you how to use a knife. Tell you what I'm going to
take the least little amount of yellow ochre, I mean the
tiniest, tiniest little bit. Add a little bit of color
just to break it up. Now you don't want to get
much of this yellow ochre because it'll touch the
blue and you'll have nice, green sky and we don't want that but a little bit of the gold
color in the sky is very pretty Just adds a little flavor to it. There we go. Small, mighty clouds. And they're very simple to do and a great deal of fun. Okay. And that easy. That easy. We got to a fantastic little sky. It's very, very effective. Don't want to kill all this blue wash that you put in here. Leave some of that showing. So you have areas that are very
thick, areas that are thin. Really makes your painting interesting. Now you can even take a brush and go back over this and really
blend it if you wanted to. I want to leave it a little bit rough. I like paintings that
have texture to them. Okay maybe back in here there's a, maybe there's a happy little hill. I'll just use this same purplish color that was Thalo Blue and Alizarin Crimson. There we go. Now this color will look black to you so if you want to test it, take a little white and put over here. There and then you can
see what color it is otherwise it's just going to look black and that's pretty good color. That's about what I'm looking for. Okay let's go right up here and maybe, maybe there lives a nice little hill just a little soft gentle hill. And I'm really, really pushing
that paint into the canvas. There. There we go. And then you can very gently rub it to make it smooth. You know when we look at knife paintings, a lot of times knife
paintings are so rough that you have to be a long way off to even recognize what it is but it
doesn't have to be that way. You can make very delicate,
soft soothe, smooth paintings just using a knife. Practice with it. Okay, I'm going to take
a little permanent red, a little white and
maybe we'll put at least a little bit of highlight here and there. I don't want a great deal. We'll have our light
coming from the left today. A little permanent red, tiny bit of white. Just enough to put a small
amount of highlight up here. There we go. And just blend it together. Okay. Yeah this is just a little
titanium white right on the bottom cause I want the bottom of my little hills to
be a little bit lighter than the top. Maybe tell you what,
let's play a little here. We'll use the same purplish color and I've added white to it
so it's a little bit lighter in value and maybe over here there's a, maybe there's a hill that's farther away. We'll put it behind there. So it should be a little lighter in value as things get closer to you. In landscape as you get darker. So we'll just drop this one in. That's far, far away and
it's very soft and very quiet back here. And we can bring this one
right down in front of it. Now see this one's darker, so it stands out against the lighter one. And that easy you can make a beautiful little hill back here. Take a little bit of the
light color on the bottom. And this is just Titanium White added right down to the bottom. Blend it all together. There we go. Little more of the permanent red and we'll put a little
highlight right up there so there's little on this hill. We don't want it to be left out. And follow the angles. Always follow these angles. Okay. Now then, let's begin playing with some little grassy areas that
are way back in the back so I'll take some Cad Yellow,
little Yellow Ochre in it and some Sap Green. Looking for quite a dark
green kind of color here, just about like so. Okay let's go right up to the canvas here. And maybe there's some
little background trees that just live right along here. And all I'm doing is just
barely, barely touching the canvas. Make these little trees just
fall right off your knife. I'm going to add a little
Burnt Umber to that color. So it's not the same all over. In darken it down right
here on the bottom. Just barely touching the canvas. There we go. Little more paint. Just let these happen. There. Little bit over in here. But it's unbelievable what you can do just using a big old knife. And try some of these. I think you'll find them
very, very enjoyable and they do good things to your heart and make you happy. Make you happy. Okay, that gives us a little
indication of some trees a little far far away. And some least little
bit of white down here. Begin bringing this over. So I'm just using that same color and I just added a little white to it. Then begin pulling it. There. Now angles are very, very important when you're doing those. Pay close attention to your angles. There we go. Let's go right up here. Okay. As it goes farther away let it get lighter and lighter in value and I want this part
here to look like it's far away and this over on the other side is getting closer to you. I'm going to take a little permanent red, and just very gently add
a little bit of that hair in there. Just to break it up. A little Indian Yellow. It's very transparent. Just sort of work some of these colors back and forth. Make all these pretty
little things happen. Okay now over here. This is closer to you so I'm going to add more Sap Green. I want this side over here to be darker. It's closer so it should be darker but you still need to
follow those basic angles that are very, very important. Okay maybe it just comes
right around my end. Wherever you want it to go. Alright. Okay now it's much much darker here. And sort of blend it together. We don't want it to have
a distinct line there, we just want it to gently,
gently blend together. There. Okay now then, I'm going
to mix up some black and to make that we'll
use some Thalo Green and Alizarin Crimson. Thalo Green, Alizarin Crimson in about equal parts. Just mix them together and this color needs to be
mixed together very well. Normally we don't worry
much about mixing color. Mix this one very good. When you're mixing pick
it completely up off your palette and turn it over. Now then let's go right back up in here and we can start to making some, some big decisions. And maybe, maybe we'll just start touching right in here. There we go. Put some water in here so we need to define where water and land meet. This will be our little
bank when it's done. We need a nice dark color to set it off. And let's take a little light color and just work it right
down into the canvas here. Just pull it down. Just like so. Okay then we'll take
the two and a half inch brush and just grab some of this and pull. Just enough to pull it down. This will end up being some
reflections in the water. And pick up some of that dark green color. All the colors, pick them up cause they all reflect into the water and just pull it straight down. And if this canvas is
dry it won't pull as well as you normally, normally would do with the magic white. We're just looking for some dark color in the water here. Okay now then, we'll take some white and a little Thalo Blue in it. White and a little Thalo Blue. Pull it out very flat and just cut across. Get that little row of
paint right on the edge of the knife. Okay let's go right up here. Now we can begin making
some decisions here where our water is. Just laying a little
bit of this bluish color right over the top of reflections. Don't want to cover them all up though. Don't want to lose them all. Just want to make it look like water without killing everything. There we go. Just sort of work it back and forth. Play with it. Keep these lines basically straight. Water's always looking for a place to be nice and level so
keep these lines straight. And you can put as many of these in your water as you want or as few, either way. Step back and look at your painting every so often. Gives you a whole different view of it. Sometimes when you're painting you stay too close to it
and you really can't see it. Step back. Okay now we can, we want to
firm up these little edges here a little. See that just a touch. This is just the black color,
thalo green, alizarin crimson. There we go. Let me clean my knife and
we can just very lightly bring this color right down on top of it smooth everything out, bring it together. There we go. Allow these colors just
to mix and to blend and all kinds of nice things happen. Don't fight it. The more you rub this with the knife the softer, the more gentle it becomes when all the colors blend
together very smoothly. So you can make paintings that people almost won't believe you've done it with a knife. They'll think you've done it with a very, very soft brush. Okay maybe, tell you
what, maybe go right into some sap green and maybe
there's a little tree that lives right here. This is just sap green. Maybe using a little edge of the knife. Both edges work. There we go. Maybe he's got a friend
that lives right over here. And once again you have to make these big decisions, how many
trees live in your world. Drop them in. I'll take just a tiny
bit of cad yellow now and just put a little
highlight on this tree so he stands out and
sparkles sun shining on him. One big strong happy tree out here. There we go. Little shadow area right behind the tree. Remember where your light is coming from. And just put a little
indication of a shadow. Okay now we get to do something over here on the other side. Make some big decisions. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Tell you what let's just take some more of this black color that we have, it's going so well and maybe, maybe, maybe comes right down here. Maybe there's a little
projection that's... there it is. Comes right out of the water like that. It needs some color underneath that and once again I'll
take this old big brush and you can do this with a knife. I'm doing it with a brush because it's a little bit faster but you can certainly certainly do it using a knife and I'm going to add a
little bit of that water right over the top of that. This is Thalo Blue, Titanium white. And back to our dark color and we can continue this, there it is
right down through there. You knew it all the time, didn't you? There. And I'm just putting the
dark in so light will show. You need the dark in order to show light. A lot of paint here. There we go. Just fill all this up. Okay now we can go right
into some sap green. We can pull in a little
bit of yellow ochre. Just sort of mix these
colors right on your knife. And you can make them as bright or as dull as you want them. If you want them duller because
there's black underneath it just keep rubbing and it will get duller because it'll pick up that
color that's underneath and automatically that happens. If you put yellow on
top of this black color because yellow and black make green, automatically you get a nice green color. Automatically. There. And maybe there's some happy little things that just go right along this edge. Just let your knife
bounce around and play. Okay. Okay maybe, tell you
what, let's have some fun. Maybe there's a big old tree here. Let's use some van dyke brown. I'll put a little burnt umber into it. Pull it out very flat, get
that little roll of paint and maybe, maybe, maybe yup right there. It's a big old tree lives right here. Goes right on off the canvas maybe. Put some tree trunks
right up through the sky. This is where we check
and see if you're brave and go right through your sky with these big brown trunks. Okay tell you what let's give him, let's give him another arm. And you can put as many arms on your tree as you want. It's your tree, your world. Let it go. Maybe, maybe there's
another arm that lives right there. Whatever. And just some indications and we can put a few little limbs here. There might even be a
little one right here. Trees just grow however makes them happy. So that's what they should
do when you're painting them. Makes you grow on your painting. Anyway that makes you happy. It's your tree. Okay we've got a few little
limbs right up through here. There. Now we need a little bit
of highlight on there. I'll use, I'll use a little permanent red, a little burnt umber. I'm going to add a little
yellow ochre into that too. There that'll brighten it up. A little bit of paint
and we said our lights coming from the left so
let's just highlight this tree on the left side and all I'm doing is just touching. Just touch. Canvas will pull off what it wants and give you back what's left. Just a little highlights. And if you want to do
this painting with a brush you can certainly do all this with a little liner
brush or even a fan brush would work very well. Okay now then we need, let's put some leaves on this tree. Go right into some sap green. I'll add some, I'll
add some van dyke brown to my sap green just to dull it down. Very dark and maybe, maybe
we'll just use a knife. We've done so much with a knife that we'll just drop in
some basic little things here and there. And once again you can do all this with a with your brush. It would work just as well. Just to keep it together we'll use a knife and you can put as many leaves as you want in your tree. Just let them go. See there they are. As thick as you want them. As thin as you want them. And we're going to take a little bit of a light color. A little yellow with green and you can drop a
little highlight on here and we I think we've
got a finished painting. The old clock on the wall
says Bob you've got to go. Got to go. So we'll call this painting finished and I've really hope you've enjoyed it. It'll give you a challenge. And until next week happy painting. God bless.
