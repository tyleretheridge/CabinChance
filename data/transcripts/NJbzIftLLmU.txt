- Hi welcome back I've got another little friend here today and this is just a little baby robin and he's just the cutest little thing and he's a little nervous about being here in the studio
with all the lights and he's probably three or four weeks old but isn't he precious? Just a little baby one. I like these little robins cause they have one of the nicest personalities of any birds going. Look at that and probably in about
another three or four weeks he'll be ready to release sent back to the wild. So let's start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to pain along with us. While they're doing that let's come on up here and let me show you what I've got done and I'll set this little fella down. Here you go guy you sit right there. I have my standard old
18 by 24 inch canvas but you use whatever size makes you comfortable. It's covered with liquid white it's all wet and ready to go. So let's go. Thought today we'd just
do a fun little painting Something that's quite easy and and that's you'll enjoy. Take a little bit of the we'll use a little Indian yellow today very little. I just wanna put a least little hint of a yellow glow back here. I think I'll put a little mountain in. So I want just the least little amount of a glow a yellow-ish glow coming
out and behind the mountain. So very very little of this Indian yellow a little goes a long long way cause it'll mix with a liquid white and it'll spread all over
the canvas if you want it to. Really just want a very small amount something about like that . Alright. Now then I'll take a little touch wanna use a little bit
of the phthalo blue. Use a little phthalo blue, I like it That's a very pretty blue very... very shiny blue. Makes you happy to look at it. We'll go right up here at the top make our little criss-cross strokes our little Xs. See there both sides of the brush though see how you use both sides? Good. We'll start at the top work all the way across and then begin working downward in layers and that way automatically it picks up the liquid white and it gets lighter and lighter toward the horizon and that's exactly what we're
looking for in a landscape. Hmmm... ok, maybe down about like that. That's good enough for
what we're gonna do today. Now then, tell you what, now that we have that ole' blue on there put a little more phthalo blue reach right next door get a little bit of the phthalo green. So we have phthalo green and phthalo blue just sorta mix them together on the brush. Phthalo green is another color that's extremely strong be careful with it. Eat up your whole world in a heartbeat. Ok, and just pull from the outside in and I'm gonna make a little water down here I think today. So pull fro the outside in like so a little more of the paint start on the other side do the same thing. Same exact thing wanna leave a little
area open right in there so it looks like the light
shining across the water when we're, finished with the painting. Ok, time to wash the ole' brush that's the fun part of this. That's the fun part. Shake off the excess (rapid thuds) (laughs) and just beat the devil out of it. Oh my goodness. There. Now with a clean brush I'm just gonna go gently across this entire water area. That light area we have in there will remain. Ok. (rapid thuds) knock of any excess paint and where these two come together I'm just going to blend them. Just gonna blend em'. Now be very careful when you're using blue and yellow in the same sky or you'll end up with
a brilliant green sky. Very careful. The only reason we're
getting away with this because the liquid white was on here and we diluted this yellow til it's almost nothing but liquid white up there. (rapid thuds) but it still has a little bit
of yellow-ish flavor in it. There we are. (rapid thuds) Ok. and I beat the brush just to knock excess paint off without going through the
whole cleaning procedure. In layman terms that's called laziness (laughs) cause I don't wanna
have to clean it again. Alright. Tell you what. Let's do... a nice... big strong mountain today. We're gonna use some black a lot of black vandyke brown and let's put some let's put a little bit of the blue in there and we'll use a little a little bit of the phthalo blue you could use phthalo or prussian I think I'll use phthalo
in this particular one. Very dark color Ok then. Cut off our little roll of paint right out on the edge there Now let's go right up in here and make a big decision maybe our mountain lives right about there. Get a little more of the color comes out maybe (mimics zoom sound) whatever whatever. Just put it I'm just gonna put the top
of the mountain right now. Just the top. We're gonna put all kinds of
little doers on this mountain there. We'll stop him right there Now I'm gonna mix up some white.... some white and... we'll just use a little bit of a a little bit of the midnight black make a nice gray color. That's gonna be our highlight color maybe a little bit darker. Just black and white or white and black. Whatever your preference for shadow wanna use black and white and a little touch of
the prussian blue in it not much just enough blue to to flavor it a little but I want the shadow color needles to say to be much darker than the highlighter color but yet not as dark as
the base of the mountain. Ok, let me wipe the ole' knife. Now then let's take, come right up in here and I'm just gonna touch this and sort of let it just bounce so that it breaks but see how it's happening? Just let it sort of break
going in that direction. Right up in here something like so wherever. I'm gonna grab the small knife now. We're gonna use small knife and come right along in here and just put an indication of some shadow back in here. There we are. Maybe I'll put just the
least little touch more blue into my shadow, ooh that's nice. I like that better. like that better. We'll blue it up a little. Stands out better. There. See it makes the indication of a big ole' square-looking
mountain up there. Now then, right in here just using titanium white. I'm just gonna touch just touch just let it, just sort of
bounce and play along there maybe we'll have a bog ole'
glacier here in this one just sort of touch it then gently pull it gently. Ok Now we'll put the least little touch of phthalo blue in there least little touch. So it looks like a little
shadow area here and there. Ok good. Looks like there's a
little ridge right there. Ok and just keep working right on down right on down wherever you want it to go think about a little glacier that lives right here in this mountain. There. Ok. Look at all the snow-cones
you could make with that. Mmm. Alright and then we'll just begin
blending that together very gently. Now over here on the other side we had a little phthalo blue in that one. On this side I'm gonna use straight titanium white There, and just let it go in
the opposite direction but I want this to be brighter more to the white than the other side So you can distinctly tell that there's a light side
and a dark side to this little shadow back here. Look at that. Now then. Just sort of apply that like that. Help me go back to clean
(rapid thuds) and very very dry brush. and grab it and lift it following the angles something like so and that will sort of
bring it all together and that's one of the
nicest, easiest ways of creating the illusion of a little glacier. Let's go back here and have some dark color maybe right there. Maybe there's another
littler doer right in there and maybe since this is our world we
can do anything we want to and maybe there's a little
more snow you can see right in there. Just a little though we don't want a lot. Just a little. There. With our good, clean, dry brush, gently, gently, gently blend that back together. Just blend it back together. (rapid thuds) Now... our highlight colors just basically black and white and a little bit of our shadow color can sneak right back in there. Alright, and we need a a little touch of color right on that little rascal we don't want him left out. Ok and maybe then you have to start
making big decisions here where does all these little peaks and valleys and all those
things live in your world? Maybe that comes right on around I don't know...I don't know yeah I do there it is. See? Just make a decision drop it in but you can make some of the most gorgeous mountains doing this and at home you have unlimited time so you can really do a fantastic job. There's a mean director here she has no sense of humor
if I go over 30 minutes. There we go. So... but at home you can do this just take your time and make beautiful beautiful things. Send me some photographs
of what you're doing. I'd love to see em' in
here once in a while we'd put em' all together and make a little board and show it on t.v. of what people are painting
all over the country. It's unbelievable what people are doing. I get a lot of letters from young friends that are doing some of the
most gorgeous paintings. Absolutely spectacular. There... and make a little shadow just sort of figure out where you think the highlights and the shadows would live. Ok. Maybe this one comes right down like that. It makes the illusion of
a little valley in there. Just like that. Hmmm. Ok. but this is just black and white or white and black or any combination in between a little dark gotta have that dark
so the light will show and I like the contrast here that stark black color against the gray that's what really makes this stand out. There we are and no this is not any particular mountain to be honest I'm just sort of making it up but maybe where you live there is a mountain around
that you'd like to paint and this will show you how to do it. Just sorta look at the mountain that's in your area and using these basic principles you can paint your own mountain. Any ole' way that you want to. Maybe a little highlight out there. In here and there and there and here a little bit of the little bit of the shadow colors will show. I don't wanna lose that nice darkness I'm not gone put a bunch
of shadows in there. There we are maybe this little shadow
right there though and a little highlight right above it then maybe just another little shadow that comes right down like that. Isn't is fantastic what you can do with a big ole' puttyknife-looking thing and a little practice and you can do this. You can do anything that
you believe you can do and I know you can do this so certainly you know it. There. There we are. Hmm. Wasn't that a cute little robin on the beginning of the show? I like it, little rascal. Robins have some of the nicest personalitites of any of the birds I've met and I've raised a lot of little birds and, they may be my favorite. (rapid thuds) There's a lot of exotic birds
around that you can look at but sometimes the little
common birds that we, we see everyday and we take for granted can be the most beautiful. If you just take the
time to get to know em' and one of the best ways,
put a feeder out in your yard and watch, watch (rapid thuds) how many little critters show up. I just beat some of that
paint off the brush there. Little bit over in here. I remember just recently my partner is wanting a net put a bird feeder out in the net call me and she says, "I
don't think the birds like me "there's no birds around" Told her just wait a day or two. (rapid thuds) Or then probably, probably a week she called back and she said "I can't keep enough food in the house to keep em' all going" and just a matter of maybe a week they had found her feeder and well she was in business I tell ya she had more
birds running around and now we've got Walt interested in it and he's out with his video camera they've become his special little critters now. So we have another convert. Ok. Enough yak-yaking let me get off my soapbox
about the little birds but that's a nice way of making a (rapid thuds) a very effective little mountain and you change it to match a mountain that you want to have in your painting. We just wanna show you how to make one. Alright, let's take black we'll use some of this prussian blue prussian blue shoot I'm gone grab some
of this phthalo green. There we are maybe a little midnight brown There we are, maybe a
little alizarin crimson I like it, that gives it a nice flavor. Ok. Now then, we can clean off this old knife. Let's find us a fan brush. There we are. Maybe in our world back here at the base of this mountain lives some nice little trees. Little friendly trees. There. Now we're wanna save a little mist between the trees and the mountain, otherwise the trees will just sort of dissapear right into the mountain color. So we wanna save a little
misty area in there. It's very important very valuable. It's like a good friend take care of it. Take care of it. There. Ok, and maybe maybe they have some trees
living all the way back somewhere here wherever you what them to go. Wherever and we'll take one off over here something like that just let em' grow and grow but all we're doing is
sort of tapping downward. Just give it a a little downward tap. Maybe I'll have some big trees over there I suppose that sounds like a good idea. So... if you decide you gone
have big trees over here then you don't have to paint that area of course if you change your mind then you gotta go back and put em' in but that's alright. Just tapping the base of this with a two inch brush firmly to help create that illusion of mist then I'm gonna lift upward a little bit and anything you don't like down here you can just blend it in no biggie why not a big mountain My gosh. (rapid thuds) I like them ole' big mountains. Tell ya what tell ya what take a little of that same color save a little misty area and maybe we said we was gonna have some water pull straight down with the same color same exact color. There we go (happily mimics scraping sound) just pull it down take another brush that doesn't
have so much paint on it now go gently across and that quick we have instant reflections. Instant relfection. You can take a fan brush with a little bit of light color white whatever lift upward and it'll look like little... little tree trunks from far away. Or you can do it like this and lift upward and see it'll make another plane there looks like a little little ridge or something there. Creates another plane in your painting and the more planes that
you have in your painting usually the more depth and
distance you'll have in it. That's a sneaky little way
though of getting an extra plane without working for it Well, at least not working much maybe, maybe we're doing a little bit. To me painting is not work just fun. Take a little bit of that same dark color I want a little peninsula right here just drop it in and underneath it pull down and once again we have
a little reflection. That's all there is to it. Take that same color go into a little bit of the
ked yellow and yellow ochre Indian yellow and it'll make a nice green. We can put some highlights
right there on that there there See there? There we go just however many you want and then it comes back
to about right there. Let's take the little dark sienna a little white, mix it together make it a brown-ish color and let's go back in here and firmly lay in the indictation of a little bit of land that lives way back here. I'm rubbing it quite
firmly into the canvas cause I don't want the color
to stand out too bright. Just enough so you can
see there's a little little dirt back there. There we are. There we are, there we are. There it goes and then we can take a little
touch of the liquid white I wanna add a little a little touch of phthalo
blue to it not much just to dull it down a little and here and there, and there and here you can put the indication of a little little water line. There. Don't want too much. Alright. Ok we gotta start making
some big ole' decisions here Maybe in our world, maybe in our world there is...there is maybe there's another little peninsula or bigger peninsula comes right down something like... there. Wherever. You decide. and underneath it once again, we need a reflection. If you ever do a painting
and it looks like the land up here is floating in the air chances are your forgot the relfections and it'll give the indication that it's floating above the water instead of in the water. You need, some kind of little... little reflection to set the... the land down into the water. Ok. There. I'm just wiping off any
excess paint that's on there. Little bit of the... ked yellow yellow ocre Indian yellow once in a while a little
touch of the bright red not too much though it'll eat up your whole world and maybe back here we'll put a little highlight some happy little things that
are growing right out here. See, you need that dark where this won't show. Absolutely won't show cause light against
light gives you nothing or dark against dark gives you absolutely nothing There we go. Pull it down. Once again back to the dark sienna. Just dark sienna with
a little white in it. Just put the indication here some little somethin' little bit of the liquid white. There we go. Now then, let's build us a... let's build us a happy little tree or two or three or four or however many. There he is, big ole' tree lives right there just from side to side like so. See how that stands out against that little bit
of yellow back there? We don't care what it
looks like on the bottom cause we'll separate that later. There is another one. There. See down here you can just
do anything that you wanna do doesn't matter and... oh there's one. You decide how many
trees live in your world. Alright. Just wanna darken that
ole' one real good there. Ok. Maybe...maybe maybe, maybe you're right. there's another one. There. Just back and forth there isn't that a nice way though to make some very effective little evergreens? Tell you what, let's put a let's put one or two on the other side we don't want it left out there it is (mimics zoon sound) there it comes. Once again watch that yellow that dark dark color against that yellow that's why it's in there just for the contrast. Maybe this one here it's got a little tilt on him there. There we are. Let's go back to our brush
that has the dark color in it ole' two inch brush and maybe this comes right down (mimics trekking sound) right on down there we are this swings back up (laughs quietly) Did you ever know you had so much power that you could do things like that? Lake sort of looks like a... a little heart back here or valentine painting. In this area we can just paint in it doesn't much matter. Doesn't much matter. There we go put this in with an ole' shoe I guess if you wanted to. Yeah, we go back into our yellows yellow ocre Indian yeah, little ked yellow and begin picking out the little highlights here the little grass areas
that lay right along. If you work with us a little
bit you'd be surprised at the effects you can make with a big ole' two inch brush. There. Maybe here and there there's a little bush just sort of hangs our over here. There it is but pay attention to
the lay of the land here you don't wanna just
throw these in at random. The lay of the land is very very important very important it'll make or break your painting. There. Over here on the other side can't leave him out put a few little things coming right down like that right on down. Ok. Something like so. Alright. Tell you what let's do, we've got a just a second left here so with that I'ma put just the indication
of a trunk here and there. There we go. Let's take a fan brush
with a little bit of green on it put some highlight on these trees. We about have a finished
painting once we've done that. Think about where the lights coming from our mountain indicates
it's coming from the right so that's where we want
emphasis on the trees too. There we are. Little highlight on there and on this one don't want much on that
one cause it's behind. See? and this one's in the foreground (chuckles lightly) you have to make those decisions. A little on this one and we'll call this
whole painting finished. Hope you've enjoyed this one. It'll certainly teach you how to use the tools and I think you'll find
it very very rewarding. From all of us we'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless my friend. (smooth easy listening music)
