happy welcome back certainly glad you could join me cause today's a special day today I have a couple of guests that I want to introduce you to these are two little baby robins and there's some of the cutest little rascals Hey Oh what you gonna do you don't believe my finger no we've named these two little robins after two of our camera people here so I'll introduce you this is Cathy because he talks all the time and this is Richard and we named him Richard because his hair is coming out so these are special little friends and they're just as cute as they can be they're just a couple of weeks old and they are hungry they're always hungry they're yeah you are so cute so I tell you what let's start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that almost like these little guys down and I'll be right with you here okay we're sitting right there okay today I have the good old standard 18 by 24 inch canvas but we've done something a little bit different so if we come right up here let me show you now then I've painted all of this with black gesso and I've allowed that black gesso to completely dry and then on top of that I've covered it with a transparent color and I made this color from a mixture of Prussian blue Van Dyck Brown and sap green and I put the Van Dyck Brown there only to dull the color and I've left this area open and then we've covered that with liquid white and that's good and whipped so and all you do here is take this transparent color and just really worked it in all we're looking for is a nice and even coat that may very well be the hardest part of this whole painting it's just to get that on there so now that in here with the same color we want to begin putting in some basic little shapes that will indicate little leaves and stuff later on so we take that same color and then just begin tapping in to allow it to to mix with a liquid white see there and already it begins giving you some very basic little shapes big trees that are hanging over here and later on we'll really enjoy that we'll just have a good time we'll come back we put highlights so we'll make big branches and leaves all kinds of little things all we're looking for now it's just very very basic shapes just like so as black gesso is fantastic it does so many wonderful things it may be one of the neatest things that I've ever invented I don't know why it wasn't done a long time ago it's the same as white gesso but it's just dark okay already we have a basic shape in okay now then let's take another two inch brush it would make us a happy little sky in this painting and for that I'm going to add a small amount of phthalo blue and tap the bristles firmly tap them that assures a nice even distribution of color all the way through the bristles now very lightly very lightly just making little crisscross strokes we'll just put in a happy little sky back here between those tree branches there and just let it get lighter and lighter and lighter down toward the horizon shoot you might even go back in here and add the least little touch of alizarin crimson to your brush just to change the flavor a little bit down in here we'll bring it right on down there now I'm going to wash the brush and we wash our brush with odorless thinner shake off the excess it just beat the devil out of it yeah take a little titanium white I want a bright spot right in here there we go and blend upward come down with dark color upwards with light color and it makes a beautiful little lavender area right in there that's easy okay now maybe maybe back here in our world maybe there's an indication of just a happy little cloud or to this floating around so we just take titanium white on the fan brush and decide where you think maybe a little cloud lives and just we just want some little indication of some floaters that are we off in the distance we're not going to see much of this so don't worry about it too much maybe there's another one wherever you want to just sort of make a big decision and drop them in take a 2 inch brush gently blend the base of it love it just fluff it up and blend it out and that easy we get some happy little clouds back here in the background now then maybe to me this is sort of like looking through a big group of trees and maybe there's a scene back there so for them I'm going to take some Van Dyke Brown little Van Dyke Brown get a little black just mix them on the brush you're a little touch of the crimson be right back right back a little white they're brown black little crimson and white load a lot of color in the brush maybe you can see the indication of some nice little little mountains that live we back here in the distance there just take the corner of the fan brush and lay in a very basic little shape and let it blend downward getting lighter and lighter as it works down very little color on the canvas so let's see it's very simple to change and add shapes like in any way you want any way you want them and we take a 2 inch brush grab that and pull just put it and your brushstrokes can create the illusion of highlights and shadows back here in your mountain that easy that easy and then we'll go back into just a touch of the day little blue little touch little touch maybe I'll grab the least little touch of the lizard crimson okay now maybe there's a little lake under this mountain far away pull straight down just make a decision where you think your little lake should live pull straight down like so and then very lightly go across they're easy just go right across maybe maybe we'll take a little black little SAP green be right back a little touch of the white into it now then maybe back in here just touch give a little upward push maybe there's just an indication of some little trees that go right to base of this mountain far far away back here in the distance but don't don't get too much detail in here or it'll ruin that illusion of distance and then little touch you the liquid white for the knife put the least little touch of the bright red in it just to warm it up a little leaves little touch so you don't don't want to set it on fire without flat cut across and then we'll go right up in here just put the indication of a little water line back here just a little lighter you in between these darks make everything Sparkle just come alive that's something very nice very easy and it's fun and we get we get letters every day from people who have they have discovered what it is to paint and how much fun it can be I get letters from people that tell me that they had retired maybe from their job and thought they wasn't going to have anything to do and just by accident they happen to find the show and they decided to try it and son of a gun they got hooked they got hooked and opened a whole new world to him just absolutely a whole new world and you can do that too if you haven't tried this you should give it a try okay I've mixed some suppression blue some SAP green a little brown a touch of alizarin crimson to make a very dark color now then we just use the old fan brush what the heck let's see when we did this black gesso we put the original black gesso we had a basic idea of always going to do but that's all just a basic idea so now we can begin adding all these little details this is where you have to make decisions maybe there's some little evergreens that live right here maybe like maybe sort of over hill and you just see in the tops up I don't know just make a decision and drop it in that's what's so fantastic about this this style of painting there there are no accidents there are no mistakes just work with it then you have fun painting painting should make you happy it doesn't make you happy then you're doing the wrong thing there anything in your life to do should make you happy should bring joy to you then you're doing the right thing shoot is enough unhappy stuff in the old world enjoy what you doing let's take I got the old dirty brush here we take a little caddy I'll reach over here get some yellow ochre a little Indian yellow we just want to mix them together on the brush a little touch a SAP green there now just tap color in there now we have to start making some big decisions where does our land live here how does it flow this is where the lay of the land is created now we take this brush with color and all you have to do is just touch the canvas just sort of tap it just happen see how easy that is just tap but the lay of the land now becomes very important and darker darker darker back up in here in the shadows and saying that instantly pushes that area right back into the distance there we go now there's all different planes in your world different angles shapes think about them don't just hit it random think about how how the land flows in your world look at there see there's a whole nother another bluer there there we go darker darker darker in here there's shadows cuz these trees are going to create big shadows bagels shatter some aren't those little robins cute they are some of the nicest little son of against I think maybe Robinson and Moll convert seem to have the best personality of all the birds that I've worked with small birds they are just absolutely super little characters there we go a lot of times in Etna and that's my partner and at night go around it we look at little birds and stuff and we've even been known to go out in a canoe and find find a little bird nest and look at it and then take pictures of it as we as we watch it over a period of time that's a lot of fun and probably in your area you've got some happy little birds too without disturbing you can observe them and see some of God's greatest creations in just these little creatures there we go and we all need to we all need to take care of these little rascals treat them nice ok we just keep going on and on here as far as you home maybe you can grade them a little rascals in the background they think it's time to be fed Perce little baby birds are like little little people children they think they need to be fed every few minutes there we go Jane but just tapping so you look at all the different layers that are created in this painting already in painting depths created by planes so we have several here there is one there is one there's another one and right on up that's what creates that illusion of depth now I'm going to start letting this get darker and darker as we work back here into the shadows there we are darker and darker just tapping less and less color on the brush and the more you tap this the darker it'll become because I have to color this on the canvas will bleed through it'll come through the more you tap because you mix these colors together there should we just let's just do all this little grassy area that looks like such a nice place it's when in places where he like to take off your shoes and just sort of run barefooted through there makes you toes feel funny there I like to feel fresh grass on my little foots somebody's going to argue until you get big foots there we go okay see there and by this getting darker it looks closer to you in the landscape and you know this already I know the landscape things get darker and darker as they get closer to you and that creates that illusion of distance also there looks like a little meadow there where just layer after layer but start in the area this father's two way and work forward always work in layers always work in layers okay now then now then let's have some fun maybe we use the old liner brush today doesn't matter we'll take a little - let me grab a little more paint thinner here what take some fan deck ground and load this brush full of color there's a little white in there - vendek Brown I reach down here be right back a little more white I'll get a little more thinner this has to be very thin to make it flow in this canvas and load a lot of paint turn the bristles turn its most important it brings it back to a nice sharp point now then maybe we have a big tree it lives right in here there you just let him run right on off there see there and you could do this with a fan brush or or whatever it doesn't matter finer brush was just laying there so it was easiest to use there and maybe over here you can make out a few little things if you have trouble making your paint flow add more paint thinner because if it's thin it will flow on here there because there's paint that we use is extremely thick it's very thick very dry if you have a thin ollie paint you're going to become a mud mixer and then you're going to be very upset with me and we don't want that to happen be sure your paints very very dry and firm and a lot of times when you go to the art store they'll tell you it doesn't matter but in this particular technique it really does matter there we are it's like it's like odorless thinner have people write me all the time and so they went to the hardware store and they bought some odorless thinner in the men swore to him I was oldest and they got home and open the can and they can't even stay in the same house with it I'd recommend when you buy odorless thinner that you open the can in the store and have a sniff you'll know instantly whether it's odorless or not now then let's put some beautiful little leaves and stuff out here I won't dip the brush into a small amount of the liquid white first and we dipped it in there only to thin it only to thin it because remember our golden rule a thin paint will stick to a thick paint be right back get a little green there we are with this darkened down a little bit now tap the bristles like so see the angle that's most important to load it screw it up here now maybe there's some big trees hanging over here you have to make a decision where they live let's start over here just use the corner of the 1 inch brush or the 2 inch brush it didn't make any difference and begin laying in all kinds of little things but just the corner of the brush whichever brush you use maybe we'll do one on one side with a one-inch brush and the other side with the two it's just to show you the effects think about clumps in here groupings don't just throw these on at random think about the individual leaf and limbs shapes there we are I know sometimes on the television screen it looks like you're just thrown in helter-skelter but look at look at shapes think about the limbs the branches inside of the tree that hold all these little rascals up think like a tree there because if you're an artist you know you can do things like yet people expect you to be different it's alright so alright first time I told my mother I was trying to think like a tree she sort of looked at me a little strange but I was always sort of strange anyway she didn't think too much of it she still thinks I'm strange today there we are but artists take that artists license you can do anything at least on this canvas anything that you want to do maybe down in here we'll get into some little maybe there's a little trees that live all down in here say just think about little individual song give them names just like I do with the Robins just give them names make friends with them shoot maybe there's another one lives here and each paintings going to be unique and different I really suggest that when you do your own painting don't just try to copy I want to give you a technique to use and then turn you loose on the world too because once you know the technique then you can do anything you can literally do anything all you have to do is create a vision in your mind and believe that you can do it because we can do anything in this life that we believe we can do if you believe strong enough anything is possible anything is possible there and you believe in yourself because you're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be and you're special you're very special there we are see the little blue seas they just jump right in there and you can put as many or as few as you want in your world didn't matter I promised I'd do the other side with the large brush just so you could see it so we'll just take a large brush I just got a dirty one here and we loaded exactly the same way a yellow ocher little Indian yellow there just tap those bristles oi it's very important you can see how it's pushing up a little little roll of paint right there you can see it see it right here push into that that's what loads of tips of those bristles now then maybe in this big old tree here we'll just have easily just hang right over here a lot of people will find that this big brush works much easier in the effects are much nicer than the little brush it's sort of an individual thing practice it both ways decide which one you like and then that's the right way for you there whatever works is exactly right but either way you do it you still need to think about shape and form and the individual little creatures branches and all that that's inside of this tree you know I always say make a place for the little birds to sit that's a good way of remembering think about these little characters so you need a place to put their foot so just leave little areas where they can fly in and get in there get to all the goodies there we are okay and as many anis view you on there are no rules here see there one after the other don't get the big hurry don't get in a big hurry just take your time and enjoy just enjoy it's important that you are happy with what you're doing very important life's too short to be miserable there we are now then maybe a little more of that yellow ochre and let's see the same thing over here you can create a happy little Bush it's lives right here it just sort of peeks out over the lake maybe back in here there's an a thought see just think about just think about wherever you want as many or as few there we go okay hey just over and over in classes we teach classes all those are the country in the classes this may be the thing that people enjoy the most because it it works even if they've never painted before people who come to class on the first date go home with a painting like this believe that or not now let me show you something up you're bringing camera right back up here see these dark areas in here these are very very important these dark areas create distance and depth there's deep shadows in there it's almost a natural tendency to want to kill those come over to the other side over here watch right look in here you see these areas that's what creates the depth and this particular clump bushes right here it's very important and they're up here and sometimes when you start painting it it starts to feel good it works well and you get carried away and you kill all those dark areas and then you'll stand back and you look at your painting and you say my painting looks flat looks dead there's no life in it what's wrong check to make sure you haven't killed all these dark areas and see if that doesn't work tell you what let's have some fun today I'm gonna get out we'll use the old number three fan brush I'm going to dip it into a little little bit of liquid clear just to make a nice thin paint really take some liquid clear here be right back get a little dark color this is a thinner color all right dark one side and then light on the other so we have a dark side and then a light side I think there's a difference in the brush sort of shiny because it clears very shiny dark light okay maybe in here maybe there's some nice big bushes as you grow up in here maybe they're like big cattails or something or I don't know take the brush and touch and begin pulling down and as you pull down begin turning it you can make them fatter skinnier see there now this can also be used to do some beautiful things in florals I'm not really a floral painter but you can certainly use this technique to do some beautiful beautiful effects we just put look at there see how they turn but as many or as few as you want in here let some of them overlap there we go wherever you want some little short guys in here it's something a little bigger but one thing it will help is reload the brush between each and every one reload the brush may be over in here and you can vary your colors where are your colors just make all kinds of things there's one right across through there some got to make those little boys if you don't make a little noise they just don't work over and over and this creates a whole different plane it makes more depth in your painting it's like you're standing behind these looking we out over a last little pond little meadow all kinds of things are happening there give us a try I really think you're going to enjoy tell you what let's take the old line of birth little paint thinner let's sign this one we'll call it finished I really hope you've enjoyed it it's sort of different it'll give you something to work with and bring you many hours of pleasure and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless I look forward to seeing you again you you
