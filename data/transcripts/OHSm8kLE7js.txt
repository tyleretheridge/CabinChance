- Well, here we are again, ready to go. So today, I think I'll do a painting that's a little bit different. Maybe, we'll try to do
a little covered bridge. I've been spending a
lot of time in Indiana the last few months and
we've produced a series here in Indiana, so let's
do a little covered bridge. Indiana has a lot of covered
bridges, so we'll start with a little bit of alizarin
crimson and Prussian blue. Just mix 'em on the brush here. And, let's just go right
up in here and do like so, just put in a little background color. There we are. I'm not worried about
shapes or anything here, I'm just applying some background color. Something like so. This is just a little Prussian
blue and alizarin crimson, now the Prussian blue is
many, many times stronger than the alizarin crimson, so
use very little of the blue. Okay, we'll wash the brush, and I want to put some little
trees that are far back in the background. Okay, let's start with a one inch brush and let's just go right
into some cad yellow, some yellow ochre, just mix 'em up here a little bit, and a little
tiny bit of permanent red. Maybe we'll have a little fall scene here with a lot of colors in it. Okay, now let's just go back in here and just begin picking out
some basic little shapes, just barely touching and pulling down. We'll add a tiny bit of sap green to that, there's still a little bit
of green left back here. Okay yeah, oh yeah, that's much better, that stands out better. Then we just lay in some
little basic shapes, far, far back. We're not looking for detail. That'll come later. And, sort of vary your colors, so they stand out a little bit. Don't kill all the little
purplish color that you have here. You wanna retain some of that. Just let it work down. A little more green
there, sap green, there. Should be something like so. Distant, distant background. And just, as I say, vary
the colors a little bit, so they stand out, there, nice yellow. Okay, now we'll take the large brush and very gently, I'm
just gonna lift upward. Just to soften this, and
make it look further away. There we go, and that'll give
us a quick, little background. Now, let's take the large
brush and we'll go right into some sap green, a little
bit of alizarin crimson, and some Van Dyke brown. Just mix 'em on the brush. We're lookin' for a pretty dark color here and we can begin dropping
in some basic shapes. Really push that brush into
the canvas, make it bend. Okay, maybe way up in here. There we are, all kinds of
beautiful little shapes, just let 'em fall off your brush. That's alizarin crimson,
sap green, and a little bit of Van Dyke brown, maybe
there's a nice tree here, that just sorta hangs over. All background, so
we're really not worried about detail at this point. There we go. And that gives us some nice,
basic background shapes. Okay. A little bit more, right over in here. All righty, now we can start playing with a little bit of detail. Take a little Van Dyke brown,
a tiny bit of umber in it, and we'll just put a happy,
little tree trunk, right here. And, like so. And there, give him a
little arm, out here. And most of this is gonna disappear, we're really not worried
too much about it. Some of it will show through the leaves, when we put 'em on. And, we'll take a little bit
of white, and add the same color to it, and we'll
make this little highlight. That's just white, with a little
bit of brown, a little bit of umber in it. Just put some little
indications, here and there. Maybe there's a few more little
things that live back here. Just indications. Maybe over here is a nice little tree. Give him a little trunk, too. Don't want him to be left out. There we go. Okay, now we can go in here and we'll take a little bit of cad yellow, sap green, and we can begin laying some highlights on these. Touch, push the brush
upward to make it bend a little bit. The brush needs to bend. Very quiet, don't want
it to get too bright yet. We'll brighten it up in the foreground. Okay, drop a few little
things down in here. A little bit of yellow ochre,
just so that one stands out. Here I'm using the brush
sideways and making it bend upward, just to create all these nice little grassy things. And, we do 'em in layers,
starting in the back and working forward. Okay, let's move over to the other side of the canvas here. And, we can begin putting some leaves on some of these little trees and bushes. Okay, there's one right there. Using the brush sideways again, to create little grassy areas. And, let's go up here
to this old, big tree, put some beautiful little leaves on him. There we are. Let's just drop 'em in. It's your creation. I added a tiny bit of paint
thinner to my brush there, just to thin the paint
down, so it'll stick easier. Ooh, a lot of nice foliage here. Give you some good practice. Let's go right in here
and drop in a few more little bushes and stuff, to stand out. There he is. Okay now, maybe back
here, in the background, maybe there's a little road. Maybe it just goes right
around the corner back here, and it just comes right out like this. Straight Van Dyke brown to start with, gotta put the dark on,
so the light will show. Okay now, we can take
some brown and white. I wanna put a touch of blue into it, just a touch, just a touch. And then, lay a little
bit of highlight on here. An old road, it goes through the woods. Now, with a little, tiny bit
more of the yellow and green, I wanna set that road
down into the painting. Let some of the bushes
come up over the road. That helps create the
illusion of distance, like it's going back around the corner. We don't know where
it's going, don't care. Just let it go. All righty, now, I'm
gonna go back into some good, dark color here, sap
green and Van Dyke brown. Maybe this time, we'll
even add a little bit of Prussian blue to it,
to really darken it up. And work right in here, throw
some very, very dark color, mostly green, though, very dark. And, some on this side. So, that's Van Dyke brown,
sap green, a tiny, little bit of Prussian blue. You want this to be very, very dark. Okay, I think it's time we started playing a little bit with the bridge. This is where the fun starts. And, probably one of
the easiest ways for you to learn how to do these
fantastic little buildings and bridges and stuff. Let's go in here, and very
gently, let's just scrape out a basic shape, and maybe we're looking at a covered bridge, and we're
looking right through it, so we can see the road behind it. So, let's go right up in
here, and just take and lay in a very basic shape. And, I know this is gonna,
this is gonna drive you up the wall, when you start scraping out all your beautiful painting. And, I don't wanna kill
all this, I wanna be able to see it through the bridge. So, I just take that, and
try to save quite a bit of it here. I wanna be able to see through it. So, just scrape out your basic shape. Like so, this gets rid of
some of the loose, thin paint and makes the next layer
of paint stick much easier. This will help you. It's also a nice way to sorta
lay out your perspective, a little bit. Okay, now we can go right
into some Van Dyke brown, and let's go right up
here and begin building our little covered bridge. There we go. You know, just recently I
found out, while I was here in Indiana, why they
built covered bridges. I always thought it was a
place you could go and get out of the rain or something. And, the reason they
covered these bridges was to protect the structure,
so the weather wouldn't get to it. It really wasn't the reason
I thought it was, at all. So, I learned something. Okay, here I'm gonna just lift
upward with a little brown. All I'm gonna do is, fill
all this in with the brown. And then, we can begin working on detail. Just fill-in the entire thing with nothing but Van Dyke brown. There we go, make us a nice edge, right down like that. Firm that edge up. And this old bridge, he's had a hard life. He's not in the best of repair. Give him a side over here, and one here. There we go. Now, we can just fill all this in. That's the beauty of usin' a big knife, you can just drop things
right in, no problem. Okay, now we have to do
this bridge in stages. And, we do the part
that's farthest away first and come forward. So, I wanna be able to
see through this bridge, so we'll do the back of it
first, and then come forward. Down here, we'll just fill all that in. Just fill it in. A lot of brown. There we go. A lot of brown paint. There, I know you're
sitting at home sayin', "Boy, he's messed up this time." And, you may be right. Let's just see what happens here. So, in the background, we
want very, very little light back here, not a great
deals gonna show, back here. Just some little indications. Don't overdo, just some
very faint indications. So, when we put the
front of the bridge on, it'll show better. Okay now, just put a
little, tiny highlight here, this is just a little brown and white, just a little. A little light playing
around across there. Don't want too much, just a little. Now, we can start working
on the front of the bridge. And, take some brown, some Van Dyke brown, and some umber and white. Make this look like old wood. Don't over-mix your paint,
leave it sorta marbly here. So, that way, all these colors will happen right here in your bridge. Okay, now let's just take
the small edge of the knife and begin making some boards. Now maybe, maybe you
can just scratch a line, right through here, if it'll help you a little
bit to give you an idea of where you want the
front of the bridge to be. And, that'll be our stopping point. So, we take the small edge of the knife, and just start making some boards. This one's made out of old slab boards, just barely touching, pulling down. There we are. And, leave some space in between 'em. As I say, these old bridges, some of 'em are in bad repair, they've
really been beat to death. Just wanna make it look like
old boards hangin' here. There we go, now then. Let it come all the way down here. Just put you some boards in. Boy, that bridge has
really had a rough life. Okay, and we let these
come all the way down. Like so, there we go. Now don't, don't cover up all the dark, 'cause back in here we
wanna give the impression that we can see in and over. Maybe, a little bit there. Angles are very, very important here. You wanna make it look like we can see through this bridge. Keep this very dark, 'cause
it's all in shadow here. It's all in shadow. Just come right on down like so. Put all these old nice
wood things in here. Maybe, there's a little beam right here, that we can see. It comes right across. Okay, and now we can straighten up this edge a little, give
him a little more distance, a little more depth in the bridge. There we are. This is just straight Van Dyke brown. Now, if you wanted to, you can take little bit of brown and
create some boards here. I've just got a little tiny
bit of brown on the knife and just touching, just
to create the illusion of wooden planks. Look at that. Did you ever think that
an old covered bridge would be this easy to make? And just, let a little of it run down. I think so. Now then, I wanna leave
this area right in here very, very dark, to make it
look like there's a recessed area and water down there. I might even take and add
a little bit of brown, right down here at the bottom. Really, really very dark. Very, very dark. And, we can just fill
the rest of the canvas up here with a little bit
of sap green, like so. And, and, and you can. Now, we'll come right along here and put a little bit of
highlight on the road. Just a little. Okay, now with a, let's
take the little liner brush and we'll take a little paint
thinner and mix a little bit of this brown, till it's just
like water, very, very thin. And maybe, maybe there's
some little cattails that live right here. So, we'll just put in some
little stems, like so. And then, put the little cattail on there. And, we just push real
hard with the brush, bloop, and drop 'em in. See how easy that is? Just to give some little indications, make it look like there's water here, without actually seeing any. There we go, just a
few little indications. That's a nice one, bloop,
put a little fuzzy thing up on him. Okay now, let's take the old fan brush, I'm gonna add a little of the thinner, to the fan brush to make this paint a little bit thinner, and
load up some cad yellow, yellow ochre, and we'll
put some sap green into it. There we are. And now, we can begin deciding
where everything's at. And maybe, there's a little
grassy areas right here, that could just come right
down, right out in the front, just like so. This old bridge isn't
used too much any more, so the grass is beginning
to take the road back. Nature has a way of reclaiming things. There we are. Okay now, let's go over
here and do basically the same thing, put in
a few little highlights. Leave this dark area, it'll
make it look like water back in there, or like
there's a recessed area where water could be. This is where you sorta
clean up all the edges and bring it together. There. Now. And, no covered bridge
painting would be complete, unless we had a big tree in it. So, let's put a big old tree in it. Start with Van Dyke brown and maybe the big tree lives right about here, big tree, a lot of brown. And, we can just drop him right in. It's your world, so you put a tree where you want him. And, when you're doing this at home, don't worry about copying exactly what I'm doing here. These are only guides. They're only to give you ideas and to stir your imagination and to show you how to
make the equipment work. These are only guides. 'Cause everyone sees nature differently. Put your dreams on canvas. Okay, let's give him a happy little limb right out here. There he goes. And maybe, maybe, who knows? Maybe there's a big limb and there it is. It just comes right out and sorta shadows the bridge. Keeps it nice and cool in the summer. Just recently I had the pleasure of doin' some demonstrations at a Covered Bridge
Festival, here in Indiana. And, I met some of the most super people, fantastic people. There we go, just some limbs. Now then, we can use a
little brown and white, and I'm gonna put a little
touch of permanent red in it, just to brighten
up a tiny, little bit. And, we'll come right in here
and just put some highlights, right on this big tree,
there just let it go, like so. Now next week, if you're gonna paint along with us, we'll be doin' a white canvas. So, have your easel set
up, a big, old glass of tea right there, beside you. I'm an iced tea freak, I
was raised in the south, and everybody there likes iced tea. One habit I never got over,
when I moved to Alaska. While we got this brown goin' here, I'm gonna put a couple
little, maybe there's a little fence, right here. There, we'll put a little post there. Maybe there's another one right there. A little fence, you know. Sometimes maybe, back in
the horse and buggy day, maybe they'd had a
little too much to drink and they didn't go
through here too straight. So, this was sort of, to
guide 'em through, maybe. There. Maybe there's, I'm gonna
put one more post out here with nothing on it. This one's already lost
all of it's boards. Then we'll add a tiny,
little bit of highlight here, to make these posts look right. There we go, just drop it on. Isn't that fantastic? Okay now, let's go up
here and put some leaves on this tree. We'll just use the old big
brush, and I'll just use some sap green and Van Dyke brown. And first, we'll put the
dark in, just to give us some indications. Just some indications,
and then we'll come back and lay some highlights on all these. There we go. And maybe, there's a
few leaves right there. Where ever you think they should be. Now, we'll use a little bit of cad yellow, with the least, little
amount of sap green. And, I want this bright
enough so it stands out. Now, we can go back and lay
some highlights right on here, there, just let 'em fall off your brush, just here and there. Oh, look at that. It sorta brings the painting together. The old covered bridge is standin' there and the trees just hanging over. Maybe you're doing this at home, let your imagination go, think of a million little
scenes that you can make out of this basic idea. Okay, now we can sorta clean-up the bottom and we're on the verge of havin' a finished painting here. Put a little grass around the bottom of this tree, just to
cover-up his little foots, big foots, like so. And, I think we're about
ready to sign this one. So, I'll take a little
bit of the thin oil, a little permanent red. And there we are. And, we'll just drop a happy
little signature in here. And, we hope you've enjoyed this painting half as much as we have. It's really a pleasure being here with you and showing you some of
these fantastic ideas. And we hope we bring a little
happiness into your life and give you some ideas. And you too, will drag
out your almighty brush and paint along with us. So, from all of us here,
we'd like to wish you, happy painting. God bless, see you next week. (jazz quartet music)
