(pleasant music) - Well here we are again. And if you were with us last week, I promised you a crazy one. And today you're gonna get it. I think you're going to enjoy this. Let's look at the canvas
for just a second. I have a canvas here that's painted half white and half black. The bottom half, about 11 inches up, is painted with a flat black
acrylic and allowed to dry. The top is just plain. On the bottom I've taken and made one circle of
thalo green in the center, covered the rest of it with a thalo blue. The top is covered with
magic white as usual. So, let's do a fantastic painting here. I'm going to start out
with a little bit of, this is a little bit of white
and brown, a touch of yellow. We're gonna make a seascape today. We're gonna make a violent seascape. I will just make a little circle
right up in here, like so. There we go. Now, to that, I'm gonna
add just a touch of brown, and a little bit of blue. And we'll make another little
circle right around it. There we go. And we'll just let that
work all the way around. And right down in here I'm gonna pick up a little bit of the blue
and work that right in. Just a little bit of the thalo blue that's bleeding off the black. There we go. Bring this right up to the first circle. And then in the very back,
this is just brown and blue. Just dark, I want a nice
dark color back here. Maybe in this painting, the sun's sort of sneaking
through the clouds, and a big storm's coming. Okay, wash my brush. And we'll blend all this together. Looks mean and dark already. Just blend the sky together. There we go. Now, right in the center, I'm gonna take a little
bit of the titanium white on the one-inch brush, go
straight into the canvas, and build a happy little sun back here. There we are. With the knife, we take
off the excess paint, and we blend that together. Just so we have the indication of a sun. Now we can start the fun. Let me get the brush
clean, and off we'll go. I'm gonna use brown and blue. More brown than blue, because it is much much stronger. The blue is much stronger than the brown. Maybe we'll put just a
tiny bit of crimson in it. Okay, a little bit of paint, and we're really gonna
push this into the canvas. Get strong with it. Really, really push it into the material. Bend the knife. Push it in. There. There's really not a great
deal of paint on the canvas. It may look like it, but there's
really very little paint. And it's pushed very
firmly into that fabric. Okay. Now the clean dry brush, be sure it's dry, we're to start pulling that paint. There we go. Just pulling it. Very gently. Okay. Now, that went so nice,
let's go little bit further. Still using brown and Prussian blue, more brown than blue, we'll make some Almighty
storm clouds in here. Ooh, big storm's coming. There we go. All right now. Maybe use a little happy
cloud right down in here. Just grind that paint right
into the canvas, push it. Big cloud over here. There he goes. Really push the paint. Remember that you are the
creator and this is your scene. You can do anything that
you want to do here. But we decided that we wanted to build an Almighty storm today. There, really work that paint in. Maybe, far back in the distance, it's beginning to rain a little bit. Just pull that down. Make it look like there's a little rain way off in the distance. Now, with a large brush, I'm gonna blend this a little just to pick up the excess paint. The more of this excess you
can pick up, the easier it is. Don't want it to smear
all over the canvas. Now, if you're doing this at home with us, be sure your paint is very very firm. If you're using a thin oily paint, I can almost guarantee
you this won't work. Now then, let's put a
little bit of highlight on these clouds. Here just a little bit of titanium white. I'm just gonna sprinkle some
highlights here and there. Since this is a light source, we can always keep that in mind. Just a little bit. And a little bit over in here. There we go. Okay, a little bit up in here. We want to get rid of excess paint, because it will smear. So very gently, we take the knife and lift that right off. The value remains in the canvas. Just lift it off. And I suggest you wipe the
knife between each stroke, otherwise you'll put a big dark
line there when you go back. Okay, now that we've got
the excess paint off, we can take a large brush and very gently, very gently just blend this together. And it still gives the
impression of highlights without having the real bright colors. Because we want to retain
the darkness in this one. If you have an almighty storm coming, we gotta keep it dark
and cloudy, mean-looking. We're almost letting the brush
touch the canvas right here. Lift it, fluff it, blend it out. Now, a little more white. And right here, maybe
just some little clouds that just sort of float around here. There they are. Just let them fall in. With a large brush, very
gently, I'll blend those. And maybe you want to push
them even further back. If you do, put some more little
clouds right here in front. And you can just push those
further and further back. It creates a lot of
distance in your painting. So many techniques are very flat, and this has tremendous depth to it. And the rain way back in there. There we go, a little bit of that blue. Okay, maybe another happy little cloud. Just keep building depth in it. All right. Now then, let's start
making some water here. And I'm gonna start
with the palette knife, use a little bit of the titanium white, very very little. And where the black and
white meet on this canvas, automatically that'll
give you your water line, you don't really have to worry about it. Just touch. Start in the center and work outward. So it gets darker darker
darker as it works out. And here, all we're doing is laying just a little paint on the canvas. There we go. Just here and there. Were not too concerned about it yet, just let it fall wherever it pleases. Okay, with a large brush, clean and dry, just go across. And we just blend all that together. Now get to take a little
bit of the cad yellow, very small amount, and a little
bit of white mixed together, and right underneath here put
just a little touch of yellow. Just to make some pretty
little reflections there. Now there's blue underneath, so this yellow should turn
basically green when we blend it. Just to get some nice yellowish
greenish highlights here. With our large brush,
we'll blend this again. Look what happens. Oh, son of a gun. Okay, now ready to take our fan brush, and I'm gonna add a tiny little
bit of magic white to it. You need the magic white to thin it, just a little tiny bit. Very small amount. So the little bit thinner
than what's up there. And then we can start applying
little waves and stuff. And test your fan brush. You'll find it bends better one direction than it does the other. Keep the brush moving. Keep it playing. Let these little waves just
fall right out of it there. There we go. If you put one in that you don't like, just wipe back and
forth and it'll go away, or you can put little
shadows and highlights and stuff underneath it by doing that. There. And as we start getting closer, we begin putting just a
little more detail in there. Bad sea. The storm is coming. If you live close to the coast, it's a good time to be
finding a new house. Just let that fan brush
work and play in there. Choppy little waves. All these little things just happening. Maybe some little, way
back in the distance. There. Now, I'm gonna take a little
bit of alizarin crimson and van Dyck brown mixed together. And maybe we'll make, maybe
there's a little coastline back here, maybe there's a little hill that runs right back down into the water. There we go. Just the basic shape. Now, we need to take a
little bit more of the white, I'm gonna splash some waves up on this. Barely touch. Then give it a little
upward pull like that. Makes it look like that water's hitting and splashing up the edges. Okay, a little bit more
of the brown a crimson. And maybe we'll have
another one right here. What the heck, will put this one in front. Maybe he's a big Almighty cliff that comes right down to the water. There. Just have your brushstrokes
go in the direction you want the land to flow. Okay. Once again, a little
bit more of the white. Let's splash some up in here. Let it hit. Let the water slide up into the rocks. There we go. And over here, we need
some happy little things that are happening. And if you wanted to, you could take, and maybe put the silhouette
of a few little trees back here on this. Just take your little fan
brush and put them up. They're going to be in trouble soon if there's a storm coming. And line your brush with
a little bit of oil, and just put some little trunks. All we want is silhouettes way back here. Just here and there. Just to give the indication of something way back in the distance. There. Them trees are really gonna
catch the devil in a few days. Okay, we'll take a little bit of, use a tiny bit of ocher color here, and just very lightly put a little highlight here and there. Very lightly. Just enough to break it up a little. Make it look like little trees. I told you this one was crazy. Are you enjoying it so far? Good. Okay, a little bit more
of the white paint. Let's have an almighty wave in here. That son of a gun, it hits and splashes, like so. Let it go. Let it go. Maybe it's really splashing here and we have foam every which way. A lot of foam. And now we can begin working on the shape of this big wave here. It's really a big wave. It's just piling up, getting
ready to crash on some rocks. Okay, maybe it's beginning
to curl in some places. So let's just draw a little curl. And then we grab this
white and pull it over. Pull it over, pull it over. Just like so, grab and pull. And that creates that. And if you wanted to play a little bit, maybe there's a little
light shining through there, and creating a nice little
bright glow in there. We're gonna just put some
yellow right on top of that, and let it turn green. Little bit of white, just to let the light shine through there. Okay, back to the white. There we go. These strokes are most, most important. Now, grab another fan brush here. A little bit of the straight blue, and I'm gonna darken right
behind this, just a touch. Tiny little bit. Just darken it up a little. There we go. Now, we can come down here and
begin playing a little bit. Let this water splash up through here. We put it on, and then
we can take the big brush and a dull it down a little. And let's make a happy little
stone out here in the water. Right here. Water's crashing up against it. This is straight van Dyck brown. Just a big old stone out here. You thought I'd made a
mistake when I put that there. I knew it was gonna be there. Then I'll take just a
little bit of a umber, just straight umber, and we'll put a little
highlight on this stone. It's quite dark, so we don't
want to use bright highlight. Just straight umber. Something like so. There. Nice rugged stone. And we need some water that
splashing up on the stone here. Let that water run down. Follow right up the wave. There, let all these
little foamy things happen. And at home, where you
have unlimited time, you can have water dripping
all over the sides here. Oh, there's just a multitude of things that you can do with this. It's really the idea
we're trying to give you. And with that idea, then you're limited only
by your imagination. Let's go right into here. Maybe there's another little stone here. These stones are such fun,
let's just do several of them. Burnt umber. And we'll just lay a little
highlight on top of this one. There we go. Almighty stone. Okay, now we need a little bit of water splashing around this one. Maybe there's even a little over here. Once again, make it look like
it's running right up that. Okay. Just little things happening down here. All kinds of little actions
are going on in here. Let all these little waves
splash and play and have fun. If you're painting along with us at home, I bet you never believed
you could form this. You can do a seascape like this
in just a matter of minutes. Think what you could do
if you took the time. There's really no end to it. Now just lift up a little bit. Just to quiet it down a touch. We're having so much fun with stones here, maybe there's another one
over in here somewhere that the wave's just
fixin' to sneak up and get. You can put as many of
these in as you want, just let them happen. And a little more of the burnt umber. A touch. There's absolutely no
pressure on the knife when you're doing this. When you make these little
rocks, no pressure at all. It's just the paint touching the canvas. In your mind, remember the
blade's not touching the canvas. It's only the paint,
and there's no pressure. No pressure, barely barely touching. If you push hard, you're going
to just mush it in there, and it'll look like you decorated a cake. Okay now, put a little bit
of foam right around here. Just let it splash, right up the rocks. Make that action fast when
you do it, just real quick. Makes it happen so much better. Now if you wanted to show
a little bit of water, maybe dribbling over the rocks in places, use a very thin paint,
thin it with magic white. Make it very very thin. And touch, and just barely touch it. Barely barely touch it, let it play. See how you can make
that water just dribble right over the rocks? Okay. Like so. And maybe there's little
water coming right across the top here, and
just running down this rock. With all the splashing in
the foam carrying on here, there's got to be little
puddles all up on the top here. So just let this water dribble. Dribble, that's a word
I learned in the South. I like it. We've been doing a lot of classes for our friends in Florida, and they are fantastic people. We have really enjoyed being there. Okay. This is a little bright right in here, so I'm gonna take the large
brush, just very gently, touch it a little bit, and it'll take some of
the brightness away. It just blends into the colors underneath. Now, in case you joined a little bit late, let me quickly go over
what we've done here, because this is so radically different than anything we've done in the past. I started with a canvas, the bottom part of it was painted black, with a flat black acrylic
I'd allowed to dry. The top remains white. We cover the top with a
thin layer of magic white. On the bottom here, I made
a big circle of thalo green. And around that circle, I put mostly thalo blue, and then right around here, Prussian blue. Or you can do it all in Prussian blue. You really don't need that thalo blue, but if you have it, it's
a very warm sparkly blue that you might enjoy playing with. Then blend it all together with long horizontal and vertical strokes, right in here. And then we begin. The colors that we use are transparent. Be sure these colors under the
black canvas are transparent. If there's any doubt in your mind, put a little bit on some
black and look at it. If it doesn't look black still, then they're not transparent. But thalo blue, thalo green, sap green, Prussian
blue, alizarin crimson, all of these are very transparent colors, you can do fantastic things with them. Practice using them in combinations. Some of the pictures we do, we use stripes of different
transparent color. So play with it at home. You won't believe what you can do. Sometimes I talk too much. So I think will sign this painting. And I hope you've enjoyed it. I hope it's giving you a
lot of fantastic ideas, and will start your mind working and your imagination going crazy, and you too will come up with
some unbelievable paintings. So let's sign this one. I've thinned the paint
with a little bit of oil. And turn it to bring it
to a nice sharp point. Turn it. Okay. Boy, a signature in red really
stands out against this blue. But now once again, we've
mentioned on other shows, let us know what you want to see, and in the future we'll
try to produce paintings that you want at home, or
that you need some help with. So I think we're going to
call this painting finished. The old clock on the wall
tells me it's time to go and leave you for today. So on behalf of everybody here at WIPB, we like to wish each and
everyone of you happy painting, and God bless. Have a good day. (pleasant music)
