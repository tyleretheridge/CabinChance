- Welcome back. Glad to see you again. I thought today, we'd do a
nice little easy painting, that'll just bring a lot
of joy to your heart. So let's get started here. We're gonna start with a little bit... let's take a little bit of thalo blue, I like thalo blue, it's a
very nice warm, bright blue. Work it into the brush, we'll go right up here at the top, and just very quickly
drop us in a little sky. And use these little
criss-cross strokes, X strokes, leaves little places
open, don't cover it all, so it looks like you just painted back and forth with a bunch of blue. We want some life in the sky, want some action. There we go. And maybe we'll have a tiny
bit of water in this one, just play a little bit. I love water, hope you do too. So we'll just do that. Okay, now let's clean the brush. We just clean the brush with
an odorless paint thinner, shake off the excess paint, then beat the bristles dry
and cover the whole studio. There we go. Now we'll just blend this out. See all these little areas you left open? They look like little
things happening in the sky, it really makes a very effective,
quick, pretty little sky. There we go. Okay. Let's take the fan brush today, we'll play a little bit. I'm gonna take a little
bit of alizarin crimson just a small amount, and prussian blue. Now the prussian blue is
many, many times stronger than the crimson, so use
very little prussian blue. Just mix it right here
on the brush, like so. Now we're ready. Let's go up here and let's just put in a
basic little mountain shape. We'll just use a fan brush today so we don't have to work so hard. And there we are, just drop it in. That's a little bit redder than I want it, so we'll add a little bit of blue to it. We can change the color
right here on the canvas, that's no biggie, easy to do. The blue is so strong
it'll just consume it. There, that's a little better. I wanted it a little bit
more into the purplish hue. Seems like they wrote a song
about Purple Mountain Majesty, beautiful song. There we go. Now with a large brush, we can grab this and just pull it down. There we are. And that'll give us a
basic little mountain that's far, far away. We don't have to worry about a lot of detail in this mountain, 'cos it's too far away. We don't want a lot of detail into it. In some of our previous series, we've really worked
really hard on mountains to show you how to make them, this time, we've sort of avoided getting into all the
snow covered mountains and just want you to see how
to make some different things. Okay. Just by using brush strokes, you can make it look like
little things are happening and you really haven't done a darn thing, It's just impressions. There. Okay. That gives us a nice little
basic shape to play with. And then we'll wash this brush again, and we're ready to move right along. Okay, maybe, I'm gonna take a
little bit more of the crimson and prussian blue, and we'll make some little foothills way back in the distance. Gonna add a tiny bit of white to that. There we go. Sort of make a little
lavender color here, purple. I think we're ready. Now, we'll go right
back into the fan brush, we're having so much fun with it today, let's just use it for a while. Figure out here, basically, where you want your
little foothills to be. Let's start right here. And we're just gonna touch and go down. Just touch and go down. We just want distant trees here, we don't want a lot of detail. Put the detail in the foreground. Lack of detail sometimes
is as important as detail. When things are far, far away, you don't make out all the little details, you don't see every single leaf. All you see is basic shapes,
shadows, different colors, but you don't see all the little details. It disturbs me sometimes
when I look at paintings to see a tree that's
supposed to be ten miles away and you can count every leaf on it. Look out your window, you don't see that. There we go. Just some quick little foothills. Just drop 'em in. Okay now we can take the large brush, and I'm gonna just gently
tap the bottom of this. I wanna create a little
misty area right in here. I'm just using the corner of the brush just tapping. Then we'll lift it up. There we go. Now maybe, maybe there's a
few more trees right here, now because the mist is
there, these will stand out. It's the same color, but the mist will allow them
to stand out a little better. If you put dark against
dark you have nothing. You have to put dark against light, light against dark, continually, you have to play games with it. There we go, just like so, and we have some quick
little foothills back here. Now, let's go right in here, and I'm gonna add some sap
green right into this color. Just right into that lavender color. Mix it up good. Now maybe as they get closer, you're beginning to see more color. When things are far, far away from you, they have a blueish hue to 'em, it's because of water
molecules in the air. So, maybe here we're
getting into something that has a little more color, a little green to it. We'll just put another layer real quick. Just drop 'em in. Maybe I'll add a tiny bit
more of the green here, I want it get a little
greener than that even. Oh, that's much better. Much, much better. Just let some of these little
tones and values happen, don't over work 'em til they turn to mud. Create all kind of little things, maybe these come right down through here. And every time you put
another plain into a painting, it creates the depth in the painting. So often we work so hard to
put depth into a painting and it ends up looking flat. Work with layers, with plains. Each plain that you add increases the depth of the painting. Now, let's just drop some
little color in here, just a little bit. There we are. And already we have several
different plains here, one, two, three, four, right there, it'll really push that painting back. With a clean fan brush, I'm gonna take just a little
bit of titanium white, small amount, we'll make it look like little trunks way back in the distance. Just touch, pull straight up. Just a little, just a
little, don't overdo. Just a little. There, knew you could do it. There we are. Now, we'll take a fan brush
and put some yellow on it, little bit of yellow ochre and sap green. There we go. And then we can begin
highlighting back here. Just let some little things happen, and this covers up the bottom of the little trunks that you just laid in and brings it all together. Far, far away. We don't want a lot of detail yet. And maybe there's some nice
reflections right here, if we're gonna have a little pond, just grab the bottom of it, decide where your little
pond is, and pull down. Pull straight down. Let it pick up all the colors. And very gently go across. Isn't it something that you can make a beautiful reflection that fast. Maybe there's all kinds of little things happening out in there,
maybe some little peninsulas. Just drop 'em in, wherever
you think they oughta be. Then we'll take a little
bit of the Van Dyke brown, and let's put a little
bit of land back here, just here and there. all these little grassy things
have to have a place to sit. We can take some brown and white and a little bit of burnt umber and very gently highlight this. Just like so. Now, gonna use a little
bit of the magic white and we'll just very quickly drop us in a little water line back here, just a little light area to
sort of separate all of this. And we're using very firm pressure here, just literally cutting
right into the canvas. There we are. Okay. That gives us a pretty nice
little background to play with. Now we can get in here, and really have some fun. So let's go right into... there's some sap green,
a little bit of crimson, Van Dyke brown, maybe a
touch of prussian blue, just a very small amount. Okay, now, let's go right up in here, and we'll just begin dropping in some little basic tree shapes. And we're not worried
about detail here yet. We will in a minute, but at this point all we're doing is just dropping in basic, basic shapes. Don't worry about it. There we go. And you really push this
paint into the canvas, use a lot of pressure, just get in there and push. Bend the bristles. It's most important that
you bend these bristles, make all these little things happen. There we go. Wherever you think they oughta be, that's where they oughta be. Tell you what, while we have this nice color going here, we can just sort of fill up
the rest of the canvas with it. Okay. There we are. What a beautiful little spot, this reminds me of my home in Alaska. A couple of years ago... my mother lives in Florida, and I brought her up to Alaska took her salmon fishing, let her catch a great big salmon, and she had one heck of a good time. Okay. Now, while I still
have this brush loaded, let's just make a... I'll load a lot of
paint into the bristles, maybe there's a happy little evergreen that lives right there. Start off by just touching the canvas to sort of give you a guide. Use the corner of the brush at first, maybe this one runs
right on off the canvas. And just begin laying in a
beautiful little evergreen. Just like so. Here, we just have sap green, a little Van Dyke brown in
it just to dull it down. Just push that tree
right out of your brush. They live in there. Okay. Now we can start putting
some details in the rascal. Gonna take a little
bit of the burnt umber, a touch of van dyke brown in it, so we have burnt umber and van dyke brown. And let's put us in a basic trunk in this nice evergreen here. Always try to remember to do the thing that's farthest away first, so you have to make almighty decisions. Is this tree farther away, or is it closer? If it's far away, then
you want to do it first. Put a little highlight on it, a little brown and white, just
so it stands out a little. There, something like so. Now we can go back, we'll
just use a fan brush. These little evergreens can
be made with a fan brush, one inch brush, two and a half inch brush, just about anything. Now i've got sap green on here with a little yellow, and we can just come back and just lay some delicate
little highlights here and there. Just let that brush work around and play. Just let it bounce here and there. Don't want to kill all that beautiful dark that you put in there. As you work down the tree, things should get darker and
darker and darker and darker as you come down. So by allowing the brush to
pick up the colors underneath, automatically that happens, you don't have to spend a lot
of time worrying about it, it happens. Okay now, let's get us a one inch brush and begin highlighting
some of these things. I'll use a little cad yellow
with some sap green in it. Just mix it on the brush so you have a multitude
of colors happening here. Let's go right over here on the right side and just begin putting in
some beautiful little leaves here and there, just
drop these rascals in, let 'em fall off your brush. And worry about shape in your tree. What makes a tree round? Look at how the leaves are. There's patterns in nature, and you need to leave
these dark areas in there. If you kill all the dark areas, your trees are gonna be very very flat. Very flat, they'll have no shape. Maybe a few little trunks here and there. Just a little bit of van dyke brown. There's a little trunk right
there in that little bush. Maybe there's some trees
over here in the foreground. You don't really have to
make any big decisions yet. In a minute you will. There's another little trunk, just grown right down like that. And while I've got this
brown on the knife here, van dyke brown with a
little touch of ombre in it, now we can begin maybe... maybe there's some
ground showing in places. So we just lay it in at random right now, we're not too worried about it. Just putting the dark in, so when we highlight this, it'll look like land. Maybe this time it comes right down here. Wherever you want it. There we go. Gotta have a way to walk out here and catch that big trout that
lives out there in that lake. I'm gonna take some brown and some white, maybe we'll put a tiny, tiny,
little bit of blue in it, just to gray it down a little bit, and very gently here, using no pressure, no pressure, just let this
glide right across it. And you want the paint to break like this so it has little holes in it. Let some of that dark show through. You don't wanna kill all that dark that you've worked so
hard to put in there. Let it show through. There we go. Alright. Now we can go back to putting
some highlights on the bushes and the trees and bring all that together. Little yellow ochre, sap green, load the brush full of
paint, full of paint, probably the biggest mistake made when you're painting at home is not putting quite
enough paint in the brush. It takes a lot of paint, and then a very delicate touch here. We're not using a lot of pressure, just barely, barely touching the canvas. And because the paint on
the canvas is very firm, the thin paint will stick to it. If your paint doesn't stick, then it's not thin enough. Just begin working out
little individual bushes. When you're doing these, do one little bush at a time. I know sometimes when you're watching it looks like you just sock the canvas and a whole bunch of bushes appear. But they're done one at a time. Each one is an individual, each one has a personality. So separate 'em when
you're in this foreground. That's what creates distance, that you can see layers
and layers and layers of bushes and trees. Alright. Let's go back in here
and begin layering these. There we are. Now, if we can look right in here, you can see there's 1,
2, 3 layers right there. That's what leads the
eye into the painting. Spend some time working on that. It's worthwhile. It'll pay you great dividends in the end, make you happy. Of course, no one's
interested in monetary gains, but if you should be, that's what sells the painting. There we are. Okay. Little bit more of the sap green. We can just drop some
beautiful little leaves right out here on this tree, and it's in front of the evergreen, so show that in your painting, and it pushes that evergreen back, makes it far, far away. All kinds of little things happening here. Now let's go back to the fan brush. It makes such nice, soft,
little grassy areas. Just begin falling right down like this. Now this is where the lay of
the land becomes important. So pay attention to the
angles that you're using here. Don't just throw them in at random. Follow the lay of the land. I want this to sort of look like maybe there's a little hill
there, a little incline. So do it in layers, doing the
thing furtherst away first and working forward. Gonna put some little
happy things in there. Let a little bit of this ground area show through here and there. Don't kill it all. It's so easy to do when you get started, it turns into fun, and the next thing you know, you've covered up the whole painting. There. Okay, now we can take just a clean knife, use the point of the knife, and just scrape some little
sticks and twigs here and there. These also show different
plains in the painting and help create the illusion of distance. Let's go right over here, maybe we can drop a few in here. And if you want a big stick, turn the knife sideways and pull. That'll give you bigger sticks. There we go. Alright, now maybe... Composition wise, maybe this needs a nice big
tree that lives right here. So let's take some van dyke brown and let's build us a tree right there. Just make a decision and drop him in and go with it. I love trees. They're one of the most
beautiful things in nature. And each one has a personality. Study 'em. Make friends with 'em. Spend some time in the woods and just talk to a tree. I know that sounds crazy. All I'm trying to do it to
get you to look at trees, and to understand the beauty, and understand what makes a tree a tree. What makes each one different. There we go. Now maybe he's got a little
arm that lives right here. Let's just let it wander right on up. There it goes, there it goes. There. Now we can go back in here, make this trunk a little bigger. There. And we can begin putting all
kinds of little limbs here. And you can also use a
liner brush with a thin oil to draw in all these small limbs, or it's a super good way
to practice with a knife. You learn control of the knife, and make it your friend. There. There's one. I see it right there. It goes up like that. Maybe, maybe... Yup, there it is. Another one right there. So just let your tree flow
right out of your imagination. But have a basic understanding
of what makes a tree. Okay, now, let's take a tiny bit of yellow ochre, a little bit of burnt
umber, mix it together. And we can put a little bit
of highlight on this trunk. There we are. Just to make it stand out. Just highlight the side you
think light would hit on. You have to make determinations
where your light source is. Where the light's coming from
throughout the whole painting. Just here and there. Okay. Now we can lay some dark color in here and then we'll highlight the dark color and that'll turn out to
be the beautiful leaves that live on this tree. Load a lot of paint onto the brush. I'm using sap green, van dyke brown, and let's put a touch of
prussian blue into it. Prussian blue'll really,
really darken it up. Okay, now I want these leaves to be nice, loose and airy so you can see through 'em, and still make out a little
bit of the background behind. So don't kill all your background. Just barely touch the canvas. Barely, barely touch. Leave some air in here. Leave some places for
the little birds to sit. There we are. Okay now maybe over
here on this little limb put some dark color, just so our highlight'll show up. You need the dark in order to have light. Okay. Now we can go back here with a thin paint. And we'll use a color that's... Let's use a pretty, bright yellow here. A little bit of green in
it, but mostly yellow. We need quite a bright colour to make it stand out
from all the background. Once again, leave this loose and airy. So we can see through it so we can see that there's
a mountain back there. Creates tremendous depth and
interest in your painting. Look at that. Just barely touch. Barely, barely touch the canvas. Don't kill all that dark, your tree will get flat, we don't like flat trees. There. Maybe there's a little bit
right out in here, like so. And right over here, you need this light color to bring it out from the
evergreen that's behind it. There we are. Now we can take the fan brush, and very gently here put a little bit of the grassy area around his foots and bring all that together, like so. Okay, I think we have a painting that's about ready for a signature here. So let's take a little
bit of the thin oil, little bit of permanent red, and we'll just sign this rascal. Next week we'll be doing a white canvas, so have your easel set up, big glass of ice tea there beside you. Join us, I think you'll enjoy it. There we have that one signed. And with that, the old clock on the wall
tells us it's time to go. I'd like to wish each and every
one of you happy painting, see you next week. God bless. (cool elevator music)
