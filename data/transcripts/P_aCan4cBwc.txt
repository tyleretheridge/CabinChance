I'm certainly glad you could join me today let's do a fantastic painting together day I thought today we'd do a happy little seascape and I've got a black canvas up here as you can see and we make these black canvases by covering them completely with black gesso and allowing that to to dry and then on top of that I've added on the top portion here I've added a mixture of midnight black and a little bit of phthalo blue mixed with it and same thing down here except for one little strip I've added a little bit of phthalo green so we got midnight black they little blue a little midnight black and phthalo green right in here and we'll have a big wave I think in here right across here slightly above Center I have a piece of masking tape so that'll give us a nice straight horizon let's start out and having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this picture and we're going up here and get started today let's start out with the old two-inch brush show you a very simple little sky let's go right into titanium white now once you put these colors on the on the black canvas is covered with a black gesso don't allow the don't allow these colors to dry this this blue and black that we have appear don't allow that to dry before you start okay I've got a little bit of titanium white on the brush so let's go up here and maybe maybe there's a big look here we'll just come right along in here and do something like that we're gonna check you out for bravery today just just bring it right in here let's see it's going to pick up the color that's on the canvas and all kinds of fantastic little things will happen won't that a little brighter right in there now I'm just gonna start using little X's little X's and blend it now this continually will mix with the color that's on the canvas and things will happen beautiful little things will happen I'll pull that straight down right here like there's a little light coming out from under this big cloud there see just pull it down like so this is a nice easy way to make a very effective sky and you can also use this for landscapes as' it's not only for seascapes it'll work with some of your landscapes that you're doing to just use a little crisscross strokes and blend it can just to be a little brighter in here this is going to be my light source so we want this to be a little bit brighter right through here Mike thank that easy okay now up in here up in here this is going to be a big old cloud so it's going to be the brightest area is going to be right here hit the lights behind this big cloud so we'll start here with our lightest color and just let it blend outward but I want to retain this dark edge why this is going to be a mean-looking old seascape the storms coming better get out you're waiting boots if you live close to the ocean mm-hm good dark sky means guy and when you're painting make up little stories think about it think about little things that are happening in in your mind just just visualize little things and it'll help you create the mood that you're looking for there we go I know that maybe we've grabbed an old fan brush here still using just titanium white just load little color on here back and forth maybe there's a happy little cloud that lives right up in here and just use the corner to brush just the corner of the brush and you can put a little cloud in there we just put a couple in so you can see how to dub and when you do your seascape you put as many or as few in as you want maybe there's one he does right there he lives right there and he's got a little friend named George he floats right around out here there we go okay now we can take the large brush and I just want to blend the base of this cloud out touching the top yet at all see just the base then give it a little upward flip and lightly blend it and that easy you got a super little cloud little mutt here little bit there give it a little fluff blend and there's a couple more clouds and that easy you have a fantastic little sky thank you like this one's a lot of fun nothing helps you like cleaning the brush that's the most fun in this whole technique now then as I said we had a piece of masking tape across here now when we pulled this off that'll assure us that we have a nice straight horizon and it's one of the easiest ways I've ever found of being sure that your horizon is nice and straight okay now then we can take a little the black and a little bit of the blue and just rub a little color right left on here that's all covered there we are and we're ready huh to wash the brush one more time 8:2 devil out of it let's take a let's take a whole number six filbert brush one of the easiest ways I found of making seascapes is to just take and put in a very loose basic sketch of where you want your major wave to be so come right down here and let's let's make a big decision maybe right in here we'll touch and let's just put in a big ol wave that lives right along there he comes up here maybe he will crash over right there but that out like so and that's really all you need that'll give you give you sort of a guide to work from wash my little filbert okay let's take a fan brush we put a little white on it and we make some of these little waves it away back in the distance here this is your light area right in here so I start here I just begin rubbing a little bit of color this is just a straight titanium white but it's picking up the color that's on the canvas so all these little things will just automatically happen and just just let your hand sort of rock here so you get little openings in there there we go and a few of them over here kinetic just work right I don't know if this is our light area start here and work toward the site allowing it to get darker and darker as you work away from under that light area there we go see how easy that is if it makes a beautiful little looks like a little ocean back in there there we are just red key now that we need some big strong waves in there a little more white on the brush figure out where they're gonna be it will come right up in here go bloop gotta make those little noises and maybe it comes right on back here we know somewhere back in there what the devil we don't care maybe we'll hit one more right here wherever you think they should live like so okay now we'll wipe off the paint wipe the paint off my fan brush and very very lightly here I just want to grab this and begin blending it back just begin blending it back like so see but the angle here is very very important very important and say that little dark edge right there see that's what makes it settle out okay now we do that right here and then a super neat little way to make some happy little waves and it's very easy very easy let's put a little more paint right in here like so then we can do the same thing here on this one just blend it back there we go see seascapes don't have to be all that hard okay same thing here put a little paint I like this part that's that's the part that really crashes in there blend it back also little bit right there and you can see how that's beginning to to make all your little a little wave effects we'll come back and we'll highlight that and really bring some son of a guns out a little later on but right now we're just looking for background material wash your fan brush can I have some paper towels over here that I dry the brush against just wash them and pin thinner didn't dry them on a paper towel let's take we'll take some white and the least least little touch of yellow I'm using the filbert brush here but white and the least touch of CAD yellow still should almost look white but there is a little bit of yellow in there okay let's make the fun part let's make the eye of the wave here are the transparency whatever you want to call it okay to scrub in a little bit of color and then let it will start working back back back back darker darker darker as it gets away from it Heather you may want to do this step several times to achieve a desired lightness and you can do it over and over and over till it gets as lighter and as bright as you want it okay let's go back throw in a little more color each time you do it it's gonna get a little brighter a little bit brighter but each time clean your brush before you take it back into them to the transparency otherwise it'll it'll drag a little dirty color right back in there and you'll be unhappy one more time hmm all right Sun up against gonna shine now that's what we're looking for okay of course you become a an expert brush washer by the time this one's over good dry two inch brush now I want to go in here and here all we're doing it just barely grazing it just barely barely caressing it we want to soften that very gentle as we come out here we can begin working on the shape of this wave see I cap see there let's grab it and begin again forming this son of a gun I mean that easy I know you could do it it's one of the nicest little ways to make seascapes I've ever seen there all I'm doing is knocking the loose paint off the brush the hair we are okay and I grab my old fan brush let's go into some of that white with a little touch of yellow and I mean just the smallest smallest amount possible smallest amount of yellow and let's go ahead up in here and let's make this whole wave crashing over take how the water would turn over here and spill out okay it comes again you don't make as little sounds that won't work CAD make a little seance there it goes again okay and right here we're little water just pouring over here I like the water I was born and raised in Florida but then I moved off to Alaska well what a change it's been about 12 years of my life in Alaska lived in Fairbanks for many many years beautiful country beautiful country okay now then let's put some foam out here I like to do the foam that's a lot of fun so for that we get the old filbert brush I want to take a little bit of a little bit of blue a little bit of blue and a little touch of bright red blue little touch a bright red like so gonna make sort of a lavender color okay maybe a little bit of white a oh it's nice that's nice there we go all right let's start right up in here and just sort of scrub that in just give it a little push see push once again make those little noises this is just a shadow we'll come back and put the nice parts on here in just a second all we're doing now is just laying in a shadow on this is going to come up here and it's going to crash and splash and we'll put a big stone in there but right now let's just have it so just really raising the devil okay yeah yeah we put put the frosted on this cake plans take a little bit of the white with a least little touch of CAD yellow into a least little touch just load that brush full both sides can scope here and it start right out in here and all you're doing is just pushing push on that up stroke is when that splash comes off the end turn the brush over use both sides of it okay and then sometimes you have to wipe it off and reload it but always wipe it when you reload it wipe it off see it's nice and clean and you come back in here splashmore just all kinds of big splashes happening in here okay hmm oh there we go here's he's just flying all up in here like so okay now they're back to our big old two-inch brush we go use just the corner of it just the corner and very lightly making tiny tiny little circular strokes tiredness little circular strokes we want to blend that together very lightly make it very soft just do this like so there we go and you can blend this so much it'll go away and leave you just want to blend until it gets nice and soft and looks like it's really turning and carrying on there okay okay now then let's go back into some white here let's have some thought maybe down in here right yep right here maybe there's a knot a little way that lives right in there just be brave throw that son-of-a-gun yin and then I want to blend that back and you notice up here at a little green we put in really shines but down here it's in the shadow areas this is more in the shadows blue and black really work nice sort of sort of have in your mind what you're going to do when think about where you lay in the colors when you lay them on there so now we can begin blending this together and then super nice easy little way to make a make a happy little happy little wave right there maybe this way you comes up here and splashes right over here maybe there's a big rock right underneath here who knows who knows in your world you can do anything that you want to do maybe this comes down and splashes right up through here I don't know just wherever you want it just let the water go and all we're using here is just titanium white it's all we're using let that water run up through there and blend it back very softly see you can do it maybe it comes here maybe we said there was a big stone there there just wherever you want it there can almost see through that hmm Oh kinds of things happening out of this water we don't know what's happening here okay now we can begin creating some little foamy things are just coming right on down hey this helps form and shape your waves need some shape in here there oh so I don't plan right up the wave however you think they should go so to follow the angles but you can just play in bright little highlights okay you won't take my liner brush now and go right into titanium white with a little paint thinner on the rice a little paint thinner just at the end the paint and let's go right up in here and let's begin adding some of these nice little thanks this is paint thinner with titanium white and we can put a little edge right out here on this wave just a happy little edge and maybe there's all kind of little things just splashing right on down here your paint needs to be very very thin a consistency of ink being is put all these little rascal wherever you are but follow out of the basic shape here even back in here some little things heaven and if you get one that's a little bit bright all you have to do is just paint over a couple of times and it'll pick up the dark colors underneath and it'll blend right out to any degree of lightness or darkness that you want but in little light areas just by doing that maybe right down Cresta this here little things are happening all kinds of little good or okay but once again now you tired of hearing it follow the basic angle in this way don't just throw these on at random let's go up in here put on a few little gooders and put some little lands in here now at home you have a lot of time and you can put all these little sounder guns in that you want just one after the other and you can make one fantastic little seascape and it's quite easy doing it this way quite easy you'd be surprised what you can do there okay now right into this light area you want your brightest and as you work out add more blue the more the phthalo blue so these out here aren't as bright just wherever you want and it tell you what let's do let me find anything there it is old fan brush will go right in some Van Dyck Brown a little dark sienna dis mix them together on the brush here we said was going to have a big old stone right here so let's come right along in here and maybe yep there it is right down into the crasher we have us a big old stone was right there the Eagle stone he stood here four thousand years or so on the waves a bead on him that's how I feel like I've been standing in for a thousand years and getting beat on you know that feeling okay now we'll take these little touch that's not true these little touch it bright red and just just put the indication here in there a little bit of highlight sparkling on this I don't want to overdo this is the way you can form all your rocks very easily just decide where you thinking are drop them in see they're create all kinds little little petrosian's little things and it go right there here's another one just whatever but everything we can take the brush that has as the Hawaii Don it and we can come in here we can just sort of lift upward and make an indication like is water spilling down over through here maybe back in here there's little things happening now you can just begin adding some little details here and there tell you what let's put another rock over on this side shoot we don't want it left out maybe maybe there lives a rock here see that's alright that's right now just thrown Van Dyke Brown dark sienna it would take a little bright red I'll come right back in here when this is our light source it would be highlighted on the opposite side like that put in a few little gooders back to our fan brush here that has the white on it I could tell that water just spilling all off here Oh Ken's a little things happen take the liner brush and really put some nice little water lines on where it's all coming off but for all kinds of happy little details in here ceci at home you have all kinds of time and you can just you can just work with this and put all these little little areas and little highlight spots it'll really make a beautiful painting beautiful painting you can even take a little color and punch in some holes like looks like there's holes in the foam that easy I think we got a painting here that's ready for signature take a little bright red on the liner brush thin it down with paint thinner and I'll sign this one I certainly hope you've enjoyed this little seascape it'll teach you a great deal give you hours and hours of pleasure and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and god bless you you you
