- Hi, I'm glad to see you today. Glad you could join me. Today I thought we'd do a black canvas And I've taken a black canvas here and I've covered the whole thing with Alizarin crimson and Thalo blue. And I just sort of mixed them on the brush and just covered the entire canvas. So I'll have 'em graphically
run all the colors that you need across your screen. And you can see the colors
that we're gonna use to do this beautiful
little painting today. And while they're doing that, let's get started. So I say this is Alizarin
crimson and Thalo blue. So it's sort of a purplish color up here. We hope. We hope. It's hard to see. Take a little bit of
white on the large brush. Let's go right up here and just lay a little
bit of color in the sky. This is just plain white, but it's picking up the purplish color that we have underneath. Just a little titanium white. Just let it bounce around and play. And if everything works just right, when this painting's done I don't think it's gonna
look like a black canvas. I think it'll look like a white canvas. Just wanna show you how
versatile some of these black canvases are. They're some of the most
fantastic things going. There we are. That'll give us just a little
bit of color in this sky. A little purplish hue. Know you can make this any color you want. If you want it to be
more of a bluish color, then have more Thalo blue than crimson. And automatically you'll have that. Okay, let's wash the brush. What the heck. And we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner. Beat 'em dry. Now we're in business. Let's take a little fan brush today. Let's build a happy little
cloud up in the sky. And I'll use some titanium
white on the fan brush. And put a lot of paint into the brush. A lot of paint. Let's go up to the canvas here. Use just a corner of the brush. And very quickly we'll just drop in some happy little floaters around here. Little clouds are free. They just sort of float
around and have fun. Just let 'em go wherever. Gotta make these decisions. Where are they at? Okay, now we'll take our big brush. It's clean and dry. Very gently. Very gently. Blend this out. Hey, it also is picking up
that color that's underneath. That first coat of paint that
we put on this was put on with very firm paint. Very dry, firm paint. So you can do all this blending without becoming a mud mixer. If you use thin, oily paints here and you try to do all this, you're gonna become a mud mixer. And gonna be upset with me. And I don't want to be unhappy. Gently blend across. And that easy. That easy. That's very effective. Beautiful little clouds. That's all there is to it. Okay, we can clean the old brush again. This really may be the most fun
part of this whole technique is cleaning the brush. Oh, you can take out all your hostilities. Alright, maybe there's a
little footy hill back here. A little foothill. And let's take, we just
mix on the brush here. Some Thalo blue, a little crimson into it, and let's use some Sap
green right into it. And this is just mixed with a brush. Shoot, no big deal. Put a little white in there and we can see what color we got. Okay, I'm add a little brown. I want to dull it, too bright. Too bright. So you can dull right down. Put a little brown in
it, that'll dull it down. Okay, a lot of paint on the brush. Let's go up to the canvas. Maybe there lives a little foothill. Yeah, you're right. There he is. And just use the corner of the brush. And we'll just put a basic little foothill shape right in there. Just like so. Let it go. There. And all you're looking for
is a very, very basic shape. Now, I take the large brush. Grab it and pull it down. Pull it down. That easy. And just by changing the
direction of the brush, you can make the illusion of
all kinds of little highlights and shadows just by changing
the direction of the brush. Especially on these black canvases. You want to create mist
down at the bottom. Take a little white on the brush. Very little. Very, very little. And just tap it in. Color shows up a hundred times stronger on the black canvases, than it does on the white ones. So use very, very little color. Very little. And just tap in a little bit. And that will create the
illusion of mist up here. Let's pull those right out. And very lightly can blend all that. And lift it upward. It's a super nice way to
make some little foothills that are far away. Very quiet. Okay. Now, tell you what let's do ... Let's clean that old fan brush. Okay, now let's make
another range of hills here. And maybe for this one, let's use ... Thalo blue and Van dyke brown. Blue and brown. Want this one very dark. I put a little white in the other one. This one, I don't want any white in. As things get closer to
you in the landscape, it should get darker in value. So here comes a little hill. Right there. Very dark. Very dark. Blue and Brown. Blue and brown. There it goes (grunts). Right there. Right there. Just lay in a little color. See how easy that is? And already you begin to
see another range here. We're working with different planes. The more planes you have in a painting, the more depth you'll have in a painting. And sometimes when I'm painting these I'll make 'em smaller and put oh, goodness sometimes eight or ten foothills in here. And you look like you can just look back and see forever. On a clear day, of course. Let's go in here and now ... Tell you what, let's take
a little Permanent red. A little Permanet red. A little burnt umber. And we just sort of mix that together. And let's go right up in here. Maybe there's a little red right in here. Let's begin adding a little color. This is getting close enough now that we're beginning to see color. So we can add a little color in and maybe it comes right down. Like so. Shoot, there might be even
a little bit right over, wherever you want it. Just throw in a little color. Permanent red, burnt umber. Just put it in. Now, we're gonna take this big brush and gently tap that. I want to soften it. So it just blends right in. But you'll still be able to see a little of that reddish hue. Still don't want it too bright. It's too far away. Too far away. Too far. There. But you see how you can
see every brush stroke in these black canvases. Mm-kay. Now, while we got this color on the brush, add a little white to it, this burnt umber, permanent red. A little tiny bit of titanium white. Maybe back in here. Maybe, there it is. Maybe there's a little tree,
bush something right there. There's another one. Ain't that fun. Ain't that fun. Painting used to drive me crazy. I was a traditional
painter for many years. You really don't have to
agonize over paintings. You don't have to be blessed
by Michelangelo at birth. You can paint. You can paint. Okay, that'll give us like a little, a little growth of trees back in the back. I'm gone take now, back to
the two and half inch brush go into a little cad yellow. Oh, we'll add a little sap green. A little sap green, cad yellow. And maybe, maybe, maybe ... Tell you what, I want a little more sap green. There, wanted it quite dark
right there underneath. Sap green, a little cad yellow. Maybe there's a little plain out here. A little meadow. Now, let's add a little
more of the cadmium yellow. Let it get a little brighter. There, as it begins working out from that. See that? Now, if your paint will not stick well, add a little paint thinner to your brush. Just a little though. Oh, a little tiny bit. A little tiny bit. Takes a very little. See this is creating another plane. Now I'm gonna add a little yellow ochre. Maybe a little bit of Indian yellow. See, just by changing
the color a little bit, it makes it look like another plane. And every time you add another plane, you create more depth in your painting. Another dimension. Another dimension. And that's really what
painting is all about. Is to make it look deep, far away. Just walk right back into this painting. There we go. Now, when you're doing this if you want to make
something a little darker there's color underneath here. So all you have to do is tap on it. And automatically it'll
pick up the color underneath and it gets darker. So, just work it. And you can make it dark,
dark, dark right on down 'til it's almost black again. If you wanted to. But anytime you want to create a shadow, or you want to make an
area darker, tap it. That's all there is to it. And you can soften it, make it darker. Darker, darker, darker ... You can make this look almost like velvet. Looks almost like lace
just laying out there. There. Alrighty, tell you what, let's do ... Maybe there's some big trees that grow around the side. I'm a go right into some Van Dyke brown, a little crimson Alizarin crimson, sap green and just mix 'em on the brush here. Pull that brush in one direction. One direction. And now look at this brush. Look at this brush. Look at all the paint in end of it. There you can really see it. Look at the amount of paint. And there's a slight curve cause you pulled it in one direction. You want that curve to be on top. Let's go to the canvas. Now when you touch the canvas, touch it and push. Look at there. Look at that. Look at that. Isn't that exciting. Look at all those thousands of leaves. Now you could set there
with your one haired brush for a week trying to do that. Or you can do it in one
stroke with an almighty brush. Look at that. Don't be afraid of it. Load a lot of paint into the brush. Probably the biggest single mistake made is people don't put
enough paint in the brush. And then they have to
hit the canvas so hard. Put a lot of paint in the brush. Have fun with it. Okay, same colors, brown,
green, Alizarin crimson. Maybe, there it is. There it is. Just sort of look at your painting. Evaluate it. Make a decision and go. And go. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it, have fun with it. Just push it in there. Bend those bristles and go. Don't let the brush slide. Don't let the brush slide. It's very important. You don't want that brush to slide. Now maybe ... There's some water down here. Let's ... I see water down here. So if you want water, all you have to do is
take this old big brush and go right into a little
bit of titanium white. Decide where you want the water to be, touch and pull down. Touch and pull down. You're gonna pick up that
color that's underneath, and automatically you get water. Look at there. Look at there. That simple. Wherever you want. Wherever. Touch, pull straight down. Now it's important that
you pull straight down. Straight down. Now sometime it reflects
a little bit from the sky. So maybe there's a little white right in wherever you want it, wherever. It's reflected out of the sky. Just drop it in, pull straight down. Go right across it. Add just a little bit of thalo blue. Maybe it'll give it just a
little more of a blue hue. Blue hue. There you go. Just like so. Now after you pull it straight down, go gently across. Oh, isn't that something. Just go across. Now brush strokes are very important. Especially on these black canvases. See there? But that easy. Instant water. 'Kay, now we can come back in here and begin putting some
beautiful little highlights on some of these. And making all kinds of little
trees and bushes out of 'em. We'll go right in to some yellow ... Let's hit some sap green. There we go. A lot of paint in the bristles. Yellow and sap green. Maybe right up here in this old, big tree. Touch, just like we
did with the big brush. We load it the same way. We touch the canvas the same way. Barely, barely touching. Just enough to bend the bristles a little. And once again, you need a lot of paint. A lot of paint. We'll sort of vary some colors. Maybe we'll go right into
a little yellow ochre here. We don't know how many trees this is growing here in this clump. There could be several. Your trees, so however
many you want in there. That's what you put in. Maybe there's a little
permanent red added to it. Just to brighten it up. Now, we don't know how many
trees are in this clump. Maybe this is one. Just let 'em happen. Don't kill all your dark areas. Most important that you save some of them. You kill all your dark areas,
it's gonna get very flat. Very flat, and we don't want a flat tree. We want a nice bright, shiny tree. Okay, let's go over to the
other side of the canvas. And over there we can add a little more, got a little more green,
a little more yellow. Let's go right in here
to this big, old tree. Oh, that's a beautiful green. Beautiful green. Look at that. Let's put some yellow ochre. It's a beautiful, little shiny bush. Happy little bush. Happy bush. We only have happy bushes. Go back into a little more of that green and just sort of let
it play back and forth. Let all these little things happen. Let 'em all happen. See there? Can do. There's one. Wherever you want 'em. Maybe, maybe, maybe ... There's one. Add a little permanent red to this one. Make it stand out a little. Okay, if your paint won't stick well, add a little paint thinner to your brush. And it'll stick with any problem. It can go right over anything. Thin paint sticks to a thick paint. Alright, let's take our liner brush. A little paint thinner, and
go right into some brown. Bring it to a nice sharp
point by turning it. Let's go up here and put
some little limbs and sticks. Maybe ... There's one, comes right out of the top. Right on top. And he's got a friend
that lives right there. And he comes right down in there. See sometimes you have,
in trees you have limbs. Just individual limbs ... Well, they go to the happy hunting ground. But they're still there and
they're still beautiful. Don't leave 'em out. These little branches are so pretty. So pretty. Everything in nature is pretty. Use it. Maybe, there it is. Comes right (sighs) there. Wherever you want it. There we go. There we go. Isn't it fun to just set and
create such beautiful things? Let's go into a little white. Leave that color on the brush. Go right into a little bit of white. Maybe there some here. A little different color. Paint thinner. See? Let all these little things happen. These little changes in color. Ah, they make things exciting. They make you happy. Make you happy. There, all kinds of things. Let's go back to some of the brown. Some of the brown. This Van Dyke brown. Let's go to the other side. Maybe there's some limbs over here, too. We sure don't want him to feel left out. Just here and there. Here and there. Okay, maybe ... There's one. Go back to my paint thinner. And go right back into the white paint. I haven't cleaned the brush though, you still have all that brown in there. And maybe ... You're right, there it is. You were right. Just let these things happen. Look at there. See, and you didn't
have to clean the brush. And I'm lazy. If I don't have to clean
the brush, I like it. (chuckles) I like it. Maybe he's got a little
friend that lives right there. I'll tell you what let's do. Let's take ... Go right into some of this green and all the yellows and red. It's all right here. This is all mixed here. Let's just tap. This is the same old
dirty brush I was using to do the background. And here we'll add a little
bit, a little grassy areas here and there. And once again here, I'm just tapping. Just be very soft. A little flat feel. See? That's all there is to it. All there is to it. There, just let it go. Maybe it comes right up ... Right up the hill here. Wherever you want 'em to go. That's where they go. Did you ever think
painting could be so easy and so much fun? It can. Really can. There's no big secret to it. Learn a few basic rules and let it happen. All you need is a dream and your heart. Alrighty, tell you what, let's put ... some land down here. A little bit of dirt. Take a little Van Dyke
brown, a little burnt umber mixed on a knife. Okay, and then we'll go up here. And all we're gonna do is just touch. Just let the knife bounce around and play. A little more paint. Oh, just play with it. Wherever it goes, let it happen. Let's go over on the other side now. Right in here. There it goes again. These things they just wander
everywhere you want 'em. This is also the way you
sort of clean up the bottom of your grassy area. It'll clean it up, make
it nice and pretty. This is Van Dyke brown, burnt umber. Wherever you want 'em. Now then we'll take a little
bit of titanium white, a little blue, and a little brown. So we got white, blue and brown. Sort of a very light gray color. A little bit of paint on the knife. Let's go right up here. And I just barely touch it. Oh, just let it just graze across the top. Just barely, barely touch. Whisper lite. Barely, barely touch. Can't say that enough. Okay, there. And then it's so fantastic
to be privileged enough to be here on television with you. I have made hundreds
and hundreds of friends across the country. It's a super pleasure to be
invited into your home each week to spend a half an hour with you. And I thank you. I really enjoy being with you. You've become a very
close and dear friend. And I want to wish you the best. And hope these paintings bring
a little joy into your life. And teach you a little something. Take a little magic white now into that. And the least little amount of ... Least little amount of thalo blue. Least little amount. Now to put some little waterlines in here, take the knife, pull this out very flat. And then, cut across. And you come right up underneath here and add in little waterlines. Just like so. Just like so. And you can put as many of
these in here as you want. Just let 'em go. Let 'em go. There, now they need to
be basically straight. If they're not straight, your painting ... your water will right
out of your painting. Started to say your painting would run right out of your water. But we know that's not right. There, and just wherever you want 'em. Let's go to the other side over there. And add a few over here. I'm gonna have some on this side. Don't want it to get jealous. There we go. And you know another thing if you enjoy these shows, let your station know. Shoot, that's the only way they know. If you like something, call 'em up. Spend a minute with them. Tell them what you like. That's the way you get
different shows on television or you keep shows on there that you like. Or you get reruns if you want 'em. Let 'em know. They need to know. I'm gonna take and add a couple more little twigs and little sticks maybe. Right in here. Just to break that up some. Just to break it up. Okay, like that. Here and there. And I think we're ready. We're on the verge of
having a completed painting. This painting is, as I
said in the beginning, has a temendous amount of depth. There's plane after plane. It really is a super fun painting to do. If you're interested
in selling a painting, it'll put a happy buck. So I'll take a little paint thinner, and go right here. And we'll drop a little signature on. The old clock on the wall tells me I've got to leave you for the day. But I'll be back. And from all of us here, happy painting. God bless.
