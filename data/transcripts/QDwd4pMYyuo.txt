Hi. Welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Cause I thing today I
think we'll do a painting that you'll certainly enjoy. Let's start out and have
the run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've done today. I have my standard ol'
pre-stretched, double-primed canvas. But today I've taken, as you
can plainly see on the bottom, I've put liquid black and on the top liquid white. And then I've just sort
of blended them together. So there's just a graduation of, from solid black to solid white. And I think we'll just have some fun. Now liquid black is exactly
the same thing as liquid white. The only difference is
the pigment in it is black rather than white. And it allows you to create some beautiful, beautiful effects. Alright, let's start today. Let's use phthalo blue. It's a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you're at. And phthalo blue is just such
a beautiful, beautiful color. It's a warm, warm blue. And let's go right up in here making our little x's and crisscross-y strokes. And let's just put in a
happy, little sky here. Just, just one that's a lot of fun. There. Something like so. That's all there is to it. But make these little crisscross strokes. It blends better and it leaves
little actions in your sky that looks like there's
beautiful things happening very, very easily. There. And this truly is the
lazy man's way to paint. There. We work with big brushes and fantastic colors we try to make painting
as simple as possible. But yet to look like, to
look like a real painting. Alright, a little more of that blue color. Maybe, right in here. We'll just, we'll just tap. I'm just going to tap in some basic little cloud shapes. There. Something about like so. We'll just let our
imagination take us wherever we want to go today. Just all kinds of little shapes and forms up here in the sky. Because on this piece of canvas
you truly are the creator. You can make any illusion that you desire. Alright I'm gonna take a little, this is a very soft blending brush, and I'm gonna begin blending this. Working with it. Just playing. Having fun. Alright, I'm gonna blend this
out till it's very, very soft. Very gentle. And this brush, as I mentioned
earlier, is very soft. Very, very soft. You can blend right over color without disturbing it too much. Alright. Put a little color right on that brush. I'm just using still phthalo blue. That's all. And we'll just put in all
kinds of little indications. There. And I'm using just the corner
at times just to blend it, to sort of stir it up, to mix it up. Try different effects cause as you know, we don't make any mistakes. We just have happy accidents. So anything that happens here you can work with it. You really and truly can work with it. There. Something about like that. So we're just creating
all kind of illusions. And you decide how many
clouds live in your world or how few. Maybe you don't want any clouds. That's okay too. Cause you can do anything that
you desire on this canvas. There. Alright. And down in here where we
begin to touch the black. We'll just begin blending color together, here and there, we'll take a little white. Just a little titanium white
right on the same brush. And begin blending in
some pretty little areas right in there. Still using just the blender brush. See there, it creates a
whole different plain there, right there in the sky, just by putting a little white on there. Make some beautiful effects. This liquid black can
do great things for you, especially in areas where you know there's going to be a lot of dark color. Or if you want to grey a painting. Traditionally, painters use a lot of grey. This will do it automatically for you. Automatically. Let go wherever you want
some little light areas, just drop them in. A little white. There. Isn't that something that you
can create a sky like that in just a matter of a minute or two? You can do it! You can do it. There. And this is a nice sky if you
want to put rays of light, it would be very easy to do. I don't think we'll do that today but it'd be very easy. Practice doing some
little things like that and see what kind of effects you get. There take a little blue and
firm that cloud up a little. Right in there. Just make that cloud a little stronger. Alright. (brush strokes) Something about like so. And that's really where
that liquid black in there and liquid white. That's really about all we need. Something about like that. You have to decide where- how far down it comes. Okay, let's wash the brush. That's the fun part. Little blender brush is
not as much fun to wash as a big two inch brush but it's not bad. (tapping) Eh, it didn't slash as far. Tell you what, I got a
dirty two inch brush here just so we can get even with
the crew, I'll wash it too. Alright, that's better. That's much better. A lot more fun. Now let's take us a little fan brush. I'm gonna use... I'm gonna use a number three fan brush. Take a little white, little bit of the, little bit of the blue maybe a touch of crimson in it. Oh, nice color. Nice color. I like that. Little more blue, darken
up just a wee bit more. There. Nice color. Maybe a wee back here in the background, maybe there lives just
a happy little mountain. Let's see if that's dark
enough to stand out. We just want it to stand out from the sky. That's far way. Far, far away. Little bump right there. See there? That's all there is to it. Want this to be a quiet,
quiet, little mountain. Just barely can see him. There. Something about like so. And that's all we're looking for. Gonna highlight that a little bit. And I'll continue to use a fan brush. Let me wash it off. Good enough. We'll take a little bit
of the titanium white and just load a little
onto the fan brush... like so. Once again, this is
number three fan brush, but you can use a number six. Whatever. It doesn't matter. Just want to highlight that a little... so it stands out. Alright. See how easy that is? Gives the impression of a little mountain that's far, far away. I spend a lot of time in Japan. And in Japan, there's a lot
of paintings of Mt. Fuji that look similar to this. Of course, this doesn't
look like Mt. Fuji, but I mean painted this way. And it's a super, super way of doing it. It's very simple. Even if you've never painted a mountain, this is very easy. You can do that. See? Maybe there's a little
doo-der right there. It's up to you, up to
you, where you want them. But I want this one to be so far way that you can't see any detail. Just that there's a mountain that lives way back in the distance. Alright. Now then let's have some fun. Let's take our ol' two inch brush. Since we have the black
up here, liquid black, we don't need to put
some dark color in first like we normally would. Normally, we would put dark color in. So I'm just gonna take a
little bit of sap green little of the yellows... mix them together... and just mix them all
together on the brush. That way you get layers of color within the bristles. You couldn't do this
intentionally if you tried. Let the brush work. Okay, let's go up in here. Now maybe, right back here. The base of our mountain,
we can begin to see just some little things that
grow right up the side here, about like that. See there? That's all there is to it. Just follow the angles in the mountain. And we'll push that mountain way far away. Little bit of bright red adding in too. Just to get, oh ya. Little too much. There. Just to flavor it. Just to flavor it. Little more color. But see, it's picking up that liquid black that's under there. And it greys all the colors. Makes them look very soft, very muted. Creates wonderful effects. There. But you could make hills and valleys, little plains, meadows, anything
that you want back here. Your world, you can
create anything illusion that makes you happy. There we go. Just put the least little
touch of paint thinner on the brush. If you have trouble making the paint stick add the least little
touch of paint thinner. There we go. Begin thinking about the lay of the land, how it flows, how it curves in here. Because that's very simple to do and it, it makes your painting special. There. Something about like so. Wherever. Tell you what. You know me I love trees and I think this is a good place to- let's have a tree. Let me find another fan brush. There's a fan- Let's take some midnight black, prussian blue, prussian
blue is much stronger, maybe a little van dyke, little
crimson, little sap green. All the dark colors basically. Just mix them together like that. But it should look very
dark, almost black. If you put a little white with it you see it has a blue base. But it should look black on the palette. Let's take our fan brush loaded full of color both sides. Both sides. Alright. Let's go up in here and have some fun. Maybe back here in our world, there's a little stand of trees, live right in here. This is a very, very easy way of making the indication of a lot of trees. Load the brush till its very sharp goes to a chiseled edge. See there? It looks like individual little trees that just hide back here somewhere. And decide where they, how
far down the hill they go. There. Okay, we got to decide how
far up the hill they go. You have to make all these big decisions when you have power. There. Alright. Now we have a whole stand of trees. Group of them. Maybe, I tell you what, maybe far away right back in here, you can see the indication of
some that live far, far away. These aren't as dark and they're not as distinct. So wait till your brush
is almost out of paint and then do those. Then do those little rascals. Now we can go back. Let me find a, here's a clean brush. I want to lift upward, that will just smooth the paint out and make it sort of fit together. Back to my little brush that has our sap green and all the yellows on it. Load a little more color. Little more color. And let's go right in here Then you decide where the
bottom of the stand of trees is and you just sort of cut it off. Didn't know you had so much power did you? You really can do this. You can move mountains,
trees, mighty rivers. This would be a good place
to put a little river. There. As you paint you begin to see things. Don't worry about what you're gonna paint. Just start painting. Have a general idea in your mind. All you need to know is the time of day and the time of year. You need to know the time of year. So you know whether there's snow or whether it's springtime. That's all you really have to know. Just have a basic idea in your mind. Take off. Go. Do it. Alright. Yeah, I'm gonna put a
big tree right there. This is your bravery test. I like big trees. A lot of paint on the brush. A lot of paint. Let's go right up in here. You ready? How about right there. Big tree. I mean that's a big tree. Let's do a little push up tree today, where we push the little branches upward. In some parts of the country evergreens grow with branches that lift up and in other parts they hang down. it just sort of depends
on where you happen to be. And you can do them either
way that you want them. It's up to you. We just want to show you
as many ways as possible to create effects and then you do it however you want. Cause painting is a very individual thing, as I've mentioned over
and over on this show. Each of us, each and every one of us, will see nature through different eyes and that's what you are to paint is what you see and the way you see it. Art is an expression of self. Express yourself. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. The only rule that I adhere to in painting is that it should make you
happy and you should enjoy it. If you comply with that rule,
than how could you go wrong? There. Well that is a big tree. I tell you what, let me
mix up a little more paint. I think he needs a friend. You know me. I think everybody needs a friend. Same colors again. I don't want that ol' tree to get lonely. Let's give him a little
friend that lives right here, right there, just like so. Here he comes. Ain't this liquid black neat though? Once again, if you have
paintings that in your mind you thing is gonna be a lot of dark areas or you just want to grey the
overall tone of the painting, the liquid black will do wonderful, wonderful things for you that are very difficult to do without it. It takes a lot of work to do what it will do automatically, basically. Now then, let's take a little dark sienna, a little van dyke, a little
white, we'll mix it together, get a little roll of paint. Let's put the indication here and there of little tree trunk. You won't see all of it
so don't worry about it. Just here and there. Just here and there. We'll take a little bit of that tree color and mix it with the yellows and instantly we'll have green. And with that a little bit more. There, now make this
quite dark, quite dark. Evergreens are pretty dark in value. Alright now we can go right along in here and let's just put in a few highlights. Let's do the little tree. I think that trees in the background. So we'll do it first. And then we'll come back, change the flavor, change the color just a wee bit. And let's go right up in
here and put some highlights on this little tree. We don't want him left out. But just push upward. Think about where the limbs
and branches would live. Just drop them in. Don't get all the dark. I know sometimes it gets feeling good. (grunts satisfyingly) And you just don't want to stop. I get letters all the time saying I covered up my entire evergreen tree. Leave a lot of dark in the evergreen. Lot of dark. There, darker, darker,
down toward the base. And that should happen automatically because your brush is
picking up this dark color and you're running out of paint. It should automatically get
darker down toward the base. Let the natural action of
the brush and everything work for you. Let's take a little it
of this green color. And, oh, I know, I know. Oh, I see it! I see it. I'm gonna take a little brown. Excuse me, I get excited. I see things happening in here. Take a little brown, little
black, mix it together, little white. There. Alright, let's go. We said there could be a river there. I think in my world, today, I'm gonna have a little, maybe a little path, just goes right back through there. We just take the fan brush and drop it in. That easy. We don't know where it goes. Don't care. Now back to my two inch brush, add the grassy colors on it, and maybe, see? There it is! Maybe, maybe put a little
liquid white on there. I'm gonna brighten the color
and thin it at the same time. The liquid white will
brighten the color see? Little bit brighter. Now just using the corner of
the brush, just the corner. That's all you need. Darker, darker, darker. Alright, maybe over in here. Every once in while I'm
adding a little bright red maybe, see? There you go. That come right out from behind the tree. You just make the decision. You decide where these little plains live. You can just... I'm sorry I get excited because there's so many things you can
create and you can see in your painting as you work with this. There. My son Steve. Boy, he's a dynamite painter and he's so young and he
gets so excited over this. It's nice to see young people get excited over something like this. He's 27 years old. And he's been painting since he was 12. He sold his first painting when he was 12. I don't think he's ever worked again. He found out that painting can be fun and he can make a happy
buck or two off of it. Alright. See you can just create layer
after layer after layer. But it's picking up the
black that's on the canvas. And it will grey everything automatically. Makes a very nice effect. Let's go back to our little fan brush where we were making a path. Maybe this ol' path just
sneaks right around here. There it comes. There it comes. See there? You can have it just go anywhere you want. But that's just a grey
color on top so it shows. You can sort of give it a bend like that to make it look like it's recessed, or any way you want to. Absolutely anyway that you want to. Now maybe, over here on
this side we need something. Let's have another tree or two. Another little tree. There. Okay, just give it a little upward push. Something about like so. Just decide where a little tree lives. Drop it in. Drop him in. There we go. Now you can make any
kind of tree you want. Maybe you want a tree that- maybe you want a maple tree here. That's okay. You decide. You decide. I'm gonna put another one right there. Oh, right over my little mountain. Well, you could have a little
naked spot on your tree. So you can still see
some of your mountain. Those trees don't always grow perfect. They're like us people. We have some faults. At least a few. That tree reminds me of
my little squirrel Peapod that you've seen so many times. That would be a perfect
place for him to live. (chuckles) In fact today I've got
him in my pocket here. It was a little chilly when
we were filming the show so I left him at home and I
brought his little cartoon, equal here. Isn't he a mess? That's Peapod the pocket squirrel. There, we finally turned
him into a cartoon. He became so popular, especially
with my young friends, that we've actually made a
cartoon out of that rascal. There we are. A few little highlights on there. Let's have some fun. Let's take... I'm gonna take some black. Just plain, ol', midnight black, maybe a little van dyke brown in it. And I'm going to thin it
down with paint thinner. I'm going to make it very, very thin. Just put paint thinner in it. And, we'll make some big stones. Then we'll take some white and mix with a little bit of that. So we have two different values and we've got the same basic color only one of them has white in it. And that way we can have
a highlight and a shadow. Let me grab a little
black and put it in there. Oh ya. That looks good. But the paint is very thin. Very thin. We'll take our little oval brush. I'm going to load both
sides with the dark, lot of dark color. Once again this is very thin. One side and one side only through the light color. Maybe we go out here (swoosh) And maybe there some big ol'
stones that live out here. You decide. You decide where they live. Shoot maybe, right here at
the base of this ol' tree there's a stone or two. And you can put these things
anywhere you want them. Just like that. (grunts satisfyingly) It's a neat way to make a stone, isn't it? You can make the highlight and the shadow all in one stroke. Then we put some little grassy
areas right around here. Something about like so. But that easy. You can do unbelievable things. Maybe, we got a second left here. Maybe you want to change your mind. See this tree here? Let's bring it all the
way down to the bottom so it's in the foreground. It's that easy. You can do it. Put a little highlight on it. And that easy. You pull that tree right
here into the foreground. Shoot, I think we 'bout
have a finished painting. This liquid black is wonderful. I hope you try it. And if you have time take a photograph of your work send it to us. We'd love to see what you're doing. We'll sign this one and call it done. There. With that, we have a finished painting. And from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. (smooth jazz music)
