hi I'm glad you could join me today you know in the past we had a young artist on the show that was so fantastic we got so many cards and letters talking about how great this young man was we've decided to bring him back and today it's my absolute pleasure to introduce you to my son Steve and Steve hood little devil can paint he travels all over the country and he teaches literally hundreds of people the joy of painting and I've asked him to come here today and show you what he can do in just a couple of minutes so Steve if you chill how to do a fantastic little painting I'll get off here and I'll see you at the end of the show okay thanks a lot dad one of them try to do today is a waterfall scene and all of a few different things that that I usually don't put in like a bushy tree over on this side and a birch tree over on this side and like I said before they'll probably be a huge waterfall right down here in front so one must start out with is a little bit of phthalo blue in the sky and I'm just going to smash that straight down into the brush try to get a nice even distribution and if you want a real dark sky you're going to need to use a lot of paint and of course if you like the more light soft subdued sky then you just use very little and kind of a salt pressure but I like the dark shape so I'm going to try to put a lot of pressure on it and generally when I load the brush I always will go right up into a corner and start there and then work into the center and as you do that the brush picks up the liquid of white and gets a lighter the sky gets lighter automatically towards the center of the painting and that's what you're looking for so I'll just throw in something like that and then maybe I'll go into a little bit of phthalo blue and phthalo green just a small amount of that phthalo green and down here in the water we'll just put some straight horizontal strokes in now I'll come back with a clean dry brush and try to blend all this out save on that light source in the center at least a little bit if I can mainly what I'm trying to do here is just add pressure on the areas where the dark and the light come together when you get through blending your sky you really shouldn't be able to see where the light stops and the dark begins so you should end up with something similar to that and then down here on the water you just make your straight horizontal strokes I'm trying to save a little bit of that light there too okay maybe and this one will have a mountain so what you want to do is get your palette knife and mix a few colors together van Dyck Brown oppression blue and maybe just a little bit of a lizard and crimson too with that sort of looking for a dark purple mix that up real good then come up to the canvas and maybe right here start in with a real rough rugged mountain shape and you want to be careful not to get too wild because if you get your mountain too large about the only thing you can do is nail another canvas on top of this want to start over but say you didn't like a part on it like right here you could just make it a little bit bigger so it's your first mountain I'd recommend starting off with kind of a small one and then making it bigger and bigger until you like it now once I get the shape and I'm going to try to straight most of that paint away and come back with my big brush and pull that right out want to be careful not to get too close to those top edges okay and then maybe a little snow just using titanium white picking up a little on the knife like this and just right on top of those edges closest to the Sun really light pressure you and right over here maybe just a little bit kind of like a glacier formation or something and when when you go in for your shadows you'd want to use white with a little bit of pression blue it's a real simple shadow color and kind of leave the paint marbled a little bit where you can see some of those dark blue streaks in there and remember a shadow is a reflection of the high light so you'd want to have it break over here just like it did on the other side so use real light pressure and maybe even the small blade on the knife every once in a while if you're working in a real tight area right here kind of pull down with the contour the mountain if the mountain didn't go straight across then you would want to pull it you know down at that same angle if you see the dark line on the back of the mountain coming down like this that's the same way you want to make the shadow so I'd come over like this a little and then draw most important is leaving your dark areas you'll notice that I harp on that through the entire painting on every single step we do I'll say always leave those darker is there it takes dark to show light okay and then down at the very bottom of your Mountain you can use your big brush and just make a little bit of mist just by tapping up into it and then kind of lift get rid of those tap marks okay now let's say we wanted a few foothills in there maybe we'd use some SAP green and some Van Dyck Brown together get the yuckiest green color you can get out of this because you know how trees in the distance look real dark and and kind of sappy that's why we call it SAP green okay and then mix them white with that all we're looking for here is a couple different values of green real dark green and maybe just to drop a paint thinner okay just come up here with a brush and touch real lightly it doesn't take much pressure right here it's mostly just the shapes you're looking for and don't be afraid to run over the bottom of that mountain but I wouldn't recommend coming up too much higher than I did because you want to save just a little bit of that mist back in there makes the mountain look more distant okay and once you throw in a nice little hilly shape you come back in with a clean draw one-inch brush and lift that up and these will be your little trees in the distance I was just recently in Pennsylvania doing some classes and this is about all you see out there in Pennsylvania as these rolling hills it's a big change from Indiana now down at the bottom of your Foothill you'd want to mist it out by taking your big brush and use the tip of your big brush and smash in until you get that mess the reason I said use the tip of the brush is because we use the side you seem to get a straight line of mist across here instead of a variation you got to be careful about little things like that and maybe I'd want to make some roads coming in front of that one so I just add a little bit more of the brown and SAP green to that same color and say this one comes down in front of that one just make it happen as long as you work from back to front through the entire painting you really can't go wrong but you never want to put in three or four foot hills at a time and then go back because when you were blending the bottom of this one you might come in and go whoops and hit the top of that one if you weren't real careful but we can fix anything so we're not really worried about it okay let's take a little bit of real dark this time just pure SAP green and Van Dyck Brown and put one more row right in here making sure we save some of that mess though and notice how the incline of the land lessens as you come forward my mountain was real high and bold and that first row of foothills was kind of kind of high and rolling and now this next row is just sort of flat that gives the illusion that this is real far away just going through my same steps over and over again notice what I'm making this mist I'm really pounded in hard you have to get tough of these brushes they're so big you have to convince them to do the right thing okay now maybe we'll go for a well of dark foliage up front thin like brown and SAP green just like before that'll be our mother color for the rest of the painting we'll be using that to put our dark shadows in for everything now what I'm doing is just pulling the brush through the paint and coming up and just smashing it right in there so even if you've never painted before this is really simple to do because no matter which way you twist or turn the brush it's always going to come out looking good and kind of make this drop a little bit on the right-hand side so it looks more like a round leg up front and then I'll take my big brush pull some reflections down go across see and now I'll throw some land in with Van Dyck Brown one more time on the knife first you just start off by touching real lightly and then you pull to the left hand side kind of making little Hills here too real flat ones though and a little bit of brown and white for highlights could even throw some dark scene or something in there if you wanted to bright red works nice for that too and of course every time you have something above the water you have to pull a reflection out of it and go across that one also now say I wanted to come in and put some colors on this foliage back here I'd probably use a little bit of green first because you do see a lot more green in nature than any other color so a little bit of SAP green with cadmium yellow makes kind of a nice light green color yellowish green on this part you use lots of paint on the brush but just barely touch to get that crystal a effect and you can start changing your colors around can use any of your three yellows and maybe as I get out to the corners I'd want a little bit more subdued color so I'd start adding more green and more red that gives the impression the sunlight shining right down in the center more there a little bit of liquid white on the knife and just kind of smear it in on the palate like this and then wipe your knife off and cut right across that just like that trying to get a little bit just on the very blade into the blade now when you do that the role of liquid White's going to look like it's on the top of your knife but it's actually right on the very end of it and that's about the only way I've found to get a good amount of paint on there and remember water lines have to be straight even when you're coming around the bend still water always lies flat okay let's see down here choose a little bit of phthalo blue and a little bit of pression blue together and see what kind of color we get out of that now this is on the big brush and I'm just going to start out by coming up here and pulling out a big shape pull it out one big blue shape this will be the start of our waterfall smooth this out and back about a little bit here okay I'm going to use my fan brush with liquid white and titanium wine on it and just throw in about six separate strokes here okay this will be the first one and each individual one kind of overlaps the next just a tiny bit and you do need to use plenty of liquid white for this it's kind of hard to get that paint to flow on there just right and it's really not a good idea to go back over your strokes again little bit of movement in the water and back of it here okay now since that waterfall just kind of sitting out in the middle of nowhere let's bring in some clips from the sides make it look like some banks got washed away you have to use plenty of Van Dyke Brown for this part right here and you just kind of smear it on in sort of a C shape if you notice that I'm kind of making it like a overhanging cliff shape so you just fill that whole area in over there and then over here you do the same thing make sure you cover up enough at the waterfall go on the sides okay and then some more Van Dyck brown and white together for highlights on top of that just like the bit in the background and just grab on top of each shape and pull right across and automatically you got the top of your cliff and you just kind of decide where you want them and then sometimes the neat effect is to take a clean knife and push up into it and pull down and that really starts making it look like a cliff okay now say we wanted a little foolish around these cliffs that's easy enough we're just going to kind of smash it in there like we did before in the background maybe a bush here some grass down here you know whatever just whatever you see in your mind's eye that's the way you want to put it on the canvas I might need a little bit of dark blue shadow down here too that way when I go in with my splashes and stuff we'll have some real dark underground there to look good this is how you do those splashes you just run your fan brush through the white hit it on your palate a couple times to open up those bristles and then come right up here and start firing it in kind of make some sound effects while you're doing this to some splashing sound effects that helps a lot okay maybe I'll come back in here and highlight this foliage now getting into some brighter colors up here in the foreground you know the sun's out real bright today and maybe it hit even harder up here in the front on the left-hand side putting in this foliage is probably the easiest part of this whole technique you just throw it right in there and leave enough dark shapes and it just comes out like you like it and maybe I'll show you how to do one big tree using that same bushy idea and we'll stick it right over here now don't forget to leave some places for the birds to sit you got to leave some open areas on your tree here and just bring that right down maybe with the knife and some Van Dyck Brown a little trunk now you don't need to get real detailed on these trunks because most of its going to be covered up anyway it's a little bit of that Van Dyck Brown of white again to highlight that and for some reason they always look better with a few little sticks in there that goes for everywhere and your folds and everything okay and how about a nice bright color some cadmium yellow and some bright red with it makes a real nice orange you can certainly tell what season this is all these leaves changing colors and maybe a bush to cover up his feet and usually on this painting I like to put a nylon down here just to break things up a little bit just on this one side and of course you need to bring a little bit of grass down on that too well other than a couple more little grassy things I think this one's about done probably call that finished okay well you understand now why this young man is in such demand as a teacher and why I'm so proud of him he's a fantastic painter and once again I'm proud to call him my son and Steve thanks for being with us today thanks - and we look forward to seeing you again happy painting and god bless Oh Oh ha you
