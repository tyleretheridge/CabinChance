- Welcome back. I have my little friend
Falcy here again today. We've got so many cards and so many people have called in wanted to know about this little devil. Thought I'd show him again. This little rascal is just absolutely gorgeous. He's a Kestrel. Look at him. Isn't that something? See if he'll eat a little something here. There you go. See you were given a
little bit of beef heart. And that's what you'll
have for lunch today. Got a little more? Mhmm. There. He is absolutely precious. Some places I mentioned
earlier they call him Sparrow Hawk. But he's just gorgeous. Let's see if we can make his wings go up so you can see how he looks. He's a little baby. There. He's just learning to fly. Alright. And you notice I have a big glove on here. He has some claws that
are absolutely unreal. Alright. Then I guess we'll set him
down here in just a second. Tell you what, while I'm setting him down, let's have him run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint
along with us today. And while they're doing that, why don't you come up
here and let me show you what I've got done already. I have my standard old 18x24 inch canvas. And we've today took
and made a little oval out of contact paper or
any haze it back paper and we've put that on. And just got it stuck real good. And then we've covered the entire canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white. So it's all wet and slick and ready to go. So now we can take off and we can just have fun. Alright. (brush clacking) Let's start out today. Maybe we'd just have a happy little scene. Something that gives a feeling of desert. I'm gonna start with a small amount of the Indian Yellow. Just a tiny little bit. And maybe go right up in here and just use little criss cross strokes. It'll just drop in some yellow color. Right along there. Something like that. And without cleaning the brush, I'm gonna go right into a little of the yellow ochre. Sort of a golden color. Very nice beautiful little color. I think you'll like that one. So we have just a little bit of the gold color right above the Indian Yellow. Okay. Now then once again
without cleaning the brush, I'm gonna go into a small amount of Alizarin Crimson. Doesn't take much, just a little. It will go right up above that and just drop in a little crimson. Still using the little exes
or the criss cross strokes. Whatever you wanna call them. There. So we can take it all the way to the top. It doesn't matter. Wherever we want it. Something like that. Ok and we just blend this till you can't tell where one color stops the next color starts. And might be right down there, I know what we'll do. Let's take some crimson, the crimson and a little bit of the Phthalo Blue. Just mix together a little crimson, a little Phthalo Blue, makes sort of a lavender color. Okay let's go back up in here. Maybe our horizon's gonna be right below center here. We'll take a little of that lavender color and just sorta, lift it in one direction like that. Just sort of pull it. Sort of curve it upward. There. And you can even tap and make the indication of some little, little stringy clouds. Just going right on along. Something like that. And down there we just
clean the brush off. Doesn't much matter down there. Let me wash my old brush. That's the fun part. That's the fun part. Shake off the excess. (laughing) And just beat the devil out of it. Now with a clean dry brush, I wanna gently start here and blend this. Like so. And the rest of it we'll
just blend a little bit to take out some brush strokes. Now then. Let's mix up a little more
of that lavender color. I wanna take Like we'll have some fun. I'm gonna take some Phthalo blue and Alizarin crimson and mix it together. Proportionately. Much much more crimson than blue. I need a bigger pile. There. Might as well mix up some. Ok. Something about like that. Let me clean the old knife off. Now then I'll just grab a, we'll use a fan brush today, what the heck. Put a little bit of that
color on the fan brush. And maybe we got some big old clouds that live right up in here. So we're gonna make a stroke that's. I'm exaggerating. Let me really exaggerate. It looks like that, only smaller and not quite as much angle. But that'll give you an exaggeration, an exaggerated view of what it is. There. Just sort of overlap all
these little strokes. Like that. Sort of like you're doing an ocean. And maybe there's a little lure, hangs out around here. Sometimes It's nice just to make maybe very lightly there's a little fluffer
cloud that just floats around here. Little fluffy one. Okay. Let me grab a clean dry. Be sure it's dry. Two inch brush. And then I'm just gonna
blend that cloud right in. Watch here, look. Just blend the bottom of it right out. So it just sorta, just sorta blends right
into the background except for the top edges. Cause I want this little
cloud to be very quiet and subdued. He's just sort of hiding back here. And then we can take, and in the foreground, then, we can put another little cloud. And it'll look distinctly
like it's in the foreground. That's the reason I wanted
to blend that one back. There. And who knows maybe over here there's even a couple
little stringer clouds that hang out over in this area. Just sorta let you imagination take you wherever you wanna go. Enjoy. Painting should make you happy. If it does nothing else,
should make you happy. Alright. Clean dry two inch brush once again. And let's begin blending the little clouds we made here. Another thing that painting will do. It'll make you see and appreciate nature. Everyday, every single day I receive letters from people who would say that if painting had done
nothing else for them, it's made them appreciate
some of God's creations. I never will forget, I got a letter from a lady one time. Told me she had lived with
a tree in her front yard for 25 years. And until she started painting, she had never actually seen it. She'd looked at it. Over and over she'd looked at it. But she had never seen it. And painting will make you see things in a whole different light. There. See how you can just make it look like a big old mean cloud laying up there? That easy. Okay. Good. Let's wash that one. I just like to wash brushes. We use odorless thinner. Odorless paint thinner. Shake off the excess. And cover the whole room. And that's really a nice way to redecorate your whole house. You can do it in about a heartbeat if you beat the brush like that in your living room. You're certainly gonna
become very unpopular if you do it. And I suggest you get your
little brush beater rack. Let's take, we use that same little lavender color. Maybe I put a touch more blue in it, get it to the blue hue. Or the blue side of lavender. Maybe we're gonna have like a
little deserty type scene. Maybe way back in here there's maybe just a little mountain that lives. I'll just use the corner of the fan brush. And just sort of pull it downward. Can you see how, what's happening there? I sort of pull it downward. Make all those beautiful
little shapes and designs that you have on some of those fantastic mountains out there. Arizona, New Mexico, all the way down into Old Mexico. I've been spending a little time in Old Mexico here lately. Oh my God is that gorgeous. That is so beautiful. We recently did a show where we went to the floating gardens and painted right outside of Mexico city. It's one of the most gorgeous sights you've ever seen. If you get a chance, you oughta see that. Whew! I never knew it existed. But I'm certainly going back. There we are. And we just sort of bring
it right on down here. There. And let it work out. This one's far, far away. We don't want a lot of detail in it yet. Don't want a lot of detail. Let me grab a, let me grab, what to use a two inch brush. What the heck. Grab that and pull it. Just pull it. There we are. So it all blends right into the painting. Sure hope you like that little bird. That little Kestrel is one
of the neatest little birds. But I'm not kidding. You certainly have to wear
gloves when you work with him. That son of a gun has some talons on him it's unreal. Even though he's small. And that one's, that one was just a baby. He still can get you. And I borrowed him from Diana Schafer, the bird lady here in Muncy. There. And she'll raise him till
he's just a little bit older. He needs another couple of months. And then she'll release him. And let him go back and start his own family. Because there, they're a very protected bird so we have to take care of them. Let's have some fun today. Let me clean off a little spot to work. I'm gonna make a nice green and brown, green and crimson mixture, I mean. Alizeran crimson and Sap Green. Let's just mix them together. And I really wanna mix this thoroughly. Cause I wanna make a beautiful,
beautiful brown color. This makes one of the nicest browns. But you have to mix it pretty good. Normally we leave our paints marbled. But in this case, I want to mix it up quite well. Proportionately, it's about equal. About equal. Let me wipe off the old knife here. Now we can take a two inch brush. Just put a little of that
beautiful brown color right on the brush. Okay? And let's just begin applying some of it right in here. Very lightly at first cause these things get
closer to you in a landscape, they should get darker
and darker in value. So back here we just wanna, a light brown color. I don't want it to get
too carried away yet. Darker and darker as it comes forward. And to make it darker of course, all you have to do is
add a little more paint. There. Okay. Down here toward the base. Little bit darker even yet. But already, just about
that difference in values, it'll give you the indication that it's going further
and further away from you. That's what helps create
the illusion of distance in your painting. There. Alright. So right on back. But isn't that neat how that works and causes you to have
the feeling of distance? I tell you what, let's get crazy today. Let's get crazy. Maybe there's a big old stone right there. I like to do big old stones. Show you an easy way to do it. We use that same brown color. Use the knife. Pull it out flat, cut across, Get a little roll of paint. And that little roll of paint should live right on
the edge of the knife. Okay, let's go up here. And maybe, I don't know. Maybe we got a big old stone that's right there. And just begin with a basic shape. There. Grab a little more paint. There, see? But just decide how this old stone looks and how it was formed. It's up to you. If you look around, you can find a stone just about any shape that you want it. Just about any shape. Alright. Okay, a little bit down in here. And all we're doing is
just blocking the center. We're filling it up full of color. Ok, maybe there's a little
projection back here too, I don't care. Just whatever. As I say, stones can be about any old color we want them to be. Okay. There. Now then, let's take, let's take, We'll use some bright red, little bit of that brown we made and mix it together. Get a little white. There, they're some of
the most beautiful colors in the desert. So you can go really
wild with your palette. Let me wipe off the old knife. You can go crazy with your knife. I mean with color when you're doing desert scenes. Cut off a little roll of paint. And no pressure, absolutely no pressure. Just like we're doing a mountain. Mountain is only a stone that has grown up. Just barely touch. Just let it graze down there. There, here comes, now watch. Look at all those little
things just happening and you could turn the knife. There we go. But just barely. Barely graze the canvas. Barely graze the canvas. There, hmm. And the paint breaks. In other words, It has all those little holes there, little openings. And that's what really
makes it outstanding. Outstanding. There. Come right on down through there. Something like that. I don't know. However you want your stone to be. Rough and ragged looking. It's had a hard life out here. There we go. I'm gonna leave that quite dark in there so it'll look like a recessed area. Little creatures gotta have a place to get in there and hide too. We gotta take care of them. Gotta take care of them. They're my friends. There. Ok, we'll just make that old stone come right on out here. Something like so. And just keep on to this little patch of rocks here will take over your whole painting. And that's ok. That's ok. There we go. Take a tiny little bit of that color. We'll make this one a little flatter. So we'll just put a little something on the top only. And you take the knife, let me get a little color here. Just pull down. Allowing at least little
touch of that color you have on top to come downward. It'll create the illusion of a nice sharp edge right there. And maybe then we'll bring this one right on down and through. So it would've pushed that one back. It's just playing games. Painting is nothing but games of illusion. There we go. As I say, I really hope you
liked seeing that little bird. I have always my whole life, enjoyed little critters. I never will forget when I was very young, I worked at a big department store close to Orlando Florida
where I was raised. And instead of paying me off in money, they paid me off in creatures. And they told me I could take
whatever kind of creature I wanted that they had in the store. And back in those days
they used to still sell alligators in Florida. And there was a little alligator in there about two feet long. So I told the store manager, Well I want that alligator. Now everything was fine till I got home. And I remember I went into the living room. I must've been about 12, 13 years old. And I had that old
alligator in a cloth bag and I dropped him out on the floor. And my mother just about came unglued. I thought she was gonna kill me. But we finally made peace and she allowed me to
keep the little alligator. But he never was one of her more popular pets around the house. Cause he tried to bite me the day I got him. And he tried to bite me
the day I let him loose, which was about, must've been close to a year later. And I turned him loose in
one of the lakes in Orlando. Now he's probably ten feet long. There we go. Just gonna pull the base
of this out a little bit. Just let it blend outward. Ok, good. But I don't think an alligator
makes a very good pet. I don't believe you can
tame one in 50 years. He's always gonna be a pretty mean old critter. But they're not near as dangerous as you think they are. I'll tell you what we must do, let's have some fun. Maybe, maybe, you know me and maybe. Maybe there's a little, little path goes out behind this rock and just sorta comes forward. And I'm making a little motion like that. I'm exaggerating. But so it looks like this path has been wore down. And this may have been animals that travel up and down this path in front of this old rock. Or it might have been people. I don't know. Maybe back in the old
days the old wagon train came in this direction. There we are. Maybe it's just a nice place for the little coyote to go. I don't know. Make up little stories, though. And we'll blend the
light color back into it just by pulling it in one direction. Just to bring it back together. So it sorta sets down in there. Now we can go all the way across, very gently, Two hairs and some air. There. Maybe there's a , maybe there's a little weed that's right there. Push upward with a, with a fan brush. Just a happy little bush. There. Ok, now we'll take another little fan brush. Little bit of that lighter dirt color. Just grab the bottom of it, pull it out a little. So it fits right in there. There we go. Now, liner brush, we'll use that. Little paint thinner. Go into that same old brown color. Maybe there's an old gnarly
bush that lives there. I don't know, I haven't spent a great deal of time around the deserts, but maybe this is, maybe this is gonna be a future tumbleweed or something. I remember tumbleweeds from when I was young and used to listen
to the cowboy shows. And they were always talking
about the tumbleweeds going across the desert. That was back in the days when we used to listen to shows on radio, before TV was invented or before it was popular enough for people in my neighborhood to have one. There. I would never tell anybody but I used to listen to some of the shows and it'd be sad
at the end and I'd cry and I'd threaten my brother
if he told anybody at school that I got sobby-eyed
over some of these things. I think he told everybody. And he's a policeman
today and bigger than me so guess I won't hassle him too much. Alright. I'll take a little bit of the, little bit of the liquid white, a little bit of that
same brown color into it. Okay. Let me clean the knife. So I have a very thin paint. Then I'll take old filbert brush. A little bit of the brown on both sides. Ok, down here now. Just stay there, i'll find you. There. Pull one side through that. I have dark and light. Okay, maybe there's just a little stone or two. Lives right out in here. So you can just put a little happy little stone here and there. There, maybe over here on this side there lives a little stone. Wherever you think they should be. But by loading the fan, or the hilbert brush,
both sides like that, you can double load the brush and these little rascals are so easy. So easy. Just pull a little bit of
that base color into it so that just blends right together. I'll tell you what I must do. I'm gonna take the, the sticky back paper here off. And let's see what we have. This is what they call
the moment of truth. Right here. And then if you wanna
get crazy, (chuckling) and you know me, always keep you satisfied, have to do one more little thing. Let me just, quickly here mix up a
little more of that brown. Sap Green, Alizarin crimson. Just mix it together. Alright. Okay. Maybe outside of our oval, just to break it up a little bit. Maybe there's a, maybe there's a little
cactus living out here. I don't know. Maybe it's an old cactus and he lives right there. Big old strong cactus. And we'll make him, make his little top here round. There, no square cactus. They seem to bother people. Alright. Just fill him in. Let's give him an arm. You always think about cactuses having an arm hanging out. At least one. Maybe, maybe this one's got two. Who knows. You put as many arms on
your cactus as you want. And down here, maybe there's just gonna be
some little bushes down here. I don't know. We'll have a little place for him to sit. So it don't look like he's
just hanging out there. We'll take a little bit of, let's take a little white, a little midnight black mixed together. Make a nice sort of gray, maybe put a little bit
of that brown in there. Oh, that's nice. Cut off a little tiny roll of paint. And we go up here. And just begin touching. Just touch the edge. I wanna make it look like
there's little ridges. Cactus have ridges. There we go. See? Just by touching the canvas. Just touch it. The canvas will take off what it wants and give you back what's left. There you go. Ok now maybe this arm is on this side and the other arm is on the other side. You have to make that decision. So that's what we'll decide in our world. Let me get the little knife. I'm gonna get a little
knife for doing these smaller places. It's hard to make a round cacti with a square knife but we can do it. Cause we can do anything. As long as we believe we can. And we believe we can do that. A little bit on the other side. Shoot. Not too bad looking old cacti. And we can even take a, I'm gonna put a little
touch of the sap green on the other side so when you look close, you'll see a little greenish hue. But I want him to be mostly silhouetted. Just a little tiny bit of green. Ooh, oh that's good. Just a little here and there. Not too much. Ok, good. Hope you can see that there is some green in there. You know what, I don't want a great deal in there. Now let's take a little bit of brown and white. Make it look like a little soil right down there. Something like that. Take a fan brush. Use a little Yellow Ochre, a little bit of that brown mixed together. Just go up in here and pop in a few little highlights around the foot of that little cactus. There. Hope this gives you an idea of how you can make some
super little paintings very, very easy. Cause it's a lot of fun and you'll enjoy this one. I'm gonna take a little, the brown with the liner brush. And maybe there's old weed or two growing around the bottom. Might even be an old stick. Just sort of whatever you want. There. Shoot, I think we got have a finished painting. So say, hope you give this one a try. You'll enjoy it. And from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God Bless, my friend. (light jazz music)
