hi hey welcome back certainly glad you could join us today I thought today maybe we'd do a very nice little seascape I've got a lot of letters from people asking me for a simple little seascape that anyone can do so I thought we'd do that today let's start out and hammer on all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us while they're doing that let me show you what I've got done up here for this I have my standard old canvas I use an 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched double-prime canvas but you use whatever size you want I took a piece of contact paper and cut an oval out now to cut the oval out you can use something like an exacto knife or a pair of scissors it doesn't matter stuck the oval onto the canvas covered the inside with black gesso just totally covered it with black gesso allowed that to dry completely now on top of that on the sky up here I've taken Prussian blue and black I think I'll make a stormy looking sea today so I want something very dark and very moody just Prussian blue and black and covered the entire top on the bottom I've used a little bit of black SAP green and Prussian blue so on the bottom I just put a little bit of SAP green otherwise it's the same as the top so you could do the whole thing add a little SAP green at the bottom just to give it a little watery feel and with that let's just start off and have some fun take off the day with the old two-inch brush and a little bit just a small amount of titanium white we don't need much paint not much just a little just old titanium white and let's go right up in here and now with that let's just put in some basic little little cloud things that are happening up here and I'm just using the corner of the brush and just making like little little X's just sort of let the brush play and just have fun up here so it takes very little paint though very little because we have the color underneath when you touch it with white that color comes alive just absolutely comes alive there and we just sort of have to thank and make up in our mind where where does our big old clouds with he's a big old fluffy mm little tough cloud storm clouds maybe and we just sort of dance them in here and there they're in here wherever you think they should be there seems very very easy to do this very easy maybe there's another big old cloud that lives right here you can tap in a few use just the corner making X's any way that you sort of get an effect that you're looking for there then we're going to come back and we're going to blend all of these so even these areas that a very dark will end up with a little bit of paint in this black canvases are so fantastic because it allows you to make effects that are there but they're almost done real easy to do it very easy to do there we go maybe a little color right in here and then let me wash the old brush if you payed with me before you know that's really the fun part of this whole technique is just washing the brush so we'll scrub the old brush with odorless paint tenure shake off the excess and just beat the devil out of it now be sure your brushes as dry as you can get it and then we can go up here and very lightly just begin blending this now you can blend it to any degree of darkness that you want in other words the more that you blend it it's going to mix with the color that's already on the canvas and it'll get darker and darker and darker you could always go back and add a little more of the white and we may do that just to highlight some of the clouds so don't worry about it as you know we don't make mistakes we just have happy accidents and by that we just mean dit they're very soon you begin to to be able to work with anything it happens anything it happens and you can turn it into something that's exciting and wonderful there's nothing bad that happens on this canvas the absolute worst thing it could happen is it you take the pain off that you put on reuse the canvas and do the painting over but even then you've still learned and anytime that you learn from practice it's not wasted alright I just use the same old brush I want I want to add a little more white I think we're going to brighten up our clouds a little and as I say in your world you make them as bright or as dull as you want up to you up to you depending on the mood that you want they're just the corner of your brush and just little tiny things like that see there for the purposes of TV I think maybe will make them a little bit brighter so you can see them better but maybe when you do yours you just want very quiet little gentle clouds I have several brushes here will grab another one that's nice and clean and dry so I can just blend that out a little there we go maybe yep you're right we'll do this one here a little bit too this is one of the simplest easiest ways that I have ever found to make very effective little clouds and it works that's what's so important it works there but just think about little things that are floating around here in the clouds you just just put them in just put them in I'm going back to the clean brush like that and very lightly just blend it a little just blend it look I don't want to blend it too much don't want it to go away there and you can do this as a say as many times as you desire some people want clouds that are very distinct it's easy to do you just do this as many times as you want till it gets their turn gets the room morning mmm class a mean-looking old cloud there that's when the more clouds are to bring your thunderstorm in a heartbeat all right I live in Florida right close to Mickey Mouse's house and we have a lot of thunderstorms sometimes especially in this summer is a there's a period there where almost every day we have a fantastic thunderstorm I sort of like them because it's it has a beautiful sound to it and when it's over everything is clean and fresh beautiful again it's like God sort of washes the whole landscape there okay with that easy we have a pretty nice little sky some nice clouds no problem at all and as I say even if you've never painted this is one that you can do now here I had just a piece of old masking tape because it it helps me have a nice straight line across there that's only reason I have it on there so we'll just take it off and we have a very straight horizon now and with that we can begin to really play let me wash the brush I just been a while just like to wash it there we go we're in business now now then we had that piece of tape might need to add just a little bit of color so we'll take a little SAP green and black blue and we'll just bring that color right right up there something I can't I know you probably can't see that because I can't either but we know now that there's paint all the way up to that line all right madam let's use the old filbert brush a little bit put a little bit of titanium white on it and let's just sort of lay out our basic way you've shaped this is one of the easiest ways that I've ever found to sort of lay out your wave so you know where it's going to go just take a little paint because it doesn't matter anything you don't like you can just wipe it out and lay out a basic wave shape here maybe the old wave comes over like it goes off and back in here back in here there's a another old wave wherever you want them and back in here we'll just have little ones see in that wave will crash over in that direction that helped we just sort of put a little flying in there so it it helps you see how the water is going to go but that easy yeah watch the old filbert brush yep I'm going to grab maybe today I use a number three fan brush sometimes I use a three sometimes a six whatever happens to be available doesn't matter doesn't matter having a little bit of white paint on it pick up a little touch of blue and put in there up there all right now then let's start we back in here and just touch and let me exaggerate I'm doing a rocking motion think about water to do to do doop like that now I'm really exaggerating because I'm doing it very small something about like so see there and automatically that'll begin to create the illusion of little things that are happening back there alright that this is going to be our wave just taking goes right across like it there it's why we have paint on the brush we'll bring this right on down over like that all right now then wipe all the excess paint you can get off the brush or you could even wash it to start with a fresh brush now then I want to take this color that we put right on the edge here and begin blending it back very gently very lightly just begin blending it back trying to preserve a dark area right in there just try to preserve that that's your good friend see there and those dark areas will end up being he waves become something about like that it will come back with the liner brush and we'll put all kinds of little details in there but this is just a extremely extremely simple way of making a very effective little wave very effective Cal seascape sometimes can give you they can give you a little problem or two they're not the easiest thing in the world of paint so we try to simplify it to where anybody can do it even on their first attempt I'm going to take a little the CAD yellow a little bit of white just mix it on the filbert brush right there I can't get let's go up in here now everybody likes to have this wave where the lights coming through some people call that to I of the wave so we'll take this and scrub it in just really get in there and scrub video Jen's really work it let it just get darker darker as it works out like yet okay that's really not all there is to it and you can make this as bright as you want it the same as you did the clouds by just cleaning the brush going back and adding more and more color now that will take a very clean dry brush and using just the tippy-top bristles I'm just going to wiggle it I'm really wiggling the handle more than I am the bristle see the handle is going around round but the bristles stay right there can you see that good there and that's all we're doing and you can turn this into it's so smooth it's almost unbelievable and then just work outward outward out there I don't want this to get too bright in this particular painting because in my world I think this is a this is sort of like a storm coming it's getting pretty rough out here so there wouldn't be a great deal of light coming through here but if you want to have more please please feel free to do it we're not trying to teach you to copy here are only trying to teach you a technique and and turn you loose on the world because as I've said before we all see nature through different eyes and we all have different interpretations of what things look like and that may truly may truly be the joy of painting is that you do your thing you paint your world the way that you see it in the way that you want it on canvas there because art is a very very individual thing we all have different ideas of what we want and they're all good there's no good or bad it's just does it make you happy I have still number three fan brush since it was handy and dirty load it with a white paint with now that this is the fun part let's think about the water just crashing over to make little sounds just make a little sound seat there there it comes just think about how it crashes over this a wave has traveled a long way it finally got here to shore and that's crashing over its gonna create a lot of foam makes a beautiful sound beautiful sail there something about like it is all we need for now and would take a filbert brush take a little bit of blank a little bit of the Prussian blue and a touch of white there we go so making sort of a put some lizard crimson there to want it to be more of a oh that's nice more of a lavender type color but lavender to the blue side okay let's go up in here now then we'll take this brush and let's put a shadow we're putting the shadow in first for the phone there it comes waters turning and crashing and churning always just having a ball back here hmm there all right I have two filbert brushes going here so I can sort of work back and forth without having to stop and clean them each time they're not as much fun to clean as the big brushes so we'll just we'll have a couple of them something about like n-now then we can go right up to the top of that shadow and we can put the indication in here of some some nice foam each time you load your brush wipe it off get it nice and clean or at least wipe off the excess paint then go back and reload it there wiping it a little bit more paint then we can come back with fresh paint and just keep right on the splashing here just sort of tapers off into nothing shoot ah we get that maybe there's maybe back in here some little splashes that are happening this is pretty rough water so we need some little some little doers that are going on back in here who knows who knows maybe there's even a a little bit in here not as much not as strong because we want the center of interest to still be in here there now good dry two-inch brush or you could use a one-inch brush for this if you're a little more comfortable with it makes no difference and once again we want to blend this together so it's as soft to silk just like so there something about like it and I beat the brush just to knock off excess paint and sometimes in our world take a little Van Dyke Brown little a little bit of the dark Sienna maybe my little black mixing together maybe in our world we back we we back in the background let's go up here maybe there's a little headland up here you know just a little projection of land comes out into the water something about like so it's very dark it's very far away but we can still make it out back here and take a little bit of light but in there to make a little highlight same color I'm just add a little white to it so here and there we can see just a little indication of things that are going on there like that now we have to watch the rain brush go back to our white paint pick up a little and I'm gonna just just splash a little water right up here in this headland there something about like so maybe you can even see a little here and there see it's really splashing right there maybe there's some big rocks in the water we don't know just makes it very interesting and very pretty Aven going back to the old filbert uh I like the old filbert today doesn't matter use anything and we can begin putting in the indication here all kinds of little foam patterns and this water is churning pretty hard here so we're gonna have a lot of little things that are going on there this is where you really bring you a little seascape together all these little things that are happening there we go so I say this is a very very simple little seascape this is what I'd recommend when you first start and as you work father and father you can do seascapes that my gosh you won't even believe but this is a good way to get started to get a feel for it she has to get a feel for it there we go we have so many fantastic people all over the country that are painting their painting scenes that they never believed possible and maybe more interesting is their family and friends didn't believe they could ever do it that's nice when I've got letters from from young friends Mother's it said my son or daughter is painting and they're doing paintings that I can't hardly believe and they've never had any lessons other than watching this show on television and from that they become very interested in art they began to experience a little success and as you probably know nothing in the world breeds success like success so if you have a few good experiences with painting in you then you sort of get hooked on it so try these paintings that aren't too difficult at first become comfortable with them and then as you become comfortable go into more difficult things I've taken a little bit of paint thinner mixed it with some titanium white a little bit of the Prussian blue have a liner brush very thin paint fill the bristles full let's go up in here now we can come back and begin putting the icing on the cake you can just put all these little things in here this is what gives you your painting character looks like a lot of detail in it and if you have time you can set and do this and make all kinds of gorgeous effects gorgeous gorgeous effects and this is really what will make your seascape special very very special there let's say they're just little things that are happening or the water splashing and playing and having fun but we're using that same stroke sort of a rocking stroke now you have sort of a weird angle here and it looks a little strange but it'll look right for you by the weird angle I mean the camera gives it a little angle this looks a little higher than it really is all right and we can bring things all down through here but details in in the water there as you paint more and more seascapes spend more time studying foam patterns I've maybe the hardest part of painting seascapes these little foam patterns here though are what make or break a seascape these are just dropped in very easily but as you paint more you'll want to put more and more detail into there we go you can get carried away with this and just make some of the most gorgeous scenes there maybe something about my cab sometimes it's nice to take the LEAs little touch of that white we head with a little bit of yellow in it and thin it down then it down a little paint thinner and you come back and just highlight that's just it's just to make it Sparkle a little don't overdo this is too dark of a painting for this to be real bright now then also another thing that can be done that's very easy and old filbert here that's half clean you can take that dark color some blue and black little green and you can come back up in here with a filbert and you can literally just punch holes in the foam see can just punch holes in wherever you think this should be so it looks like yours openings in there so if you get a little a little more foam pattern here than you want just go back and punch a hole here and there that's all that's all no big deal as I said earlier we don't make mistakes we just have happy accidents now then I'm gonna take the contact paper off and let's see what we have here so this is the moment of truth let's just grab it pull it off so and that doesn't make too bad of a little seascape for your first time or if you're just beginning to paint it's a nice little seascape but you know me I don't ever leave well enough alone so tell you what let's do let's take a little black a little bit of the Van Dyke Brown mix it together here and maybe in our world shoot that's too nice to leave alone I got to have a big tree that lives right there be brave this is your bravery test after you've worked so hard to create a beautiful little seascape then this crazy guy tells you to drag a tree right through it you know what's worse the only thing worse than one tree is two trees so let's be brave let's be brave because we can do anything in the name on this piece of canvas anything little sap green red into that same color I will put a little base color in here I need something for my little trees to set on they're sort of just hanging out here in space so same color with little SAP green in it just to give it some dark so our Lydell chill let's take I'll use that little fan brush and take it the dark Sienna in it and black but mostly black I want this to be sort of a gray color with just an indication of a little dark Sienna now we can just go up here and touch give it sort of a little round pull just touch don't want this to be too bright cuz we have a pretty dark sky here early old dark sky just enough there show a little indication of light on this old tree that's how we sort of separate them but when you do this pull it sort of round by round I mean like at and it once again I'm exaggerating but it'll give the tree sort of a round effect okay so easy that is and then let's take some paint thinner and I'm gonna go right into the midnight black I want a lot of black color but I want it to be very very thin very thin because you know our golden rule a thin paint will stick to a thick paint I've got paint all the way up half we have to handle the brush here but that's alright so alright but the paint is very thin and maybe there's some old palm leaves laying out here and blowing in the wind this is the easiest way have ever found out of making them just use a very thin paint figure out basically where you want them to be and then just give them a little pull something like so there what old palm trees had a rough time Annie there where I live there's a lot of palm trees they're gorgeous gorgeous trees I like him there maybe that's just a little rascals hanging up here he's trying to make it win sort of blowing him around today but he's doing all right we'll have a big one out here maybe he goes clean off the canvas who knows it's your world so you make it any way you want it another one out here there's another one coming out through here out through there wherever these are gonna be mainly silhouettes mainly so little SAP green little white in here and there you can just put the indication of a little I don't much it's gonna burn that illusion of darkness all right grab another fan brush take a little yellow little SAP green put it right in here pretty dark and let's put some little grassy areas down here two-foot pretty dark green color a little book dark Sienna in it once in a while just do like yet we can take a liner brush a little bit of color put in a few little little things that hang like yet just to bring it together and I think we have a nice little seascape done it's very simple I hope you tried because this one will work for me from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and cut bless my friend [Music] you [Music]
