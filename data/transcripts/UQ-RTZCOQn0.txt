- Welcome back. Awful glad you could join me today. Today I thought we'd do
a beautiful little scene on a black canvas such and I think you'll really enjoy it. So I'm gonna have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this fantastic painting and they'll come across in the same order that I have them on my palette, starting with the white and working around. Let's go up to the canvas now. I've already covered
the entire canvas with a thin even coat of Thalo Blue and Alizarin Crimson together and much more crimson than blue, I want it to be sort of a purplish color. And I've covered the entire canvas, then brushed in long horizontal
and vertical strokes. The paint is wet and it's ready to go. So let's take off, we'll start with a little
bit of Titanium White and let's put a light source
in this little painting and maybe it's right there. Now see when you touch it with the white it begins picking up a
beautiful purplish color that's underneath. And all these fantastic things, they just sorta happen. Don't have to worry about them, just let them happen. And you blend out. If this is gonna be your lightest area, then you blend out in sort of like a half circle. Now you can make this area
as light as you want it. But each time, I'd recommend
you clean your brush and start with a clean, dry brush. There we go. Start with a clean, dry brush and clean white. And go back to this light area and begin blending outward, each time, though once again, I'd clean the brush. Otherwise, you're gonna drag that dirty color back into the center. Alrighty, just keep working out, out and out. And it gives you a nice super little sky. Then you can just blend
out the brush strokes. Okay, and one more time
I'll clean the brush. This is just odorless paint thinner. I had a lady in class one time that let her brush go and it went clean across the room. Blip! Okay, let's take some Alizarin Crimson and Thalo Blue, still using purple, and we'll just mix that up, more crimson than blue. Blue is many times more
strong than the crimson is. Okay, now I'm just gonna
get a small roll of paint and let's go right up here. Maybe there's a happy little cloud that just sort of floats around. We'll just touch the canvas, just touch, I'm just allying this paint to pull right off the
knife onto the canvas. Maybe it comes wherever you want to go. Just a happy little cloud. Then it'll get a little
smaller in the background, that way it looks like it's farther away. With a large brush, very lightly, very lightly just blend it. Just blend it. Okay this is three hairs and some air. Okay now then, maybe let's put a little
highlight on this. Take some Titanium White, add a little bit of Thalo Blue into it. There we are. Okay, a little bit of paint on the knife. Now since our light source is here, Let's just let a little light
strike right on the bottom of some of these clouds. Just let them happen, let it happen. Yup, that easy. Okay and just lay these on the canvas. Now, with our large brush, very lightly, once again, same angle, most important, just blend it back and forth, now you can blend this until
it absolutely goes away and leaves you. So stop. It gets to be fun and you have a tendency just to keep going, you don't want to stop. But get it to where you want it and leave it alone. Okay, I'll go right back
into that same purple color and tell you what, let's build a happy little mountain and it lives right there. Just let him go and I'm really pushing here, I wanna push this paint
right into the fabric. Right into the fabric, maybe there's a little bump right there. Really, really push this
paint into the fabric. Okay with our large brush, we'll grab that and just pull it down. This removes excess paint and also it's a good way to
sort of lay out your general mountain shape. These brushstrokes will show up on, especially on a black canvas. And you can literally, just
by changing brush stokes, you can lay out your entire mountain and have an idea of how you want to put the highlights and the shadows, and just by doing that you can change it. Super, super way to lay it out and get it just right before you ever put your first touch
of paint on the canvas. And let's just use this
Thalo Blue and white, that'll be our highlight color today. This Thalo Blue, Titanium White. Okay, pull it out, get a small roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife, right on the edge. Okay let's go up to the canvas here. Now, barely touch, you're gonna just follow
right down the side of the mountain. No pressure, allow that paint to break. Allow it to break, just like that. Think where the light would strike it. Think where it would strike. You want those areas to have the lightest, brightest color. See, at the same time, it's picking up some of
that purple undercover and all these beautiful
things just happen, you don't have to worry them. You don't have to worry. Make an almighty mountain here today. Okay, maybe here is a
little bit right there. Right there, maybe it just sort of plays around, wherever you want it to go. Wherever. Now for the shadow side, I'll just mix some purple, that was the Alizarin
Crimson and Thalo Blue, and a little bit of light color. Just to make a light purple, and we'll use that for shadow. Cut right along in here, then we can drop in some
happy little shadows. Okay, maybe it comes right down like that. And we'll just sort of blend
these together right here. There's nothing wrong with going back and picking up a little of this blue, just sort of playing it back and forth, let all these beautiful little things just sorta happen, just fall off your knife. There we go. Okay, mix me up a little more of a highlight, that's the Thalo Blue and white. Look at there. Did you ever think you could make a mountain that easy that was that effective? And you could just keep adding more and more detail. It's almost unbelievable what you can create with just a big old knife. And a little bit of practice, you really need to practice. There we go. Okay, we'll just drop a little shadow over in here, not get carried away and cover up the whole canvas with just mountains, which is an excellent,
excellent way to practice. When I was learning, that's what I used to do, I'd cover a whole canvas with nothing but mountains and scrape them off and do it again. Very quickly, you learn
how to paint mountains. Okay now I'm gonna take just a clean dry brush and I wanna create some mist down here so following these angles, gently tap. But always follow the angles that you have in the mountain. There, just gently, gently tap it. And your brush is picking
up some of this color and all these beautiful
things just happen. There, now we lift upward and that takes out your little tap marks and blends it all together and creates a beautiful,
beautiful misty effect. Just like so. Okay now then maybe we'll mix up some more crimson and Thalo Blue, we'll just keep using
some of this purplish color here. Okay, there good dark
color should look black. Should look black. And if you wanna tell
exactly what your color is, put a little bit of white on your palette and touch a little of that color to it because otherwise you really can't tell, it just looks black on here. Now I'm gonna load a fan brush up, let's go up to the canvas, maybe there's some happy little trees that live right here in front of this almighty mountain. Just touching. I want these to be very dark so they stand out
against the lighter color on the mountain. Dark against light, light against dark. Continually, continually. Trees grow to all different sizes, all different shapes. You have to make these decisions how do trees grow in your world? And then let them go. Let them go. Okay let's go over here a little bit. Right there. Just let these trees shoot wherever you want them to go, maybe they just come right
on across the canvas. But you can see how easy they are just to drop in. And you just decide
how many trees you want in your world, put them in. And don't fiddle with them, don't worry about them. You're the master, you can do anything. Now then, maybe let's put a little grassy area down here. I'll go right into a little bit of Cad Yellow, Sap Green, we'll just use this old big brush today. You can do it with a fan brush, one inch brush, whatever. Maybe right here, we'll just touch. Just barely, barely touch. I wanna make the indication of just a little grass playing back here with the sun shining through. There we go. Maybe it comes right on over. And I'm just tapping the canvas. Add a little Yellow Ochre,
a little Indian Yellow. Just break it up a little. Okay. And as your painting, look at your painting, continually look at it, step back and look at it, and you can see all kinds of things. A lot of times I'll start out with one painting in mind, and by the time I'm finished, I've totally changed my mind and it doesn't look anything like what I had in mind when I started. And that's the joy of painting. Okay, fan brush, some Van Dyke Brown, a little Burnt Umber, just mix them on the brush here. And let's put in what will eventually end up being some land under here. And I'm just gonna scrub
in just a little color. Probably very hard to see on your screen, but it's there. Maybe it comes out right through there, it'll show up in a minute. Just gonna scrub it on. Okay then I'll go right
into a little bit of... let's try some Yellow Ochre, we'll drop a few little highlights here and there. Don't want too many, just a few. Oh there we go, all kinds of nice little things. Now back to our large brush, and we can tap a little
bit of grass right on top of that and it will very quickly
bring it all together. I'll show you a little trick, it's a lot of fun. I'm gonna put a small
amount of Titanium White on my fan brush, and I wanna make it look like little tree trunk indications. So grab and just very lightly, just here and there, just lift upward a little bit. Just here and there. Not a lot, not a lot. If you get more than you want, just take a clean fan brush and go back over it. The dark color will come right through and it'll make it go away. And that easy you can make an indication of little tree trunks and you really haven't
hardly done a thing. Okay, let's have some fun. Let's have some water in here. I'm gonna use Titanium White and Thalo Blue, and I'm gonna make a beautiful, beautiful bright sparkling blue here. There we go, pull it out very flat, and go right across so you have a small amount of paint right
on the end of the knife. Okay good, let's go right up here. Now then, let's begin, oh look how that shows up, look how it shows up, just barely touching the canvas here. I want it to look like
a happy little stream just bubbling along there. Just having fun, so I'm just barely, barely stroking the canvas. And keep these, keep the lines here. Basically straight because water's level, it's always trying to go
somewhere where it can be level. There we go. Let it go there. And you can put as many of these in as you want or as few, whatever. Okay see there? That easy, that easy. You got a little bit of water. Tell you what, maybe this water, maybe there's a stone there. Maybe it just falls right over it, get a little blue and
white on my brush here. There we go. Load a lot of paint into the bristles, okay let's go up here. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, gotta make a decision. There it comes and choof. See there? Just let it fall right over. Maybe just right there. Maybe, maybe, maybe, it comes over here and drops this way. This is your world so you have to make these decisions. You can see that purple is
beginning to come through. The more you rub it, the more the purple that's underneath comes through. And beautiful things happen, almost automatically. Almost automatically. Okay, add a little more blue in there. Boy, that's pretty. Thalo Blue is such a vibrant blue. Okay maybe I'm gonna add a little bit more right in here to darken it and the water comes right over and when it hits down here, you're gonna get all these beautiful little splashes that are happening. And it helps to make sounds so you feel the power of the water. Okay now we need to
have something in there to contain that water, we don't want it to just sneak out. So I'll take a little bit of the brown, it's just Van Dyke Brown, and maybe there's a land mass that lives right here, right here, whatever. Good. And we'll go right into some purple, we'll just use that same purple color. Maybe on this land mass there lives a happy little evergreen tree. There it is. But just sort of make up little stories in your mind, this little tree lives here and he watches the stream all day. It makes him happy, so he grows and gets strong. There. Just make up little stories and they make you happy. When you make up these little stories, then you can visualize
these things in your mind. There we go. Tell you what, I'm gonna grab another fan brush and we'll just put some trunks and then some highlights. I'll just use a little
bit of this blue and white that we used in the water. But a few little trunk
indications here and there, all I'm doing is touching
the canvas here and there, just touching. We're not sure how many trees are there, however many you want. Sap Green and some yellow, I'm gonna add a tiniest
little bit of paint thinner to that. Let's put some brown in, it's too bright. I wanna dull it. Oh there we go, there we go. Sap Green, Cad Yellow, little bit of Van Dyke
Brown to dull it down. And we'll just put some little indications of some leaves here and there, don't want too many. There we go. Little bit over there. While I got this going on the brush, I'll just add some Yellow Ochre and Indian Yellow. I'll just put some little grassy things right there. This is the Yellow Ochre, make some dirt. I'm gonna add a little
Burnt Umber to that. Yellow Ochre and Burnt Umber, oh that's pretty, that's pretty. There. Now we can take, that's just a little blue and white, clean up those edges, and start bringing all this together. Now maybe right there, shoot, we're having so much fun making all these big rocks. And this is still brown and a little purple. Maybe there's a big old stone that lives right there. Right there and he comes right down. There we go. This little fan brush makes beautiful stones. There we go. Now, we need, let's have some of this little grassy area coming right down the top of the stone. Just flapping the top down a little bit. And a little bit of
umber and Yellow Ochre, a little bit of top on that stone. And just here and there, give a least little indication, pull a little bit down, and then with a clean fan brush, we can just pull that right in. It'll help define your stones. Keep this area very, very dark. Very dark. Okay, now we need something on the other side over here. Tell you what, let's go right back into
this purple and brown, whatever dark color, and we'll put a evergreen
that lives right there. Just let him fall off your brush. Okay and there he goes. Just right on down the canvas, big, big evergreen. Big evergreen. Okay, we'll just put a couple over here because I don't wanna lose all this nice mountain area. I like that mountain. These big strong mountains. Okay maybe right out through there. Let's put a nice stone there, this is just brown and a little Burnt Umber and we'll make another nice stone that lives out here. Okay, little tree trunk
indications right in this big tree over here. Just some indications, don't need too much detail. And then some highlights and some little leaves showing. Yellow, Sap Green. Okay little bit right here, just like so, a little on this tree. And while we got this brush running, we'll come right down there. That's some nice little grassy things that are just traveling
right down this hill. We'll make some little stones. Add a little more of
the Burnt Umber there. Maybe right out on here. We'll make those decisions later. Later, later. Okay little bit of grass right down there. Isn't it fantastic? That easy you can make all these beautiful little rocks. Okay let's work on some water. I'm still using the Thalo Blue and white, I'm gonna add a least little touch of Magic White to it just to thin it down a little. And let's go right in here. And now we can begin playing, with all these little swirls and churning actions. Just to let your mind go. Think how the water would hit and splash and play. There. And here and there, there's little stones under there that cause it to go choo. See, gotta make those little sounds again. And what started out as
a soft little stream, it fell over the big stone here and turned into a little bubbler. Okay, now then, let's take...there it is and bring our stones right on down wherever we want. A little grass here and there on them. Just let them play. Here we're just pushing
with a fan brush to make all these happy little grass things. Okay, tell you what, it just looks like the right place, let's have right here in the corner, we'll cover up our nice tree, I want a nice big tree
that lives right there. This is Van Dyke Brown, we need a nice little foot on this tree, big foot on this tree. There we go. He's gotta be strong standing. Okay, now then, I'll take a little
permanent red and white, gonna add a little bit
of Burnt Umber into that, there we go. Now let's put a least little touch of highlight here and there. Don't want a great deal, just enough to make it shine. Just here and there. Let it come right on down his foot, his little foots need some highlight. Now on the other side, I'm gonna use just a little
Thalo Blue and white, quite dark, give us indication of reflected light. It sorta makes it stand out. Okay, let's put a little
bit of grass down here around his foots. We surely just about have
a finished painting here. I wanna put just an indication of an old limb hanging out here. And I think we'll call this one finished. And I really hope you've enjoyed it, it's a lot of fun, it's a beautiful painting. Until next time, happy painting. (relaxing music)
