- Oh, welcome back. I'm glad you could join me today. And today I have a special treat for you. I have a close personal friend that's gonna paint for you today. And he comes out of Muncie, Indiana. I'd like to introduce you to Dana Jester. And Dana travels all over
the country teaching for us, and I think you'll find
him a fantastic painter. So, Dana, thanks for being here. I'm gonna turn it over to you and I'll see you at the end of the show.
- Thanks a lot, Bob. Okay. Today what I've done, I've got the canvas
prepared ahead of time. I've got a coat of magic
white up here on the top. And I've used the magic
black on the bottom. The base, only magic black down here. And the colors we'll be using today you'll be seeing soon
across your screen here. And what I'm going to
use first is thalo blue and we're going to paint in
a little sky across here. We just use this 'x' pattern across, just across the top just like so. And we'll gradually blend
this in using our magic white, since it makes a nice base coat. And we'll let it gradually lighten up (swishing) as we work our way down to maybe where the horizon line's gonna be on this painting. (swishing) Just like so. (swishing) Okay. We'll go ahead and
clean our large brush here. (slapping) (tapping) And I think maybe we'd better on this painting here, we'll use the fan brush. And we'll load it up
with some titanium white. Load up fairly heavy. That way you'll get
the brush to work right for you with these clouds. We use the brush in a
circular motion, like this. You don't have to put
the same amount of clouds in your painting as what I'll put in mine. You can always design your own. Use your own imagination. Just put a few floating
little clouds in here. Something like that. We'll go ahead and clean our brush. And we'll go back over these clouds with a large brush. Kind of soften 'em down. Set 'em into the sky a little bit. Look at that. (swishing) Just go back and forth on 'em. (swishing) Something like that. (tapping) And I think maybe what
we'll do next is take, we're going to work with equal parts of alizarin crimson and thalo green. This should make a black. But in order to test this color, we need to mix a little bit of it in with some of your titanium white. (scraping) Make sure you get this thoroughly mixed. (scraping) If not, you'll be in trouble. Okay. Take a little bit
of your titanium white, you end up with a black, nice dark gray. So we're gonna go ahead and use this with some more titanium white. We'll use this for the base
coat of your mountains. (scraping) We'll put some mountains
in this painting today. I think a majority of
people like mountains. (scraping) Okay let's work with a
little bit darker value, especially if you haven't
painted too many mountain scenes, if you get a real dark base coat it'll be a lot easier for you. Okay let's go up to the canvas and put us a peak in, just like so. (scraping) Just drag this paint down. (scraping) Scrape it right on into the canvas. You can make as many peaks as you desire. Whatever you like. (scraping) It's best to avoid getting a straight edge down here at the base of your mountain. We just wanna (scraping) get this scraped in for now. The magic white will work
for you in a few minutes. (scraping) Just like that. (scraping) Okay. Go ahead and clean your knife off. Make sure you got all the
excess paint off that mountain. But what we're gonna do is start working with some highlight color. We're just gonna use titanium white. Roll it up on your knife like that. And get a nice fine roll and go up to the right
hand side of your mountain and just let this glide
down right off the knife. We'll do it again here. Just like so. Just let it glide and break. If not, this mountain'll
not set back for you. And we'll start here on this peak again. Light's suggested from the right hand side of your painting. Just like that. Maybe run this ridge right on over. This is how you develop
several different ridges in a mountain. (scraping) Just let her flow off your knife. (scraping) Just like that. Okay, now what we're gonna work with next will be some titanium white and just a small amount of your thalo blue because that stuff I tell
you, is really strong. It really'll overpower
that white real quick. Just want a nice soft (scraping) real light blue. And we'll use it just the
same as we did your white. Only we're gonna put it on the
left hand side of your peaks for the shadow. Just fill in your little dark areas there. Go back and fill in all
the left hand sides here. This is where you develop
your own mountain. (scraping) Wherever you see a little ravine, that's where you need to put your shadowed area in. (scraping) Just like so. Okay. Now let's take a large brush and soften this base of this mountain down quite a bit. You can pull this paint down all the... (swishing) Usually it's best to follow
the contour of the mountain. It'll help the lay of
the mountain real well. If you just pull straight up and down, the mountain looks like it's just standing up on the canvas. You don't want that to happen. (swishing) You want that to drag right on out. (swishing) But if you didn't have that
magic white underneath here, it sure would be a problem. (swishing) And see how nice and misty and hazy it is, the base of that mountain? That's what you're looking for. And you can go up here and pull just a little of this white down. Nice and easy. (swishing) Now at this time, we'll go ahead and work
with the knife again. And we'll drag just a
little more highlights down. Maybe, maybe we want this to come down just a little further in just a few areas. That'll really help set it back
just a little bit more also. (scraping) Don't get too carried away. Where you have light,
you'll need some shadows. Keep that in mind also. Okay, let's go with our knife and we'll put in maybe a little bit more shadow area right in here. (scraping) Just like that. Okay. Now we can soften that down using a large brush again. And see how much more
distance you're creating when you put just a little
more white down there. Just like that. (swishing) Just like so. (swishing) Okay. Let's work with the fan brush next. What we're gonna want to do is go with the fan brush, and pick up quite a bit of your dark mix that we mixed up earlier. And we're going to use this to put in a few fir trees back
here off into the distance. So we'll go up here and start. Just use your fan brush, just use the chiseled edge of it. Just tap down and pull these trees down. And it's also a real nice idea if you can vary the heighth in them trees. You don't want to have
them all the same size. (tapping) Looks a little more
realistic if you can do that. Don't forget to put quite a
bit of paint on your brush. (tapping) Especially when you're first starting out along this edge, and as you work toward the
center of your painting, let's just let the
paint flow off the brush and use the magic white to
lighten this up in value. That'll set it off, even a little bit more
off into the distance. Just like so. See how those are starting to fade off into the distance. Look at that. That's just right. Right on over to nothing. Okay. Let's go ahead and
clean that fan brush out. (dripping) Maybe we'll work with an inch-brush next. I think maybe, take the inch brush, and we'll just tap and soften
this down a little bit. (tapping) This will give the illusion of more fog or mist here at the
base of these trees, that'll set 'em, help set
'em back into the painting. (tapping) Maybe give it just a little more depth as you work across the canvas. Also it don't hurt at
this time to maybe pull in and follow the contour of the land here at the base of your trees. (swishing) We'll go back to our fan brush. And what we're going to do
with the fan brush again is just load it up real
heavy with your dark mix and we'll put in a few
more distinctive fir trees. A little larger, right here. Just use the corner of your brush and just let them fir trees
fall right out of the brush. Just like that. (tapping) Just tap it right on down. Just like so. That was so fun, let's do another one. He can't stay there all by himself. Just tap him right in there. Look at that thing grow. (tapping) You can pull it right on down to the land. You don't want 'em floating. Getting carried away. I gotta put one more. Maybe he's leaning just a little bit. This is just a baby tree, here. (tapping) Okay. Let's go ahead
and clean our fan brush. (dripping) Maybe we'll get some land for those fir trees to sit on. And we'll go back with our inch brush. And we'll just tap down just a little bit to create a little more
distance in the painting. (tapping) Something like that. Now let's go back with the old fan brush. A little bit of black, not much. We just want to tap and press and lift. to create just a little
land underneath here. (tapping) Just like that. then we'll go back and
maybe soften this up just a little bit more
with a one-inch brush. (tapping) Even pull some of this down. (swishing) Kind of taper that land off
like it's a rolling hill. Gotta have a few little rolling
hills around this mountain. You don't it to be lonely there. Okay. Let's go ahead and
go back with our inch brush and just soften this
down, just a little bit, just by tapping down. (tapping) That way you'll have a
few dark areas in there. (tapping) Soften it up. (swishing) Just like that. Better clean that inch brush out here. And I think maybe it
would be a good time to take the fan brush out again. And let's put in a few trunk lines with some of this dark mix. And again on this. If your paint's very thick, you may wanna add just a little thinner for the paint to flow off
your brush for these trees. And these trees will be nice and tall. Maybe we'll take it all the way off the top of the canvas here. Just come down just like that. Just like that. (swishing) Don't forget to take plenty
of paint on your brush to put these trees in. Okay. Let's try that again. That was so much fun
we better try it again. Let's go ahead and put in another one right in here. Just like that. Just let her come on down
into your foreground here. You don't want to let it
stand there in midair. I'll go maybe one more time or just a couple more times. You never know. Just depending on the mood of the brush. Just like so. (swishing) Just remember to put plenty
of paint on your brush when you're doing this. And pull it down. Okay, I think there's a little ole, maybe this next trees a little lazy and I think he looks like he might be leaning over just a little bit. Look at that. Yeah, he's lazy for sure. Plenty of paint. (tapping) Just like that. Remember to take him
down into the foreground. And while we got the brush loaded, let's pick up a little
thinner on that brush and go with this dark mix. Make sure it's a little on the thin side. And we can always tap in just a few little pines on this side. Maybe there's another fir tree growing over here on this side. Just like that. Okay. Now before we get too carried away on tapping, you know,
pines on the other trees, let's take a liner brush and some thin oil or your thinner, and put in a few branches on these. Just drag 'em right off there. Load your brush up and make
sure that paint's good and thin or it won't flow for you. Get some thinner on that brush and drag them right on out like so. Just like that. Maybe these other trees need a few branches on them. (swishing) Just like that. Remember, make sure that
paint's good and thin or it won't flow off for you. You can also get a little carried away with putting too many
branches on these trees. But you've got to have enough to make it a little realistic there. And it helps if your arm, or your hand can get real nervous to make those branches kinda wiggly there like Mother Nature creates them. Something like that. Need another one down in there. Gotta have a friend every now and then. Won't hurt if you take one clear off the side of the canvas. Okay. Let's go back to the fan brush. Make sure your paint's
thinned down a little bit. You can use a little bit of your thinner. Use this dark value just
to tap in, just tap. I'm really just using the
corner of my brush now. Just tap in a little bit of pines here. Just like that. Maybe we'll go over here on the other side and do these while we're at it. Just like so. Don't get too carried away or you'll cover up everything there. More paint here. Just let 'em fall off the brush. It's just that simple. (tapping) There. Let's take and put a few down
here just a little lower. Real close to the foreground here and that foliage. Okay. Let's clean our brush off. And let's work with the one-inch brush. And we'll, what we're gonna do. We'll need to add just a little more of your black mix to your base coat. And maybe just a tad more alizarin to it. We want to work from our darks work up to our lights here. (scraping) So, we get something like that. A real deep color. Let's put it on down
here in the foreground. Let's use the one-inch brush. And just use a little tap. Even just a little circular motion on it. This is just a base coat. Just to give you a coat. You don't want to kill all your darks. You gotta have those darks to create just a little more depth. (swishing) A little more interest
in the painting there. But go ahead and go all
the way across your canvas. And we'll do all those little bushes and foliages in the front there. These may even turn out to be little flowering bushes. Just like that. (swishing) And at home, you can
create your own paintings. Or you gotta get your own
idea and put it on canvas. But this'll just give you some guideline to show you how the brushes work. (swishing) Just like that. Remember to save some of your dark. You don't want to kill all that dark. (swishing) Okay. Alright. Next I think we're gonna need to mix up just a
little bit of lighter value. And we'll go with the same mix and just add just a little
titanium white to it. (scraping) And a little alizarin. (scraping) Want this to end up to a
lavender or a mauve color. And we'll be working with that. Okay let's take a one-inch brush and just dip it into your
magic white a little bit, and then go through this color and pick it up. Yeah, just something like that. Then we'll go up here and we'll just tap on this canvas, just up just a little bit. And again, it's really important on this not to kill all your darks. Save some of your darks. Just go across the base here. And at this time you can press and lift but we don't want to kill all your darks. When I'm going over the top of this with a lighter value
than what I've got here that'll really make 'em stand out. (tapping) Just press and lift. (tapping) These might fireweeds
or something like that. You never can tell here. But remember, I'm saving
some of that dark. I'm doing that for a purpose. When you look at this
with the finished product, if you have some of your darks left, you'll create just a little more interest and it'll look a little deeper for you. Just like that. (Tapping) At home you might want
to take a little time and make individual ones. It's really whatever you desire. Go ahead and get the
entire base of this canvas with this color value here. We'll go ahead and lighten
it up in just a minute. Gotta have the darks before
you work to your lights. Keep that in mind. It'll help you with your paintings. (tapping) Just like so. Okay. Let's use that same mixture. Dip our brush into the magic white. And it'll lighten this up a little bit. But we also may want to
go just a little pinker. Let's add just a little
more alizarin to this so you can really see the color change when you go up to the canvas. Just press and lift again. We don't want this over
the entire canvas now or over each and every
individual bush either. We just want to hit a few places here. See how that brings them
out just a little bit more? Just like that. (tapping) Just brings them out just
a little bit more there. We can also add just a little
more magic white to this and a little more alizarin to even make it stand out
just a little bit more. Just like that. Just press and lift. You don't have to do each and every one because we're going one
more time over this. Just a little bit lighter. Let's catch this guy right here. Look at that. Save some of the darks. Little more magic white. Little more alizarin. And just press 'em right in there. Look at these things grow. (tapping) Now let's go just a little bit lighter on a few of these. Like maybe the light's
hitting them really strong. More alizarin and more magic white. Tap just a few places on them. I don't want to get too carried away. See how that makes them stand
out just a little bit more. They're not all in the light, though, so you don't want 'em all real light. (tapping) But notice I'm still
saving some of my darks. You gotta keep that in mind. Don't want to kill all your darks. Just like so. (tapping) We're gonna get a couple right up here. Now, I think maybe we'll go ahead and clean our brush out. (tapping) We'll go in with a liner brush and if you've got magic black, you can use just ole
straight magic black on this. We'll just put a few twigs
or some dead branches down here at the base of the painting. Just wiggle 'em right in like that. And wiggle 'em right in. Just let 'em flow right off the brush. They're just growing in the wild. Maybe start right in
there and put another one. Just look at that. Flowing right off the brush. Magic white is really nice. Okay. I'm gonna take this one up
just a little bit further. And something like that. Put in one more here. Just like so. Make sure you got the base of those faded into the painting good enough to where they look like they're at least attached to the ground. Make some real squiggly branches on some of these here. Just like so. Then you can go back and go over the ones here on the far right hand side and use some magic white and just barely go over 'em just to highlight 'em just a little bit. Just like so. (tapping) And I think maybe we'll go ahead and sign our name. J-E-S-T-E-R. J-E-S-T-E-R. - Didn't I tell you this
young man was fantastic. Dana, we certainly thank you for being with us today. We look forward to seeing him again. From all of us here, Happy Painting. God Bless. (light music)
