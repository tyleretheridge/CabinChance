- Welcome back, you ready to
do a fantastic picture with me? You got your palette
ready, your easel set up, big glass of tea right beside you? Alright, we're going to
run the colors across the screen in case you didn't
get them last week, and just let you see all the colors that we use on each series here. So today I thought we'd do a picture that, let's do something that's
got some snow and ice in it, and do something that's quite cold, and this is a fun little picture to do. I think you'll enjoy it very much. Now we're going to use this
almighty brush a lot today, and we'll take it and I'll
show you how to work with it. So lets start out, and we'll
take just a little bit, let's use a little bit of Indian Yellow, just a tiny little touch, right on the corner of the big brush, and let's put a sun in the sky. I like to do those. Very gently make a little
circle here, just like so, there we go. Now I'm going to use the
other corner of the brush and go into just a small,
small amount of Permanent Red, small amount, this stuff
is unbelievably strong. So, now, I have yellow
on one side of the brush and red on the other, and
making little x's here, and we got the red on the outside and the yellow on the inside. There we go. Just working around. Just like so. A little touch more of the permanent red. Just bring this right up together here. There we go. Looks like an egg I cooked the other day. It's a good thing I
took up painting instead of cooking because my eggs
don't come out too well. Alright, now, I'm going
to go into a little bit of Prussian Blue, a tiny
bit of Prussian Blue, and Van Dyke Brown, and just
mix them up on the brush. You don't have to worry about mixing them all up on the palette,
just mix them on the brush. And go all the way out
to the farthest edge, and we'll be still using these little x's. We'll begin filling this in. There. As we get farther and
farther away from the sun we want it to get darker and darker. Just bring that right on out. There. Okay, now, I'll clean the big brush. Once again we clean the brushes
with odorless paint thinner. And shake him off a little. (tapping) That's the most fun of painting. Alright, now, we're going to take here and just begin blending
all of this together. Just blend it, working
from the lightest color outward always, just bring it together. And here we use quite a bit
of pressure on the canvas, we're pushing this color into the canvas and blending it together. Alright. Remember not to take this dirty brush after you've hit this gray
and come back into the center. Always work outward,
just bring it together. You don't want to be able to tell where one color stops and the other one starts. Okay, a nice even distribution of color. And very gently I'll just
go all the way across, and bring it all together. Now let's build a happy
little sun in the sky. And we'll do that using a one inch brush, and Titanium White, and let's load a lot of
paint into the bristles here. There. Now, go right into the
center of this yellow color. Push very hard and turn the brush, we're literally pushing this
paint right into the canvas, right into the fabric. There. And we can clean the brush. Okay, now with a knife, we're going to take off the excess paint so we can blend it together. Zoop, that's all there is to it. Now with a nice, clean dry brush, we can just begin bringing
all this together. There. Just blend it. Okay, we just about have a pretty little sky done here already. Now, let's go right in
to the Alizarin Crimson, right into the crimson, and a tiny, tiny little
touch of Prussian Blue. Now, the Prussian Blue
is at least 100 times stronger than the crimson, so tiny bit of Prussian Blue, a lot of crimson in comparison, just a little, there we go. Load this brush full of paint. Now we're going to put some
basic tree shapes in there. So let's go right up here to the canvas, and we touch and bend the bristles, and that's what makes all the
leaves and stuff happen here. Touch and bend the bristles. Turn the brush in the
shape of the tree here. There. Isn't that something? I used to work for weeks to make a tree. And maybe, maybe right here. Right there. But you see how hard
we're striking the canvas, we really want to push this
paint right into the fabric. Alright, maybe, maybe just
a little one right there. And when you're doing this at home, don't worry about following
exactly what I'm doing, we're really trying to
teach you a technique. We're not trying to teach you to copy. So let your imagination be your guide. There, a little more of Alizaran and blue, oh, right here, I see a big tree, there he is. See you just imagine things in your mind and then put them on canvas. Okay, alright we'll just come
right on down here a little. We'll throw in some
nice little areas here. There we go. And over here. Maybe there's a little bush right there. Once again, just let your
imagination go crazy here, and do whatever feels right. Alright, and maybe while we have all this color on the brush, let's imagine that there's a
little pool of water down here. So just pull straight down, it's most important that
you pull straight down, this is going to end up
being the reflections in the water, so pull it straight down. Going to add a little
tiny bit more blue here, there. Make it a little darker so
it looks a little deeper. And the blue will also make
it look a little colder. There we go. Now, very gently, come
across with the brush. Very gently. Already that looks like water, and you've done virtually nothing. There we go. Mmm kay, now, let's
take the palette knife, and we'll use a little bit
of Van Dyke brown here, just straight Van Dyke brown, and let's put some happy
little trunks in here. You touch the canvas, and pull it slightly to the side. Just slightly. And create almighty trunks. There we go. Just put it right up here. And trees don't always grow straight, let 'em, let 'em bend, maybe when they were
little a big moose came along and stepped on them and
put a little crook in them. Kay, here we go. I refer to moose cause I
don't know if I mentioned it, but my home is in Fairbanks, Alaska, so we see a lot of
moose, and caribou, elk, all those good things. There. Going to make that one a little wider. I have decided this is a little closer so we'll make him a little bigger. Just make him a little wider. Now, I'll use a little
bit of the Titanium White, and let's highlight these trees, touch, and just give it a little pull, and when you're doing this let
the knife sort of go around so it gives the appearance
of roundness in the tree. There, just let it go around. Kay, let's go over here and
highlight this little tree. Don't want him to get upset cause he don't have any highlighter. Alright, if this is our light source, this tree is going to be
highlighted on the opposite side, so we'll just come right here, and put a little highlight
over here like so. Okay, while we have this
white on our palette, let's take and begin laying
in a little bit of snow here. Just lay this in. This is Titanium White. There. And gentle touch, gentle touch. There we go. And maybe there's some snow
all around the water here. Isn't that fantastic? And there's no big secret to this, it's like anything else, you learn the technique, you practice it, and you master it very quickly. There. And we're not really looking
for definite shapes right now, all we're doing is just
laying a little snow in. Okay. (scraping) There we go, alright. Now, let's take, and begin highlighting all these trees and bushes here. We use a one inch brush, and back to our golden rule. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So I've dipped the brush
into some Magic White, and then I'm going to go
through the Titanium White. All the Magic White does is thin this down so we can get it to stick to the thicker paint that's on the canvas already. Load a lot of paint into the bristles, probably the biggest mistake made when you first start is that
you're stingy with paint. You've got to load a lot of paint in there so you don't have to hit so hard. All you have to do is
barely touch the canvas and bend the bristles a little bit. Okay, let's make all these snow
covered little things here. All you do is just
barely touch the canvas, and just let 'em bend. There. Look at all of those things. Just touch and let it bend. There we go. Now for so many years I
was a traditional painter, and I spent weeks trying
to paint a picture. Oh the agony, I remember it. There let's put some highlights on this little bush right out here. Okay let's go over to
this little big tree here, there. And I'm going to add just a little bit more of the Magic White to thin it. I see it's beginning
to pick up the crimson, and it's getting a nice warm pink glow. There we go. I can use more paint. There. You got your winter coat out yet? It's gonna get colder. Let's put a happy little bush right there, and let these come right
down into the snow. Very important, do not kill
all these darker areas, or all you'll have is
a canvas that's white, and that's what we started with. Okay, right up here, look at that. So beginning to take shape yet? I really hope you're
painting with us at home, and enjoying this half
as much as we are here. Alright. Look at that, we have one
side almost completed already. I think we'll put some little snow-covered bushes right over here. Once again, don't kill all this dark. Do do do, alright. Just jump right on there. Okay maybe there's
another one right in here. Okay, let's do this great
big ol' tree up here. Thin this paint down just a touch more. And we'll go right up here. Just begin producing pounds
of little sparkles up here. Think how long that'd take
you with your one hair brush. Mmm. Mmm kay. Now, let's take the palette knife, and this is just a clean
knife with nothing on it, and just scrape through
the paint here and there, just to make some little stems. There we go. Alright. And maybe some over here. You know it never stops to amaze me as we travel around teaching this method to watch people who have never painted, in only a day or two produce
a painting that just, they can't believe it, you see them, their eyes light up,
they become so excited, and they can do it, and you can do it. All you need to do is
pick up a brush and try. Okay, a few little sticks here and there. Here's some right there. Now, let's take, so we have some ragged edges along here where I was putting the
snow down to the water. So all you do is take your large brush and grab ahold of it, pull it down, let it become
part of the reflection. It acts as a highlight in the reflection. If you don't have enough
you can go right into the white with the large brush, touch and pull down. Mmm. There we are. Just wherever you want these little highlights in the reflection. And then very gently come across. Just enough to give it a watery feel, you don't want to destroy all of this. Kay. Now, let's take a little
bit of the Magic White, and when you're using this pull it out very flat, and come across, so we can make a very fine line here. Just like so. Just let it go. There we are. Lets bring that snow down
just a tiny bit more. Right here. Just bring it right down. There. I like these kind of scenes because, well to be honest I'm a nature freak, I love to walk through the
woods and talk to the animals, don't tell anybody that. Think talk to trees a ton. But you need to understand
nature to appreciate the great, great things that have been created. We spend so much of our
life walking around looking, but never, never, never seeing. And if painting teaches you nothing else, it'll teach you to see nature, to appreciate some of the
beauty that's around us everyday that we take for granted. Alright. Maybe we'll have, let's do this, let's have snow come right down through here, shoom. There we go. Zoom. And this should make you
happy when you're doing it. Just, it should give you
good feelings inside. Look at there. Just bring it right on through. Maybe, maybe we can make just a little pool out here that's frozen. So we'll bring something around this way. Just let your imagination be your guide. Let it happen. Let it happen, believe in yourself. Believe in what you can do. There. Now, going to take a little bit
of the Magic White here. Make us a nice little waterline. Maybe, maybe we'll just
do something right here. Oooh, that looks cold. Just some little places there where the snow is beginning
to blow into the water. Mmmm. Maybe right over in here too. Okay. Now we can take a little bit more of the
crimson, and the Prussian Blue, and we can throw some little
bushes and stuff over in here. Maybe there's one that lives right here. That's one of the little bunny
rabbit that hides behind, he's getting a drink of water. Right there. Okay, and by doing this you
also create another plane in the canvas, so it
produces more and more depth. Maybe right there is a good place too. We put the dark in first so our light color will show up on it. A little bit more of the Prussian Blue, I want to darken that one, there that's much better. Okay, we'll clean that brush up. Little bit of Magic White,
little bit of Fern White. Let's add just a tiny, tiny
touch of Permanent Red. Just enough to make it have
a little pinkish glow here. A tiny little bit. And we'll come right in here, and begin pushing off
all these little leaves. Don't kill all your dark. There. Alright. There we go. Now, a little bit more. Need a lot of paint on the brush. Okay we'll come right over in here. There. Just let that run right down the hill. Always follow the lay of the
land when you're doing these. You don't want to have
your land running this way, and your bushes running up hill. Always follow the lay of the land. There we go. Now, right down in here. There. Okay. Now, we'll cut a few more
little stems in this. Just here and there. Don't worry about
cutting a hole in canvas, canvas is tough, my gosh, they
even make tents out of it. It takes many years of
using a knife to ever sharpen it enough to have to worry about cutting a hole in the canvas. I'm going to take a little
bit of Van Dyke Brown, and little tiny bit of umber, Burnt Umber, and mix them together. And maybe in just a couple
of little places here we'll put a couple of little trees, just a little stems around. Just here and there, just to break it up a little. And since this is your world, you can do anything in your
world your heart desires. Just let your imagination
take you to places you never dreamed you could go. There. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, let's go right here. Just tap in a little stick or two. Ain't that something? Just some little twigs. There we go. Okay. Just smooth this out a little. Just a little bit right in here. Okay, if you're painting along with me, by now you should have a
painting that's getting very close to being completed. You should have a nice
warm feeling in your heart. And ready to do another
one in a few minutes. There. Just these little sticks, once again they create
depth in the painting. Okay, oops, there's one I forgot. There. Okay. Now if you wanted to, you
could take your liner brush, and a little bit of the Magic
White on the liner brush, and we can highlight
these little stems here. Just a little bit. Well get a little bit of snow on them. There. Okay, we'll put a little
bit on this one here, not too much or it'll disappear right into the white behind it. You know one thing we'd like, as you watch the shows, if you have ideas of things you would like to see us paint in the future, drop us a card, let us
know what you want to see, because we're here to please you, and to teach you what you want to know. So do it, let us know, that's the only way we have
of knowing what you want, what makes you happy, and that in turn makes us happy. Okay, I think we'll sign this one. I'm going to use a little
bit of the thin oil, Permanent Red, there, and turn this liner brush. This is a number two script liner, turn it till it comes
to a nice sharp point, and see how sharp it is, there we go. Now touch, and just
literally let the paint flow. I want to finish this one
up just a little early so we can talk a minute about what we're going to do next week. Cause next week's going to
be a little bit different. It's time we got into
some fun, fun things. Kay. There we go. He he, and I spelled
it right for a change. Okay I think we're going to
call this painting finished, and I'm not going to fiddle
with it anymore today. So, next week, we're going
to do a black canvas. Now if you've never done
a black canvas before, this is going to be a treat for you. If you're preparing
your own canvas at home, paint it with a flat black acrylic, and allow it to dry completely, or you can purchase one
from your local art store. But be sure it is flat black. And we're going to cover the
canvas with Alizaran Crimson, Prussian Blue, Thalo Blue, and we're going to make
a fantastic seascape. Let's make a seascape,
we haven't done that yet. We'll have like a California
or Oregon type coast. Sunset, we'll do a seascape
sunset on a black canvas. So once again, have
your black canvas ready, all my easels set up, and we'll do this fantastic thing together. I think with that we'll close this one. I want to wish you the absolute, every possible joy that life can bring. From all of us here at this station, we wish you happy painting and God Bless, see you next week. (soft instrumental music)
