- Hello, well here we go again. You ready to paint a
fantastic picture with me? I thought today we'd do something
out of the Rocky Mountain areas, we've had a lot of
requests for some mountains that look more like the
Rocky Mountains rather than the Alaskan mountains
that I do all the time. So, that's what we'll do today. I've also asked them to graphically run the colors that we use by, so in case you missed them
on the first or second show, this way you'll have a chance
to pick up all the colors that we have on the palette. So, let's do it. I'm gonna start off here
today with a little bit of Prussian blue. Just a tiny bit of Prussian blue. Okay, and right at the very top we're gonna start by making X's. Just all the way across the canvass. There. Now here you're allowing
the magic white to mix with the colors on your
brush and automatically as you work downward, the sky gets lighter as you near the horizon. So, let your paint work,
let the brush work. Alright. There we go. Now, while I've got
blue on the brush here, I want to add a tiny bit
more blue and a little bit of thalo green, just a little bit. It's very, very strong. And we'll put some water in here. Now, pull your water from the
outside toward the center. And work from bottom to top. And leave a little area open
in the center right there, and it'll create a happy
little sheen of light that plays across the water. Okay. Okay, now, let me wash the brush. And we wash these brushes
with odorless paint thinner. And, be sure it's odorless. Okay, now, with a clean
brush we're gonna start right in the light area, and work upward. Just to blend the sky out. Now, you don't wanna take
all the little actions out, that's the reason we make these
little crisscross strokes. Don't want to take them all out, your sky'll be very, very dull. Look like you pulled a
curtain down at night. There. And the water, we just go all
the way across very gently. Just enough to bring it together. Okay, let's make some
almighty clouds today. I want to take the Prussian blue, and the van dyke brown. And a touch of alizarin crimson. And we mix these on the brush, just just mix them on the brush. Alright, now, figure out where you want
your almighty clouds to be. And just begin working in
little circular patterns. And when you first touch the canvass, if it's not the color you want,
stop and change the color, don't keep painting. 'Cause this is your world, and you can create anything
that you want in it. Blue, brown, a little touch of crimson. There we go. Just let these big ol' clouds just float around the sky and have fun. Clouds are about the
free-est thing in nature. There. Blue, brown, a touch of crimson. Maybe there's another
one right over in here. We're gonna put a couple in so you have practice
doing a couple of 'em. Okay, now, clean the brush again. Okay, let's take the fan brush now, and we'll take titanium white and to that I'm gonna
add just the smallest, smallest little bit of permanent red. Now, this red is very, very strong. Just want to put a little
sunlight on top of these clouds. And go right above the dark, making little, tiny circles
with the corner of the brush. And begin building these almighty clouds. Let them just flow right
off of your fan brush. But don't stay in one
area and keep working. All you'll do is put a big
cotton ball up in the sky. There. Leave some darks in these clouds. There we go. And you'll probably notice by now, we don't use any patterns
or any guidelines, we just let it flow right
out of us onto the canvass. There. This is such a free,
free style of painting. Alright, over here, we'll
put some little highlights. The only guidelines we use in this style of painting is our imagination. Okay, now, once again
with the large brush, we want to blend just the bottom out, not touch the top, yet. We will later, but not yet. Just the bottom. Just the bottom. Just blend it together a little bit. Don't overwork it. Very, very easy to overwork this. Just enough to bring it together a little. Okay, now I'm gonna fluff it up. Just fluff it. Now, when you fluff this thing up, if you get these little
stringies up in the sky, don't worry about them, because
when you blend it together, they go away. Don't overwork your clouds,
they're easy to destroy. When I was a traditional
painter clouds were one of the things that really gave me a fit. Okay. Now, today we said we was going to do some big, brown, Rocky-type mountains. So, let's start with
straight van dyke brown. A lot of paint on the knife, and we'll come up in here
and make an almighty peak. Ah, there we go. A lot of paint. You're just pushing this
paint onto the canvass. And decide where you want peaks. Since you're creating these mountains you can put peaks and vallies
wherever you want 'em. Maybe there's another one right in here. Okay. Just get a basic shape of the mountain. Okey-dokey. And I'm gonna use a large brush and just blend this out over the bottom. Just blend it on the bottom. Now, very gently, lift upward. There we go. That's good. Now, we clean the brush again. Now, let's take let's take burnt umber and cad yellow, and mix it together. Mix it together. Let's throw a little
yellow ochre in there, too. Oh, that's nice. Mix it so it's marblely,
don't mix it until it's dead. Let all the little things
happen in the paint. Okay, now let's put some
highlights on this mountain. And all we're gonna do is touch
the canvass and let it flow. Just let it flow. Let's go right up here. There, let's brighten
this one a little bit. Oh, there, that's what we're looking for. And we need a highlight over
here on this happy little hill. There we are. Something right there. Oops, I see a little light striking that little thing right there. And here we go, here's another one. There, isn't that fun? Just let all these things happen. But you can see what's
happening in here because you didn't over mix the paint. If you'd over mixed it, you
would've had one solid color. You wouldn't have all of these pretty little things that are happening. Okay, now, let's make some shadow color. I'm gonna take a little bit
of white, some Prussian blue, van dyke brown, mix all that together. Maybe a touch more white. There, that's what I'm looking for. And that's, Prussian blue,
van dyke brown, and white. Okay, now let's put some
happy little shadows in here. Maybe right along like this. There. Once again, don't over mix your paint. Allow all these little
things just to happen. Let the paint break, and by break, I mean, leave all of
these little open spots. Just let it happen. Look at that son of a gun. Now, we need a little shadow in here. Don't want to forget him. Every highlight needs
its own, private shadow. There. And a couple in here, and there. Like so. Now, we can go back with a little more of the highlight color and begin building all kinds of little happy things in here. There. Remember, every highlight
needs its shadow. There's a highlight, watch what happens when we throw
a little shadow behind him. He becomes a separate entity. And maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe there's a little bit of snow still laying in some of the little shadowy areas here. So, we take a little bit of titanium white and very gently, following
the contour of the mountain, lay in a little bit of snow here. Maybe there's a little over
in this little place, too. Just a tiny little bit. Okay, now I'm gonna take
a little bit of the blue, and white and put a little shadow right on here. Just lay it right on the side. Now, with a clean knife, you just bring all this together. Just bring it together. There we go. Bring this one right on back down. Okay. Something like so. Now, I'm gonna add a little
tiny bit of sap green. And just drop it right
into the bottom area here. Just like so. Little bit of sap green. And you'll see why here in just a second. Okay. Alright. Now, with a clean, dry, 1-inch brush I'm just gonna begin gently lifting up. Just lift it up. And do this in layers. And work it right up the
side of the mountain. There we go. Want to add a little bit
of cad yellow to my brush so I can brighten a few little spots. There. A little more yellow. Just pop it in. And you bend the bristles and pop it. Dup-dup-dup. Just right on up. There we go. Okay, maybe, maybe there's another happy little rock right out here. Like so. Just let these little things happen where ever you think they should be. Remember, this is your world and you control it. Little highlight color. And little, tiny bit of
shadow here and there. And then, once again
with our 1-inch brush, we begin lifting. Just to bring all this together. There we go. Now, maybe from this little projection, let's mix up some sap
green, Prussian blue, van dyke brown in about equal parts. Green, brown, and blue in about equal parts. Okay. Now then, with a fan brush lets put some little indications of some little evergreens back here. Right about in here. We just want indications. I'm not looking for detail yet. You know, when you're showing
distance in a painting the lack of detail is as
important as when you're showing something that's very close
to you in the foreground and you want a lot of detail. Lack of detail can be very valuable, too. Just a little something like so. And then back to our little 1-inch brush, and we sort of bring all of that together. There. Now, now. That was so much fun let's do some more. Maybe there's a little foothill that runs right down through here. So let's just start making these little indications with a fan brush. It's a good way to make a
lot of trees real quick. And when you see trees
way off in the distance you don't see a lot of detail. You make out basic
colors and basic shapes, but that's all. You knew that, though, I know. Okay, maybe this climbs right on up here. Maybe there's a nice little hill here. And while we've got this
color on the fan brush we'll just throw in some little
grassy areas underneath it. Just like so. Now maybe there are a
few evergreens here that are a little bit closer, so they're going to be a
little bit more distinct. So, maybe there's one right here. And we touch, touch, touch, touch. And just begin building a little tree. There he comes. He's a little closer, so there's a little more detail in him. There. Just a couple of those here and there. Now, I'm going to take a
little bit of sap green, a little touch of yellow, and the tiniest, tiniest
little bit of magic white, just to thin it a tiny, tiny bit. And we'll begin putting
some details in here. Just a little grassy areas back in here. Just run right on up the hill. Follow the lay of the land. Now, with a large brush, grab onto the bottom
of this and pull down. Just pull it down. Straight down. There we go. And then gently go across, just to give it a reflection look. Like so. Okay, now. We'll take a little bit of magic white, and we'll put a very small
amount of van dyke brown in it, just to dull it down. And we'll make some happy
little water lines back here. There. And just let this water
line travel wherever you want it to go, the lines need to remain basically straight. Keep your water in the painting. Okay. I tell you what. Today let's use the big
brush and play a little bit. I'm going right back into this color that I used to make the evergreens. And this was equal parts of
blue, brown, and sap green. And load this brush full of paint. A lot of paint on it. And so often we avoid this big brush, and it will do fantastic things. See there. Now, let's make that into a
nice little evergreen tree. Just use this ol' big brush. Now as I teach this across the
country, one thing I've noticed children are so fantastic to work with. Because they don't know you
don't paint an evergreen with a 2 1/2 inch brush. You tell 'em to do it, and they do it. This is such a fantastic
style for children. My son, Steve, is 17 years old now and he's been painting since he was 12. That son of a gun is an almighty painter. And he makes a happy buck or two. Okay, maybe maybe another little tree right there. Just let these work right
out of your big brush. And we'll put some little grassy areas right out through here. Okay, now, let's go to the other side of the canvass and really make a big tree. A lot of paint in the bristles, let's get up here in the clouds. There. Look at that. Did you ever think you could
make a little, bitty tree with a brush that big? Pick it up and try it, that's all you really have to do. Okay, now maybe, I don't want him to get lonely, I'll give him a little friend there. Maybe right there, yeah. Okay, while I've got this
dark paint on the brush we'll just bring a land mass
right down through here. Okay. Now, with a clean, dry brush,
I'm just gonna grab this and pull straight down,
create some reflections. Come across very gently. Let's put some little tree trunks in here. Use burnt umber, a little,
tiny bit of white in it. We'll come right along here on these trees and just here and there
lay in a trunk indication. There. Now, in case you missed the last show I'd like to re-mention
again, if there's something you want to see, drop
us a line, let us know. We would really like to
paint the type of scenes and the places that you want to see. And you can drop us a line WIPB, Muncie, Indiana and we'll certainly be
glad to hear from you. Okay now, let's take a tiny bit of magic white, little yellow, and sap green. Yellow and sap green. And let's put a few little
trees here and there. There we go. Just let them fall in. Maybe there's one lives right out here. Like so. There's one. Just happy little things. Let's take the large brush little magic white on it, and I'm gonna go right into this yellow. Right into the yellow. Load a lot of paint into the bristles. And sap green. Put the yellow on first
and then the green on top. And let's, let's put some highlights on these big trees here. There. Just let that brush bounce and play where you think light's
going to strike these trees. In your world you even control the light. Oh, look at them son of a guns. There we go. Okay. There we are. Now, let's take a little
more of the green and yellow and pop these reflections
right into the water. Like so. I'm going back to my fan brush with yellow and green on it. And sort of begin bringing
all this together. Just touch. Bend the brush upward. Just like so. I'm gonna take a little
of the van dyke brown and burnt umber mixed, and create a little bank here. There we go. A little bit of highlight
out of brown and white with the least, least
little touch of blue. Just to give it a little flavor. Okay. Little magic white. And we'll throw a happy
little water line in here. And with a nice, clean, dry brush pull this down a little. Just to create some
nice little reflections. And back to my fan brush. A little magic white on
it to thin the paint. And we'll bring a few little
things right down like that. Isn't that something. Now, let's go right over here. Create some little grassy things up here, and the sun shining. There. Oooh, look at all those little things. And they happen so quickly. Okay. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Maybe we can put a happy little stone right out here on this. It just looks to me like
a good place for a stone. And we'll take a little bit of
the mountain highlight color and just put a little
highlight on that stone. And let a little bit of it come downward. Little bit of grass underneath
it, so it comes together. Now, I'm gonna take the point of the knife put a few little sticks here and there. Just a few. And maybe. Maybe I'll add one more little bush here. Looks to me like he needs another one. Right in here, just to separate these two. There we go. And we can put, maybe there's some little dirt in here. Little rocky things showing
through here and there. Put a little bit of highlight on that. And with our green and yellow, just gently pop a few
little things in there. Like so. And I think we've just
about got that one finished. The old clock on the wall's telling me I gotta get outta here,
so I'll sign this one. I'd like to wish you happy painting. Next week we'll do a white canvass. So, have your canvass on your easel and be ready to go with us. Happy painting. (gentle music)
