hey I'm glad you could join me today and today I thought we'd do a beautiful little painting that's got some snow in it in it maybe we'll put a great big barn in it and do it in a lot of warm colors and I think you'll really enjoy it now I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white and it's slick wet ready to go so let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and they'll come across your screen in exactly the same order as I have them laid out on my palette starting with a titanium white and working all the way around to the red while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started and today I'm going to use the old two-inch brush and I'm gonna go right into a little Indian yellow and just tap a little bit of that into the bristles Tiny's a little bit let's go right up here you have to make a decision right off where's your horizon gonna be and in my world I think it's gonna be right about there right about there so just go across I right above that I'm gonna go into a little bit of yellow ochre just a small amount of yellow ochre tapped on to the bristles the same way we'll go right up here right above that little yellow ocher see now where they touch here did he just blend them together a little go right into some bright red I haven't cleaned the brush i'm just still tapping a little color on okay the bright red right there just like you suspected there we go so we have three layers of color you know we can just very lightly just blend those together there we go mmm already we have yeah something ready for the Museum of Modern Art there okay beat the brush off I'm gonna go right into midnight black very transparent black all right let's go up here and I want a very contrasting sky today so we'll put a little black right here just use a little crisscross strokes and let it work right into the sky really huh that easy bad easy well we really do have a modern art masterpiece go in here a couple more colors and we'll have this one finished I'll I laugh because there's a cameraman over here that's got the funniest looking disease you've ever seen I've got spots all over it right into a little bit of the dark Sienna just pull the burst through let's go right up here I'm gonna put just an indication of some happy little cloud shapes still using the same brush and I'm just turning it making little circles little tiny circles little tiny circles so they come right down to the color I like these kind of paintings because it's guys so much color it on they're so bright sometimes winter scenes all they can have so many cold colors in them oh you almost have to wear a parker to to look at them and if you're unfamiliar with a Parker that's kind of code we wear in Alaska it's got the big rough around the top burn cold very lightly very lightly here just gonna blend those colors together so we're just getting a continual progression of color and it's time to have some fun you know I'll go right into a one-inch brush we need some light color in here to separate all these I'll use titanium white a little bit of the red make a nice warm pinkish color okay let's go up here yeah in here but where these two colors come together I'm gonna drop in the indication of some happy little clouds that are just floating around I'm just having fun keep your brush moving keep it moving keep it going all the time over here there's one look at that look at there that easy just drop him him drop me wherever you think they should live that's exactly where they should be there and as many as you want or as few as you want whatever whatever take a nice clean dry brush here I'm just gonna gently gently blend this just blend it a little bit dot / - it's a temptation when you get in here - absolutely kill it over blend there see how that sky is now beginning to come together didn't that a beauty you know of course I know none of us are interested in and these monetary gains but if you are yeah if you are hmm and some of us are these are the kind of paintings itself I've said it before a lot of times painting sell or color as well as content when you're selling paintings study your audience study your audience a lot of times if you're selling paintings predominantly to men men you know we're Juancho men like paintings that are cold a lot of blue in them a lot of mountains if you're selling paintings to ladies they're a little smarter they let you buy paintings because they fit into a room where they match a couch or rug or something and ladies normally would buy warmer colors okay now that I've made all the men mad at me we'll put another cloud over here there we go I'm just crazy about ladies I like ladies their little cloud there and wherever you want them you could spend spend all day just putting happy little clouds in here just a few same old brush and we'll blend this out blend it out tiny little circles fluff it up fluff it up gently blend it all together same way right to see they're hitting it super there we go now let's have some fun I'm going to take the knife go right into a tiny little mound of cadmium yellow just straight cadmium yellow cut across a little tiny roll of paintings go up here all right back in here I'm just gonna let it just Chavis barely barely grazed a canvas I want to put some little some little happy doers in there there see since it'll then play across and with a clean dry brush and this is three hairs and some air lightly lightly lightly stroke the canvas just enough to sort of bring that together don't want to overdo we let this flame add a little bit of liquid white and come down a little bit more cuz we're gonna put some little background trees there and in if you ever might show through a little bit of this guy myself there we go okay didn't had a super sky nothing will certainly warm up a room okay I'll clean my brush give it a shake beat the devil out of it all right let's make some decisions here let's put some happy little trees in the background and for that I'm gonna mix up let's take a little black a little blue I'll throw in a little lizard crimson - what the heck maybe mix a little more black blue crimson mmm let me clean my knife here and we will take all around brush and just tap it in there a little bit like you just tap tap there now this put some let's put some little trees look they're just little basic shapes and they live right in there and just think like a tree how would you like to know would you like to grow here there we go don't kill all the pretty areas that you put into this beautiful sky because I can happen very rapidly just begin putting in some very basic happy little shapes there we go maybe there's one here you notice I usually try to start at the bottom and work out that way it automatically gets lighter toward the top and you keep the dark shadows at the bottom that really helps makes your life easier all right can you let's put a few on the other side over here I don't want him to feel left out I'm just tapping with this brush oh there goes my beautiful little cloud now like that one too that's all right we learned how to make it in the name of the game has practice so if you got some practice your efforts weren't wasted because you know every painting you do you look at it and you know the next one's gonna be better because you learn something from every single painting you do just drop a little bit of that color right in there wherever sort of a back to lavender blue gray whatever okay let's take our liner brush but a little bit a paint thinner on it and we'll go into some Van Dyck Brown turn it brush till it comes to a nice sharp point all right let's go up here now we need some little trunk indications here in there and I'm not looking for a whole bunch just just enough so that when you look back here you can see oh there's one it doesn't have any didn't have any leaves on him he's just laying up there naked there put one right in there that you brush turn and wiggled and have fun because tree limbs grow all kind of crookedly sometimes sometimes maybe a big ol deer comes by or a moose and steps on them and it hurts someone your little let's go over here there's one over here so they're not always straight you know they have to go out and look a long time to find one to make a telephone pole out of majority of them grow sort of crooked there all right so that gives us a little a little bit inside the tree I will take a same old brush what the heck we'll go right into Tiny's little bit of the yellow and today I'm going to add a little bit of alizarin crimson we're going to have a very warm painting here and also a Nana some white too that maybe she will even add some red in there here we go there we go let's go up here and I want to go right up here and just touch I don't want a lot of color yep lot of color yeah we'll put that in later just some happy little snow things you could even take a little bit of blue and add right in there little blue and white just tap it in - that's pretty cold color look at there mmm look at that look at that there's one up here and we're not looking for a lot of detail yeah just just some little indications just a few here and there just a few and then you can begin picking out little things that are down in here just decide where they are drop on you there's one seam right Terra si si you know you was there go back into some bread get a little more of the white don't want the red put it all together right here look at that like sort of a nice little little lavender color beautiful - the color will make this tree have some to put a little wiping right there ooh okay he stands out see that light stands out against the dark nice one that's one them happy accidents and when you get those don't fight with them keep on put a little bit a little bit more they're bright red into that one I'm just really having some fun with the color now when you do this at home if you want to change the color you have an artist license it comes with your first tube of paint says you can do anything you want to do at least on canvas all right that's enough fiddling around there let's have some fun I'm going to take a 2 inch brush here and we'll begin laying in some some areas in the back here where the snow is gonna be I'm just going into this color I've been playing with it's got some pink in it and quiet whatever we don't care now you begin worrying about the lay of the land thank you make a decision which way is it gonna go and it goes sort of that way I'm just laying paint on the canvas right now you can reach up in here and grab a little of this and pull it down or you can even get over here that's let's and these little things happen it's gonna be far in the background we're not too worried about it fact I'll probably just cover it up but several little colors that there's some paint can learn some blue and then I'm picking up some of these little shadow colors there now I'm gonna take a fan brush and very soft just grab that nothing wrong with picking up a little color see how you can create the lay of the land there just like an orca surround let it play let's say I think I'll put a big bar in there anyway so we're not worried about that lift upward so that sort of gives a little misty effect sneaky quiet soft dark back here I spread the little rabbit hides he lives back in there and watches what's going on out here I mean all the crazy people after what are they doing alright let's build a barn now when you do this probably one of the easiest ways I found is to take your knife and very gently scrape out a basic shape this allows you to get your perspective right but most important it takes off the paint that you already have on the canvas and the next layer sticks much easier so let's go right here see I just use a point maybe you can see that but yeah you can see that quite well there we go this thing will come down maybe here here's the other part comes out like so and you're not committed yet this is just giving you an idea maybe there's an arm it lives right over here I miss barn we put an arm over here comes across sorta look at there see that gives you a general shape now with a knife where the knife I'm just gonna tear out rips out Oh beautiful things we head back here there they go yeah thanks today I'll show you a different way to to paint a barn this is an old barn has old wood on it get all this color out I'm gonna put some snow on the roof and we don't we don't want to I know about that yellow snow that affair okay yeah I know that looks terrible you're probably sitting at home saying Bob you have you haven't done it this time use a two inch brush I'm going right into the Van Dyck Brown load the brush full of color give it a wiggle and pull it that brings it to a nice sharp edge looking look how sharp it brushes it's very sharp good let's go up here alright let's start with the overhang there it is see there you could do all of this that I'm gonna do with your knife I just want to show you a different way of doing it grab this pull it down pull down and use both sides cuz ever sides fully loaded - here we go over here look at that then quick there he's gonna have a little arm out - we need to put some wood out there got a little are on the other side put some brown in there and you really you're really still not too committed you can still change your mind here let's go up the side see they're right on the side like that maybe maybe yeah I'm gonna have a little bit of wood chewing right in here all right now I want to make this look like old wood older wood now you're single brush and we'll go right into some white some of the dark Sienna just him just look at the brush there let's go up to the canvas yeah start right here touch no pressure no pressure no pressure no pressure see there it that super helps if you're a little nervous your hand shakes a little bit this is the time to use it there cuz it makes all these beautiful wood effects there we go now we need some on the other side mm-hmm there's a pretty one happening right there beautiful beautiful beautiful I get carried away sometimes just watching there we go let's put something right out in here okay now over here I'll just put a little indication not much of that's gonna show now we can go back into the brown no one put some shadows in here we're just barely touching barely touching this is when we find out if you have a delicate touch alright yeah back to my knife go right into the Van Dyck Brown cut me off a little and let's put us some indication of a few boards in here and I'm just gonna quickly do this so you can see how it's done do to do to do to do just let him go and you put as many boards and yours as you want this carpenter is like me he on to good yes whatever he had he used over here whew there we go now with a clean brush very light touch grab this and just caress it look at that bring all this together have you ever seen an easier nicer way to make old boards yeah now we can get serious first thing we need here is a door gotta have a place to put two Cal there you got a bar and get have a way for him to get in there we go nice door and then say you want put some snow right up here on this little arm snow right along here just just lay it on and go come right down here there we go there we go there we go there we go see and I'd give us an idea of how to do roof I tell you what I'm just gonna sort of block this in so you can see it a little easier on yourself it's also a nice way to cheat a little and give yourself a guide touch just propose just give it a little pull a little pull like so there you go okay now right out here look here look here okay put them horns there is little bit right out here and then just take your knife smooth it out and then it sneaky way to make a part J and I will take the little knife here I want to put some curves in this door it's just the right size for them pull that down there and a little bit of light brown color and we'll just sort of outline it give it a such a high light so it stands out a little better a little bit better this old barn seen its better day it's it's like me it's had a rough life and then we can take and begin working on the perspective here you get all this stuff together maybe it comes right up through there all right all right we're ready to have some fun I'll go back into some of these dark colors Brown little sienna and i black whatever kids go ahead up here maybe there's a happy little tree and he lives right there comes right out through there tell you what we need got a brush here the still got white on it let's put some snow indications it comes right along the barn look at there one thing nice about a big old brush you can do these things in just a second just a second just throw them in I want to add a little blue to the brushing maybe right in here look at that look there so pass indication over here maybe maybe we got a little bit of snow comes down we'll take a fan brush or something here we can smooth all this out this is just a nice way of dropping it off very rapidly here losing this happy little Bush it comes right down through there okay with a liner brush a little bit of liquid white I'm just gonna put the indication of it there we go a little trunk here and there and I'll take the same old brush what the heck we're going into a little red a little white and a little yellow ocher to that will get crazy okay let's go ahead up here won't put some happy little colors in this one just to really warm it up look at that see there that neat mm-hmm and this keeps a little winter scene from being so cold it is uncomfortable there we go and you just put as many little bushes and stuff in there as you want I'll tell you what to tell you I leave scrap some of it and pull it that'll be our Stella that comes out of there hmm take a fan brush new just begin blending all this just blend it that's some of it slide right down here it comes right up look at there so he goes back into there that little brown I got on the brush I'll use that for a shadow right in there straighten up the edges like so this has some fine let's have some fun here and we'll go right into a little bit of black a little bit of blue long and maybe yep right there right there we'll put another layer of bushes this just helps create different planes in the painting to that I'll add a little Indian yellow let's go right there we just put a few little happy highlights on these bushes are you some of the reds and yellows just to make it a happy little thing all right tell you what let's do let's have some fun let's have some fun I'm gonna go right into the brown right into the brown can ask up here maybe their lives does now what is sure doesn't have a big tree big tree this is just a brown he lives right there looks like a big slingshot doesn't hmm that is a big slingshot my dad was the best Ling shot shooter in a country he could really work as I said I came from the deep south so people people used a lot of slingshots then I migrated to Alaska I had to go I had to go find some snow I'd never seen so I was 20 years old before I ever saw snow but I moved to Alaska and almost overnight I saw my share I'm using a little bit of the liquid black now you just put some of that just to create the illusion of some happy little limbs here and there and in your world you put as many limbs or as few as you want just drop them in there we go there we go all right take the knife take some of this color we can use them here I just want to put just the indication of some highlight around this tree just air in there that'll make it stand out a little better see how you can drop in a big old tree in just just a minute or two dad easy easy over on this side the least little touches in blue just to spark lit up and the old clock on the wall tells me I've got to leave you and I'd like to thank you for being with me taking a little bit of liquid white just highlighting laying little snow here and from all of us here happy painting god bless you next week you
