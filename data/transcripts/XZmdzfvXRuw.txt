hmm hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today let's start out and have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and as usual they'll come across in exactly the same order as i have them laid out on the pallet starting with the white and working around today we have something a little different a little unusual up here i've taken an 18 by 24 inch canvas and i have it vertical that's up and down and the bottom half here probably oh it's not it's below half i've covered with black gesso and the top half then it's just left white now i've covered the whole top half with liquid white it's nice and wet and ready to go as usual the bottom half i've started up here with a alizarin crimson and phthalo blue mixture makes a lavender graduated into a mixture of prussian blue and a little bit of yellow ochre to give it sort of a green issue and then graduated on into phthalo blue and phthalo green so we have a lavender a dark green and then a brighter green and this is going to be a happy little seascape so let's let's take off here and have some fun i think you'll enjoy this one i'll start off today with phthalo blue reach over here and grab some midnight black and mix them together so i have blue and black blue and black for black and blue whichever way there we go that's why i always look when i get home late black and blue all right let's go right up in here and let's just drop in some happy little little sky areas just using little crisscross strokes i'm gonna have some big clouds today i think we'll do some fantastic big clouds so i'm gonna make this guy maybe a little bit darker than i usually do just so that the clouds will stand out just drop in some some basic shapes i'm leaving some areas open here and in those open areas we'll come back and we'll put all the little little clouds in let them dance around and have fun there maybe it comes right on down like it doesn't matter and if you get down here into this color that's okay too no big deal we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents okay there i know they're sitting at home saying why not sure is a weird looking cloud bob's making a day and we'll see if we can straighten him out okay let me wash my old brush wash your brush with just odorless paint thinner shake it off just beat the devil out of it now then with a clean dry brush go back and then we'll soften this and sorry if you pull a little bit of this color into the light area there we go just soften it and bring it together just bring it together our basic little cloud shape is still there there okay now then let's have some fun there we go let's take out the brush strokes same old dirty brush don't even have to clean it this time i'm going to go right into some bright red take it and go into midnight black so i have bright red and midnight black and just tap the brush into the color just tap it okay let's go back up here now then we have to make some decisions where is our shadows live in here i'm going to have a shadow right here right against the water we'll just let that work right on up like so just a happy little shadow that lives in there big clouds today so we put the shadows in first and then we'll come back and we'll put some highlights on them just sort of look around here and make it make a big decision where do you think the shadows will live in this cloud there they are oh that's the sun organic i'll cloud wherever and it's not a big deal because if you put a put a shadow in here you don't like it we'll just cover it up we can fix anything wash the brush shake him off this is the fun part this is crazy now then i could carry away this brush clean now then let's take a little bright red and go right into the titanium white just a little this little amount of bright red let's see pull that brush through there load a lot of paint into it okay let's go up here now then let's go up to the top and just begin making all those fluffy little little things on top of the cloud let that brush just dance around there and play in tiny little circles tiny little circles we're making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds and bring it right on down into the dark here right on down now if you pick up too much of the dark color just stop and wash your brush nothing wrong with washing your brush there we go now then let's put some light area right in there right in there see there told you that would be easy there comes a nice little fluffer clouds are free they just float around the skull they didn't have fun they're one of the freeest things in nature there we are there told you was going to make a big cloud today this is going to be a big cloud there he comes right on down there probably about ate up the whole canvas with clouds that's all right if you learn how to make a cloud then it's worth all the effort learn every time you practice you learn more every painting you do you learn a little bit more and you know in your heart that the next one's going to be even better each one gets better now let's take a two inch brush and use just the top corner and we're just going to mix up the bottom of this cloud just gently gently using tiny little circles mix it right into that darker color don't touch the top of the clouds yet we want them to stay strong and bright and shiny right now if you begin picking up paint just beat the brush and that will remove the excess paint see just blend all that together then a son of a gun with a cloud it's a big one big old clown happy cloud there there we go look at that right on down right on down and as i say that just removes some of the excess paint you don't have to go through the whole cleaning procedure now we're going to fluff this cloud grab it and pull it circles though big circular strokes if you pull straight up it's going to look like it's raining up and that'll bother you if it's raining up so try not to have it raining up pull it in big circles big big circles look at that see now we'll come to the next layer and lift it up like so just grab it and lift it upward lift it upward i'm continually beating the paint out of this brush so the brush remains dry and relatively free of color i want just a clean dry brush now if you get too much once again stop and wash your brush there's nothing in the world wrong with washing your brush there we go now very lightly just blend it all together see there just make this as soft as you want it like so very lightly very very lightly three hairs and some air and that quick boy you got one heck of a sky now then if you want to add little details in it you could come back in here see and you can still go back and put little little floaters that float around in there and still change the shape anything you want to do you can do here blend it see give it a little fluff and then that cloud lays right out there right out there in front of the rest of them he went to the front of the class okay all right now we can wash our brush we got a little sky that easy that easy take him off there you go now go ahead and clean this one inch brush at the same time okay we're gonna do a happy little seascape today so maybe one of the easiest ways that i have found to do a little seascape is take this is a number six filbert brush i'm gonna put a little white on it i'm just gonna go up here the thing that we're most concerned about is the one big major wave i have so many letters saying i want to do the big crashing wave with a transparent eye okay let's go right here now decide where that big transparency is going to be maybe it comes right down like this and the water comes wherever you want it and down something like so this is just to give you an idea sort of a guide you're really not committed it's all you need right about there that sort of gives us something to to work by okay let's take a fan brush and we'll start with just plain old titanium white let's go right back here in the background this is just plain white now remember this color already on the canvas and it's wet don't let that color dry now we can go right back in here look at that see here just make little little strokes like it and it mixes with the color it's on the canvas and all these beautiful little effects will happen automatically automatically i like to do seascapes on black canvas because all your dark is already in there for you watch here here's here's something that's fun we'll just take white maybe let's go right in here i'll do this like look at that see and i know you're saying oh bob you've done it this time you may be right let's do it again then what the heck there all right on out like yeah the only thing we're worried about is in this part right here we don't care about that right there we don't worry about that part you're just worried about the black a watch let me wipe this brush off get all the excess paint off of it see which way this is going that will give you a guide now very lightly very lightly just blend that color back this gives you the little trough as it's called trough right in between these see there all of a sudden it'll start making sense now there we go that easy that easy you can make just all kinds of little wave things happening let me clean the brush i'm just writing it on a paper towel go back into my white now then let's make some big decisions here this comes and then it comes like that and we'll do exactly the same thing again just very gently gently bring it back very lightly just barely caressing the canvas if you get too much paint just wipe off the excess see there all right all right i knew you could do that this is one of the nice easiest ways i have ever found of making a happy little seascape there we go okay now then let's take and worry about this nice transparency here so for that i'm going to take white white titanium white and the least little touch least little touch of the cadmium yellow just load this filbert brush full of paint a lot of paint okay now then decide where your little transparency or the light parts going to be and begin laying it in scrub it in get tough with it right along the top and then gently gently gently just blends right on out to nothing then we need to you can do this as many times as you want to achieve a desired effect or desired lightness clean your brush each time and reload it with paint because you want this to be bright area right in here and you can add more paint to it now if you begin getting a build up of paint it begins getting too thick i'll show you i'll show you take your knife and just scratch it off see that value remains on there you can wash it go back see and each time it's going to get a little brighter a little a little shinier you can do this as many times as you desire and here you begin worrying about the shape of this major wave there we go just like so and i can wash the brush get it good and dry now then with a clean dry two inch brush very lightly very lightly i'm going to begin blending this little transparency here and here i'm going to grab it and begin working on the basic shape of the wave as it goes out it's going to get flatter and flatter see there how easy that is doesn't have to be hard there we go and that gives us some of our initial shapes okay i'm going to clean that old brush and beat him dry let me find another fan brush here okay go right into titanium white right into it there's a little blue in that color too so it's not pure white a little tiny bit of blue that was left over let's go up here now then this wave is going to be crashing over and this comes over here and goes got to make those little noises so it won't work okay reload it reload it touch touch see there how easy that is if you pick up too much of the under color you may have to wash your brush several times but that's all right that's all right then we'll go back and get our little filbert brush take some white some let's use some alizarin crimson and a little bit of the a little bit of the phthalo blue more crimson and more blue i want a little darker oh now we're getting there there we go that's what i'm looking for dark lavender looking color load the bristles full of paint just really rub it in there okay let's go up here now maybe there's some nice foam splashing on here we're putting in the shadow for the phone just scrub it in scrub it in scrub it in hard but work on work on your basic shape here now maybe it splashes ch way up like that comes right around this is the shadow this is the shadow this is where you put the dark part of your foam in clean your brush you'll be an expert brush washer by the time this is over be sure the brush is dry though that's most most important okay now then i'm going to go back into white with the absolute least little touch of the cadmium yellow probably can't hardly even see any in there but there's a little touch in there at least at least little touch okay let's put some highlight on this foam now sort of hold the brush to the side here and give it a little upward push so that when it hits at the top then it makes all those little splashes and as one side gets wore out all the colors used turn it over it's got two sides on it wipe off the excess and you go back in there and get you a little more there we go just place that in there okay wipe it between at least wipe it between each application so you get that dark color off it starts getting dirty give it a good good wash there we go pick up a little more white a little touch of yellow in it there we go now let's go right in here gotta make those little noises there we go we'll just let it come right up here and break the horizon all kinds of happy little splashes see there we go a little splash right there and then a super little way though to make like a happy seascape now find out if you have a really delicate touch just to corner the brush just the corner and just gently gently just sort of wind it up just little tiny tiny little circles barely touching the brush is hardly moving just sort of blend it all together see how soft and look at that water churning there you don't so you say you don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help now then that's fine there we go let's really get let's get wild today i'm gonna go right back in to the white right back in maybe right along in here maybe there's a there's another little door comes right out like that and then we'll blend this one back and this begins making the shape of the large wave here see there it's picking up that colors underneath all the beautiful colors we had here we had we're beginning to hit the phthalo green and phthalo blue mixture just begin coming together this is where you create the shape of that wave so angles are very important pay attention to them here very very important of course now any big nice seascape needs a stone for the for the way he used to be crashing against we got us a splash so let's put a stone right here i want to break the horizon with that so it comes right on up maybe this is a big tall stone a bump out here and wherever this is just straight van dyke brown all you need is just a basic little little rocks out here whatever you think your rock should look like that's what it'll look like there we go now then i'm going to take the fan brush and i'll take some paint thinner on the fan brush and go right in to straight bright red but it's very thin very thin this is bright red it's thinned with paint thinner very thin okay now then let's just take this and go right over the edge of the rod you can do this with a liner brush and really put a lot of detail into it i just don't have time here to set into it one stroke at a time but at home if you want to really shape these rocks take a liner brush and you can just make all kinds of beautiful little effects maybe there's another little see there see there all kinds of happy little things and just sort of blend them out just go on you know maybe there's a see there just as many as you want or it's view now we can take our our brush that has the white on it just begin putting some little splashers down here at the bottom lift it up lift it up now we can begin working all kinds of happy little things tell you what i see let me get the small knife i see right in here another happy little stone he lives right there right there and he's got a friend well tell you what i got i got another idea got another idea when you're painting these you just look up here and you see all kinds of things happening let's put a little highlight on here this is just a natural this is a natural let me grab a little white maybe this there's another little wave coming here and it's splashing up against the bottom of this and there's just foam and churning and carrying on see there that easy working layers now maybe there's another happy stone right there he's a little smaller and we just use a knife and put a little touch of highlight right there on him go back put in some foam around his foots rock needs some foam if it's churning over now i have sort of blue and white on here we can begin creating all kinds of little foam patterns in here just like so all of the angles in your wave it's most most important maybe here's one spilling over coming down leave some little holes in there just like so all kinds of little things sometimes you i like to use a fan brush because you can just do beautiful little effects with it like so see how you can make it look all like water all kinds of little things going on and you can really get carried away and spend a lot of time making beautiful beautiful effects now then let's take i'm going to take a touch of paint thinner right into the the brightest color that yellow and white and i want to highlight just these little edges here they could come right on down see there there we go and back in here where the light striking this put all kinds of little details back here this is what really really makes your seascape stand out all these little doers see let them run their back up through here and you can you can just take and put hundreds of these in just hundreds of them just wherever you think they are to go see some in here this is where you create the shape of the wave use a lot of paint thinner so the paint is very thin i think where light would strike in here see all the little details you can just drop in that easy that easy you can do it do you ever think you could make such a seascape so easy i like these black and white canvases they they open whole new worlds to you you can do all kinds of beautiful little effects there we go all kinds of little little things that are happening in the water see there and you can take the blue and white and put with a liner brush and put all kinds of little watery things dribbling down the side here i think that'll give you a good idea of how to do a fantastic little seascape quite fast so i'll take a little of the bright red we'll sign this one right here good thing i have a short name doesn't take but just a second hope you've enjoyed this and i hope you too enjoy painting along and doing a fantastic seascape and from all of us here i'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and i'll see you next time hmm you
