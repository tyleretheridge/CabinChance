welcome back I'm certainly glad you could join me this time today I think we'll do a painting it's a little bit different and let's start out and we'll have a run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me today and while they're doing that come on up here let me tell you what's happening I've got a canvas as you can probably see it's painted yellow and this is just a about acrylic yellow paint and I've covered the entire canvas with it and right here is just this is a piece of duct tape I found here in the studio just you can use duct tape or masking tape any kind of tape but I just made a circle right there this canvas is dry today and on to this we're going to begin putting a little bit of the liquid black color and I'm going to make a beautiful little sunset eye of it okay let's go right up here and I'll just use a little two inch brush and I'm just going to start laying in just letting in some little little things just like so just sort of just make a decision to decide where they're going to be lay I mean it's very very little of a liquid black on the brush here very little can we get a touch more on my brush okay just once again barely touching the canvas just just caress the canvas let it go across my hands there and we're just gonna lay these in just at random here and there little more of the black this is gonna be a fun painting as I say it's different than anything we've done before and I really think you'll enjoy it this is gonna be a sunset and this will be the Sun I hadn't figured that out already that's gonna be the Sun and we're all finished we just bring some of these dark areas right across it right across it maybe there's another one right here we don't know we don't know at this point we're really not we're not all that committed one thing it helps when you're doing this particular painting is a very smooth canvas I always use a very smooth canvas but in this painting it's really important so your brush will slide all right let me wash the brush just scrub it off here shake off the excess dinner give a little wrapping off we will go now I'm going to begin adding some color into this and we'll start off first with a tiny little bit of a lizard crimson and just work it into the bristles tap the brush tap it see and that way you get a nice even distribution of color all the way through the brush okay let's go up here I'm going right into the liquid black letting it mix and we get pulling a little bit of it out Slayton and work together all these little colors just happen this happens there and in this particular painting we use a very limited palette very few colors in it and the colors that we use in this painting are most of them are very transparent so the yellow will show through this crimson here is extremely extremely transparent beautiful beautiful colors and down here when we get around what's what's gonna be the Sun we gonna forget it we want this area here to be brighter and brighter and brighter all right so I'm gonna leave leave some areas open now I'm going to go right into a small amount of Indian yellow very transparent yellow tap it let's go back up here now start right up here just begin laying that yellow is try to keep the yellow off the liquid black cause black in yellow as you probably know makes green we want to have all these beautiful oranges and yellows and Red's and this painting there you know we get a lot of questions that come in to us and one of the questions I hear over and over again is if I talked about having a clear acrylic palette but not palette on TV does not look clear there is a reason for that and I should have told you before I take I take in few sandpaper on my palette to scuff it up otherwise it creates huge glares on TV the same as we take and we cover the brush furrows and stuff with tape just just keep them from shining even the knives are covered t9 will go right into a little bit of cadmium yellow and right around the Sun here where it's bright add a little bit of CAD yellow and I did work out see there if all kinds of pretty little face and and without cleaning the brush I want to add a small amount of titanium white just tapping the brush into it again now figure out in here where you'd like to have some some happy little highlights little clouds and all you got to do just so give that brush a little wiggle and let it go now the white is very opaque it's real pink this painting will teach you a lot it's a lot of fun just that queer light what's striking a little bit don't overdo with this it's easy to get carried away don't overdo maybe a little strikes right here just sort of let your heart be a guy take you where you want you know we travel all over the country doing classes and and seminars and I like to I like to ride at night and listen listen to my CB radio I've got a CB radio of my band I listen to to the truckers and there's super people that well let me tell you what a night of traveling listening to truckers on CB will give you more education in five years of school you can't believe some of the things I've learned I really enjoy talking with there we go we travel we travel all over and we need so many fantastic people when we're doing this because I said in some of the other shows up I really believe only super people paint and enjoy art there we go now we can just keep on and on you can take us to any degree of lightness or darkness that you now I'm just using the brush side words to jest blending it all together just like so maybe tell you what listen let's put a little bit of light up in here and you're painting in your world you put it wherever you want you just you make these decisions decide where the light is and lay it in look at all those colors mix and blend hmm now if you had covered the canvas with the liquid black and tried to do this with yellow wet you would have had a lot of problems you had a bright green sky because it's dry you get away with a lot of things you almost literally get away with murder like a dad I've got this quite bright so it shows up well under set but at home you make it and that easy that easy we've got a very effective little sky okay let me wash them a little brush off then we can have some fun and just covered a cameraman right over there he's gonna give me now then we'll take the knife come come right down here so you can see this very close I won't take the knife and just reach under get it started yeah just peel this off look there you go and that easy that easy you've got a happy little son right there now then right now if you come out up close here again let's take a look see right now you've got a very distinct line here you don't want that with a fan brush I'm going to begin to very gently blend this but allow some of that color to come across he has softens those edges there okay this is just a clean dry very soft pan brush look at there see how it brings out all together gives us sort of a mysterious effect let's make a good Halloween picture that's grating getting very close to my birthday I was almost worn on Halloween my father not both were born very close to that date there we had one day apart in our first dates so we always had a deal you know since it was so close together he had to give anything I had to give him you need but he had always sneak ready get me something then I felt bad there we go wash that brush dry it very lightly I'm just gonna put into all this to give now look how soft that nice edge is here okay now we can begin putting in some happy little things here I will take the same old fan brush go right into my midnight black load it full load it full okay let's go right up here now hold some distant little trees little evergreens you probably see me do these hundreds of times just take the fan brush and tap just taps you know one of the most exciting things that happens doing a show like this we get hundreds of letters from fantastic people all over the country and they send me pictures you can't believe some of the paintings of people are doing all over the country you know I thought today maybe maybe I'd like to share some of those with you so I've taken the liberty of taking a few of these pictures that people have sent and I've stuck them on a little board here I don't have the cameras just sort of pan across let you see what people all over the country are doing now this is just a random selection there's many many more and if I didn't show your painting I apologize the next time next time your painting will be here I'll just keep making these little trees while you're doing this huh I'm not doing anything you don't know about we'd love to hear from you and see what you're doing drop us a card send us a photograph maybe maybe next time we'll get your painting on TV if you see your zone there thanks for sending it to me because I'm it does wonderful things to my heart to see that this is working so fantastic for you see we just keep writing drop it in a few of these little trees can you believe some of those paintings people were doing and you can do it if you're not doing it pick up a brush and join us because you really can do it there's no secret to this there is no secret to we show you everything you need to know here there okay how do I give us enough little trees to play with right now just little indications then we'll take a little two-inch brush here and I'm just gonna tap the bottom of it a little bit actually I'm just getting a little color on the brush and then we'll begin pulling it just the in pulling it tap it pulling it and here's where we begin creating the lay of the land you can pop that up see it makes a little misty effect there look at that make all kinds of beautiful little things happen that easy and easy we don't know where this goes right there maybe put a little color on my brush maybe just goes right on over there all right put some big trees I think there so I'm not worried about that area right now I'll show you how to do some beautiful evergreens in here I begin to look like an old moon though that Horace and it's could be a moon now to think about it could be the moon so you got to make another decision scizor sunset or a moon set anyone just rub that a little and lift it create that nice misty effect and don't kill all these light areas they're going to end up looking like little patches of light shining across here try to say you some preserves of them they're your friends they'll make you painting happy all right that's that's take why I'd be scared to walk out here at night on by myself got to be a booger living there let's build some trees that's bill some trees I'll just use this black load the brush for both sides both sides good and full of paint okay maybe there's a happy little tree that lives right there but normally if you watch the show before I tap down to create trees this time I've got a lot of letters in home trees in my yard the limbs grow upward so all you do is the same basic thing just push upward with a brush we'll do those cat in this painting you know I don't want to do them all the same that way it'll give you something else to play with if you painted with me there we'd like to continually give you new ideas and just just keep you going okay tell you what to you it may be yep right there there's another one certainly is no well he's laid out here in the sky and one side of the brush runs out of paint turn it over to the other push gently upward there we go and as you go down push harder harder so the limbs get bigger and stronger and this one maybe comes to right there wherever you want it wherever maybe there's some little happy things that grow around his foots a little bit of stuff right there there we'll soften that up with a big brush in a minute and that will help create another plane in the painting more depth now you know some of the trees what some of them have a hard time this one's back here Oh maybe maybe he died on us someone just put him in there you need a few dead trees in your painting - it helps helps make it look more real nature Nature has live things and dead things look at their to you but maybe right here maybe yep here's a big healthy one oh he got a lot of water a lot of sunshine give it a little push band there we go and leave some spaces in here you need you need places for the birds to set the wind has to get through so leave some spaces it makes you tree look a little better little birds need a place to sit let's take our big brushing again just scrubbing some of this then just grab it scrub it all carries a little effects and once again you're just allowing some of that under color to show through and by changing these angles it helps create the lay of the land they call these little grassy things which is another one wherever wherever you decide where they live there's one better little plane I like these kind of paintings they teach you how to use color we're using such a few colors to do this here the fun came because here you work with a lot of values they'll go right in here and just just lay in a little bit of color right in here just pop it up for you look at that look at all the little things that are happening I get excited when I see these hmm okay I'm having I'm having so much fun making all these little trees I'm gonna make another little tree here maybe he lives right here and this tree okay okay I'll tell you what he comes all the way down this tree he's got a few little things that are hanging on here and a few that aren't you know some of these old trees were they they're like people there's individualís people some of them have a few limbs here and there that's what makes us interesting we're different we all have different personalities and we look different that's what makes people interesting and trees and bushes they're the same they have personalities they're just people with little stronger roots and most of us have they can't get away just pop it up let's have some fun I want to put a big tree right in front of the Sun here just throw it right in front of the side we're going to check and see if you're brave today load a lot of paint into the brush a lot of paint I'm using the same old brush but look how full it is it's really just loaded with paint okay let's go up here now decide where this tree lives that I want I want to show some Sun on both sides so I'm out doing right there oh right through right through look at that look at that Bob's messed up the painting that's one of the beautiful things about oil paint you it's you really can't hardly make a mistake because with oil paints you can just you can just take it off the canvas if worse comes to worse while it's still wet you just taken zip it off take a little thinner clean the canvas use it over and over again or if it's dry you can paint right over the top of it no big deal you don't don't have a waste of canvas okay maybe there's a little ledge right here that set something look at that let's give him an indication of a big old strong foot out here hold him up we don't want this tree to fall over it fell over it Phil fall right into the Sun there can't have that happen just pop in a few little weeds go right out there there we go so we just had one tree he'd get lonely and he'd pick on all these other ones out here so let's let's put another big tree over here back into the black and this big tree yep dozens now anyway he lives right there deal is right there ok easy idea so I'm just tapping with a brush just really suck it suck it to it there we go but look at all the little fuzzy things that happens right here see when you when you hit hard with that brush you get all these little fuzzy edges and evergreens have all these it's they just have all a little I don't what you call them look at that top give it to me that looks more realistic than a nice smooth tree if you want to smooth tree just take the brush and pull it straight down and you'll get a smooth tree I personally prefer one it's a little fuzzy but everybody sees nature through different eyes I just want to show you how to make many effects and you make the effects that it please you there we go there we go you know I have got to tell you a little story we recently did a demonstration in Boston for some of the most fantastic people in the world and I met a lady there and you know we all wonder if we can paint this lady is blind and she watches his shows and she paints along with us and she does fantastic pictures if she's watching this god bless you because you're a super lady and I really enjoyed meeting you and I hope the next time I come back to Boston we can get together maybe we can paint together and have a super time because I thought that was the most fantastic thing I had ever heard of I'm gonna take a little bit of the liquid black and put it on my palette and I'm a liner brush go into some paint thinner I want to make this even thinner it's literally like water turn that brush Candis go up here let's put some happy little limbs up right across to the side there it is see because his paint is so thin it literally literally just flows off the brush look at that look at that there's one right there and just put as many as you want wherever you want this is your world so you create you create the type world that you want there was freedom on this canvas his freedom boy I have have so many beautiful ladies who write and they say you know what I'm painting the kids don't bother me and I I create own world and it really makes me happy and that's true I was a single parent for a long time and I understand a lot of those things love those things put some limbs over here you know it's turbo they never teach me anything about how to take care of a house boy house my son still talks man you tell people all the time about me making him eat burnt TV dinners I'm not just about the world's worst cook there and just drop he's in wherever you want there we go there we go maybe on this series we'll get him back and let him paint for you he's 20 years old now he cooks his own burnt TV dinners okay now then let's take and put some leaves on there I'm gonna use a number three fan brush normally I use number six Dan will use number three load it full of paint just like we did the other one just a lot of paint okay let's go right up here now since all these were going up let's take and just take the brush and push these up and create some happy little things that live right out here now we don't want to kill this the Sun here we work so hard to put it in don't put so much I want you kill it leave it in there all of them don't have to have leaves maybe out here there's only a few little ones maybe here there's just a couple just come you know make these decisions wherever you want to that's where they ought to be all right kathy geiss's it's really fantastic to be here with you it's hard for me to believe that with the completion of this series we'll have over 90 half-hour show's over 90 that's almost unreal to me almost unreal and I can't thank you enough for lagging into your home mm-hmm you're beautiful people thank you okay here we go just drop it in all these happy little things and you just decide where you think his leaves would be wrong but leave some of the stalk here some of the trunks showing it makes it a little more interesting and you can always take your liner brush and go back in here see you and add some little things in here to hold it all up if you want to I guess it right here I think you ought to have a few more limbs in it wherever there you go just like so now then without cleaning the brush I'm going right into SAP green right into SAP green I'm just going to load it for even though this is very dark very dark you might be able to see a little greenish tint so I'll put a little green on the brush it's really loaded full let's go back up here now up here on the tops of some of these leaves I'm just going to push I hope you can see that and you said at home it's so dark it's very hard to see just gives a little greenish tint when you do this painting at home you'll see it and just here and there here and there but a little bit of highlight on it sort of separates these and creates a beautiful little painting just like so and maybe down here we'll have a few little grassy areas just a couple just sort of breaks it up okay I think this one's ready for a signature I'll take a little bit of the thin oil some red mix it up real good till it's like water let's go right up here and I'll say in this one I'd like to thank you for being with me today it's always a pleasure for me to paint with you I hope you've enjoyed this one and just given you a lot of ideas and we see you again next time until then happy painting god bless you uhh
