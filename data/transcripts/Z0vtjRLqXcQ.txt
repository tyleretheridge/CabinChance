- Son of a gun. Can you believe it? Here we are on the last
show of the series. You know, when we did the
first series, at the end of it, we had my son, Steve, come
in and read us some questions and we devoted the whole show to a question and answer period. In that show we tried to show people the way to correct the
most common problem areas. So I thought we'd do that again today only this time I'm gonna take life easy. I'm gonna read the questions and I'm gonna make my son, Steve, paint. So, I'd like to introduce
you today to my son, Steve. Steve, glad to have you with us. - Well, thank, Dad. - Okay, let's get right in here and maybe we can get started. First question. Dear Bob, What is meant by, use criss
cross strokes to make the sky? Do you use criss cross strokes
to make the water also? Okay, well let's just go
right up here in the canvas and I'll try to show you. Okay, Steve. Load a little
blue into your brush. What do you got there.
a little phthalo blue? - Pthalo blue. - Okay. Now, let's go
right up to the canvas. There we go. And as you notice, he's
using both sides of the brush and he's just making little
Xs, just back and forth. By using both sides of the brush we assure an even distribution of color. The canvas has already been covered with magic white. So it's picking that up and automatically as it goes down toward the horizon it gets lighter in value. Now Steve, the other
part of the question is, do you use criss cross
strokes to make the water? No, we do not. There we use strokes that come from the outside in. Steve, why don't we make a
little bit of water there? Just come from the outside in and... Okay, he's gonna add a little bit of pthalo green to his
color. Just a tiny bit. Now, pull from the
outside in. There we go. We want water to be level
if it's still water. So by coming from the outside
in that happens automatically. And if you'll leave a little
area open in the center when he pulls from the other side, when the paintings finished
that'll look like a sheen of light going across the water. There we go. Now, Steve, why don't you
take a clean brush and just blend all that together for us
and we'll see how that looks. Okay, not he's just
using a clean, dry brush, still using the little criss cross strokes and blending the sky together. And you can blend it to any
degree that you want now. When you're doing this
at home, you don't want kill all the little actions
that happen up here in the sky, just blend it to about like he has it now. On the water, all we do is take and use very long strokes and go all
the way across it, just gently. We don't want to lose that
light area in the center, but you can bring it together. That's it. See how that's coming right together? Okay. Well let's go right along here and go to the next question. Also, if there's any questions that we don't answer during this show, drop us a line and we'll
be glad to try to answer almost any question that
you can come up with, as long as it's not too personal. Dear Bob, how do you make those fluffy little clouds using the fan brush? Those really are nice clouds. Let's see if we can get Steve
to demonstrate once again how to make some clouds. So Steve, why don't you
load your fan brush, hold our palette over
here so we can see it, and let's just load it full of... There you are. See how full he's getting this? A lot of titanium white. Okay, good. Now... Use just the corner of the brush. There. See how he's using just the corner? And all you're worried
about is the nice tops. Steve, why don't you put
one more little cloud over here on the right side? Clouds need friends too. There we go. And all you're looking for is
a basic shape at this period. Don't worry about it too much. Okay, now, with a large brush, we can just blend the bottom
of it out a little bit. There. Just the corner of the brush, don't use too much of the brush, and you make little tiny
circles. Little tiny circles. Then fluff it up and hypnotize it. See how simple that is? Okay, let's do the other one here. Using just the corner of the
brush, little tiny circles. Just blend the bottom of it out. Okay, now fluff it up and hypnotize it. There. Super, Steve, thank you. All right, let's see here. What's... Oh, we're not gonna read
that one on TV, we'll just... We'll set it aside and go on. Dear Bob, I'm having trouble putting the snow on the mountains.
Can you help me? This is probably the most
common problem we run into. Probably the biggest mistake
made is applying too much pressure when you're putting
the snow on the mountain. So maybe we can go back
to the canvas and get Steve to drop us a little
basic mountain shape on here and we can actually see the
highlight happening close up. Steve, what color did you use there to make your basic mountain? - Blue, brown, and alizarin crimson. - Okay, there we go. And you use very, very firm pressure when you're putting this basic shape on. Really, really push it into the fabric. And all you're worried about
is just a nice top edge. You could care less what's
happening underneath. Okay, now, let's take the big brush and we can just blend that right out. Okay, what Steve's doing there is scraping all the excess paint off. The less paint you have, the better. Now we're just pulling that mountain out. This does two things when you pull it out, it removes more of the excess paint and makes the next step easier, and it allows the mountain
to blend as it goes down. Mountains are always
more distinct at the top then they are at the bottom. If you can see the entire mountain. Good. Okay, let's use a little
titanium white there, Steve and I think that will
show up contrast better. Okay, turn your knife over and let us take a close look at it here. Let's see what you have in way of paint. Sort of rotate it a little
bit so we can see it good. See, it has just a little
paint right on the edge there. Okay, now, just barely touch. Here's where the problem happens. People use too much pressure.
Use absolutely no pressure. All it is, is just the
weight of the knife. In your mind think where light
would strike the mountain. There. It looks like
he's gonna have a little peak back in the background. This one's gonna come all the way through. There you go. We'll have some
character in this mountain. While Steve's doing that,
I'll tell you a little bit about him, because I don't
think he'll tell you. Steve's 18 years old, he travels all around the country with me teaching this fantastic
method of painting. He's also a black belt in karate. It's good to have some
protection with you. Okay, now he's mixing up a shadow color. He's using a little bit of blue and white, just prussian blue and white. Now one of the big things here when you start doing your mountains, you have to make almighty decisions. This little peak here, is
it in the background, Steve? - Yes. - The little one? - Uh-huh. - [Bob] Okay, so we'll just
push him right into the back. Oh, you're gonna make
them all in the back. - [Steve] Yeah, I'm gonna make
them all in the background. - [Bob] Okay. It's fantastic
that you can change your mind right in mid-stream like this. Now notice the angles here.
Angles are very, very important. There we go. Okay, good. A little bit of
shadow on that little peak. Okay, now, if we wanted to
create a little mist there, we'll get steve to wash a brush real quick and show you how to create
a little bit of mist. Okay. Now I'm in a
dangerous position here. He's gonna get me. Okay, now when you create this mist, all you do is just barely
tap. Just gently, gently tap. There. Always follow the angle in your mountain. Lift upward, just takes out the tap marks and softens, creates the nice misty areas. Beautiful, Steve. Absolutely beautiful. Okay. Well let's go to
the next question here. The next question is, I'm having trouble making the little foothills that you have. This also is a pretty common problem and we'll try to show you
right here how to do it. The first thing you need to
do is mix you up some color and I think Steve's gonna use a one inch brush today to demonstrate this, but you could do it with a
fan brush, a two and a half inch brush, or the one inch
brush, whichever makes you happy So let's watch Steve. Okay, Steve's mixing up... What are you mixing there Steve? - Blue, brown, and white. - Blue, brown, and white,
okay, on the one inch brush, and you notice he's just
mixing it on the brush. That way you have a multitude of color happening on the brush. Okay, now, maybe we
can get a close up here and watch what he does. He's just barely tapping the canvas and making a basic shape. There. And put some character in your foothills, don't have them just come straight across. Notice all the little
hills and bumps and valleys he's got in there. It makes your painting a
lot, lot more interesting. Super. Okay, here he's just
laying in his basic color. And this is just tapping,
all he's doing is tapping. There's several different ways to make it, you can use the brush vertically and pull downward and it makes
very nice foothills also. Okay, now he's gonna lift gently up, make it look like little trees maybe that's way, way back in
the distance somewhere. Very soft and quiet. When you do this use very,
very short little strokes and do it in layers. Notice
how he's working downward. Good. Very, very nice. Okay, Steve, while you have that going... Well, you're not quite
finished yet I guess. - [Steve] No, I think
I'll drop one more row in. - [Bob] Okay, good. That'll
show us how to create depth in the foothills. Now what he's doing is darkening
the color a little bit. As these little foothills
get closer to you, allow them to get darker
and that helps create the illusion of distance in your painting. Okay, what, did you add a little bit more brown and blue in there? - [Steve] Just a little bit more of both. - [Bob] Okay, good. All right. Now, while he's
got color on the brush he could add a little bit
underneath, just a tiny bit, and that'll help create reflections. Might as well go ahead and put some beautiful reflections in
there while we have it. Now with a large brush, we're gonna take and pull those reflections down. There. Now when you're pulling
these reflections down, be sure you go straight down with them. It will disturb you terribly if you take and put them at an angle. Okay, pull straight down, and
then very gently go across and that will create
the illusion of water. Okay, super. Let's take a look at the next question we have here. Dear Bob, I can't seem to make water lines with a palette knife. Now this seems to give
a lot of people trouble and I think the first thing you should do is put the magic white on the palette. Don't try to just dip
your knife in the can. If you do that and touch your canvas you're gonna have a line that's
a quarter of an inch thick and it's probably gonna be runny, so put a little bit of the
magic white on your palette and pull it out as flat as
you possibly can get it. Just really mash it hard so
it's very thin on the palette and then take the knife
and sort of just cut across and maybe we can get Steve to
demonstrate here. Okay Steve? Now Steve's mixed a little
bit of brown with it. Now, just pull the
knife across. Very good. All right, now show us
how to make a water line. Are you using quite a
bit of pressure here? - [Steve] Yes, just like you're trying to cut a hole through the canvas. - [Bob] Just really cut
it then. Saw it in there. And you can make this water
line go anywhere you want it, you can go up, down, sideways, crossways, the thing is, if it's still water, these lines need to be basically straight or your water will run
right out of your painting and it will really bother you when you look at this painting later on. Very nice, very nice. Okay,
let's go to the next one here. This one you'll like, Steve. It says, Dear Bob, can
you show me how to make an evergreen tree using the fan brush? Now evergreen trees can be made with a two and a half in
brush, the one inch brush, or the fan brush, all
three work equally well, so you try them all and you find one that's very comfortable to you and that's the one I recommend you use. The fan brush will give you
a little bit more detail if you're looking for a lot
of little limbs on your tree. So let's see if we can get
Steve to make us one here. Steve, what color are you gonna
use to make your evergreen? - I'm using a little bit of
sap green, van dyke brown, and a little bit of prussian blue. - Okay, that ought to
make us a nice dark tree. - I want it to look black. - Okay, let's go right up here and notice he starts
with just a centerline and then just using the
corner of the brush, just sort of work back and forth. There. And that's basically
how we make a tree. You can add a little more to
it, you can take away from it, this is your tree so you have
to make almighty decisions. Steve, why don't we put
another one right beside him? Trees get lonely too. We've got to give him
a little friend there. Make this one a little bit- - [Steve] Maybe a leaning one? - [Bob] All right. There. Maybe when that
tree was just a little baby somebody stepped on him while
they was down there fishing for that big trout and he's
got a little crook in his back. Very nice, Steve. Okay. Let's go right on in here and
see what the next question is. Dear Bob, can you show me how to highlight my trees and bushes? I can't make the paint
stick to the canvas. Once again, a very common problem and we've said it over
and over in this series, you need to start with a paint that is as firm as you can find. It should be very, very firm and dry. A good way to test your
paint is to take the cap off and squeeze the paint. It should stand about
that high above the tube, roughly three quarters of an inch. If it won't stand up by itself like that, chances are it's probably
too thin for this technique. So test your paint, there should
be no oil running out of it it should be a very dry, firm paint. If we start with a very firm paint, then it's much easier
to put highlights on. Because a thin paint we
can stick to a thick paint, but you can't reverse that. You have to start with a very firm paint. Okay, let's see if we can get Steve to make us some little bushes here. He's already got ahead of us. - I just took the liberty
to go ahead and do it. - Well, all right. He's using
the two an a half inch brush. It would also work with a one inch brush, and we just drop in
some basic shapes here. Steve, while you got
all that on your brush, why don't you just throw
some color in the water and we'll show them how
to make reflections too. - [Steve] All right. - There. And all we've done is just drop the same basic shape right into the water. Good. What color did you use on that? - A little bit of sap
green and prussian blue. - Sap green and prussian blue. Very dark, very nice color. Okay, you want to take your brush and pull those reflections
down just a little bit? Now watch what happens when he does this. Good. Now keep them on the ends smaller so they match what's above it. Okay, let him clean the brush up here and we'll get ready to go right along. I'm fixing to get splashed again. All right, so if you notice me having blue freckles from now on, you'll know why. Now here he's just making
a horizontal stroke across to give it a watery appearance. Why don't you drop us a few little trunks in some of those trees there, Steve? - [Steve] Okay. - And for that we'll
use the palette knife, a little bit of van dyke brown, and watch how he just
drops them in. There. And you touch and just
pull slightly to one side. He's gonna put some in
the evergreen's too, okay. - [Steve] Yeah. - [Bob] All right, now, if
you want to highlight these little tree trunks, we use
a little brown and white and just put a little bit
of highlight on there. Now our mountain tells us in this painting the light's coming from the right side, so we need to highlight the right side of the trunks also. Once you put that first
stroke in the mountain you've just determined where
your light's coming from for everything else in this painting. Okay now, the other
part of the question was is highlighting these. so why don't we use a one inch brush and let's show them real close here how to put some highlights on. Start with a little bit of magic white. That thins the paint down. What are you using there, Steve? - Going into a little bit of yellow ochre. - Yellow ochre, okay. And notice the amount of paint
he's loading into the brush. A lot of paint in the brush. Steve, why don't you hold the brush right up here against this dark area and let's show them real close
what the brush looks like. Good. Look at the amount
of paint in there. It's very, very full. Okay, start at the very top,
because you want that to be the brightest part of your bush or tree, and begin laying in your highlight. You need little patterns in here. Don't just throw them in at random. Now with the color that
you pick up on your brush you can go back through
the yellows that he's using and sort of change it
a little bit. Maybe... Okay, what are we gonna
do here? Right there? - [Steve] Maybe drop a bush over here. - [Bob] Good. Isn't that a beauty? Okay, why don't you add a
little sap green to that and let's see what we get. Okay, a little more of the magic white to then the paint down. Okay, which one you gonna do now? - Oh, probably the one on the end. - [Bob] There. Once again,
go slightly above the dark. You don't want any shadows
on top of the bush. - Okay, maybe try something different. - [Bob] All right, why don't you put us a couple of more little bushes in there and let us see close up and we'll go right along here. - [Steve] Maybe one with a
little bit of orange in it. - [Bob] Okay. Very nice. Notice how he's layering these bushes. This is what creates
the depth in a painting. It's most important that
you layer these bushes. There we go. Now, why don't you take a
little of that same color and reflect it right
into the water, Steve? - [Steve] Okay. - [Bob] And here you
just reverse the brush and just put a basic bush,
tree, right down into the water. Very gently. You don't have
to use much pressure here. Good. Okay... This son of a gun is quite a painter. I better watch out or he'll be on TV and I'll be home by myself. All right, now we can take a large brush and pull down very gently.
Three hairs and some air. There. There we go. Now just go across in a gentle,
horizontal stroke and it creates the illusion of
reflections that fast, that easy. Okay, another problem that people run into quite frequently is putting land in. So I'm gonna have Steve
take a little bit of van dyke brown on the palette knife and show you how to lay
some land underneath this. Okay, there he goes. We've
got a little bit of brown. He starts at the small
end, just barely touching, and notice how he follows the angles here, the lay of the land.
That's very, very important that you follow the lay of the land and let it get larger as it goes back. This will cause you to
look into the painting. It leads the eye into the painting when you're looking at it. There. Okay, all right, Steve,
why don't you take a little brown and white and make
us a little highlight there so this stands out a little better. What color did you use
for your highlight there? - [Steve] Just a little
bit of brown, a little bit of blue, and some white. - [Bob] That was van dyke brown I assume? - [Steve] Yep. - [Bob] Okay, now, to sort of
clean this up a little bit, straighten the bottom
out and to separate it, we'll use a little bit
more of the magic white and make us a little
water line underneath it. Okay, remember how we load
it, we just cut through it. Steve's got a little magic white that has a little brown in it. There. This thin paint
will flow off your knife. And as he said earlier,
you push very hard. You really, really just act like you're trying to cut a hole
right through the canvas. Good. Okay, Steve, why don't you run a few bushes down that bank? - [Steve] Okay. - Just to clean up that
nice, straight edge and I think you've turned
out a beautiful little painting here just showing
the answers to the questions. There we go. Beautiful. That breaks up that long, straight edge. Makes it a little more
pleasing to the eye. Now, with the clean point of the knife, we can just cut in a few
little sticks and bushes. Steve, just take the
point of the knife and cut some little sticks in the bushes. Okay, and use a pretty firm pressure here and just cut them right in. Okay, that's very good. Now, do you know what let's do? - What's that? - Let's take, let's add
a little bush right here and show them how far
it'll push everything back. Just take one of your two
and a half inch brushes and drop us in some dark
color right there real quick. - [Steve] All right. - [Bob] Just small little
bush right here on the corner. It's always interesting
to see how you can add one more plane. There we
go, just a little one. There, a little prussian blue,
van dyke brown, sap green. There you go. Just let it go
down at an angle a little bit. - [Steve] I'm gonna
make a little row here. - [Bob] All right, beautiful. Now, let's show them real quick how to highlight those and that'll
give you one more chance to see how these things are highlighted. A little trunk in there
with some van dyke brown. Now we can put some highlights on here. Now when you're at home you can use any color that you want to create all these beautiful little highlights. We're trying to use
very bright colors here so they show up well on your screen. He's got a beautiful orange here, it's made from mixing a little cad yellow and a little bit of
permanent red together. Good. There. Once again, layer these
so you have depth in them. Look how much distance already
this is creating in painting. It really pushes everything back. It adds another plane to the painting. Okay. There we go, a little
sap green, a little yellow. Very nice. Okay, a few little sticks in there with the point of the knife. It's just a super way to show you how to add another plane into a painting. Okay, good. Well, Steve, what
do you think of this painting? - Well, I think it's pretty good. - That's very nice and
I hope that everyone has enjoyed watching
you answer the questions and do a beautiful little painting here. I'd like to close the show and take just a few minutes of your time and I'd like tell each and everyone of you how much we appreciate you
allowing us into your home, how much we appreciate you
being with us each week. It's really a pleasure to be here, to try to teach you this fantastic method. I'd like to also take a few moments and thank all of the fantastic
people here at the station that have worked so hard
to make this show possible. They put in a great deal of
time, they work very hard, and I think they produce
you a quality product. So on behalf of all of
us here at the station, we'd like to wish each
and everyone of you, happy painting, God bless, on behalf of my son,
Steve, thanks for watching. - See you next time. (soft music)
