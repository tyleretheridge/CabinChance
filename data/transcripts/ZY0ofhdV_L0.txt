Oh welcome back I'm certainly glad to see you today you ready to do a fantastic little painting with me super tell you what let's start out and have around all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along while they're doing that let me tell you what I've done I've got my standard canvas up here and I've covered it with a thin even coat of the liquid white and it's all wet and it's ready to go so let's get started I'm gonna start out today with the old two-inch brush she would just have a good time today just have a good time won't take a little bit of phthalo blue here just work a little bit into the bristles there let's go up here now then let's just start up here making little little crisscross strokes little X's there did the color continually blends with the liquid white and it gets lighter and lighter in value as it works downward and in the landscape that's exactly what we're looking for we want it to get lighter and lighter toward the horizon there we go a little bit more color yeah we'll just come right on down like so we're where it doesn't really matter not today may be such a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive let's let's just do a nice happy little scene just sort of let it happen let's see let's see what we come up with and very lightly just gonna blend the entire sky alright that worked out pretty good shoot let's keep going here and we'll take some blue and alizarin crimson we just mix a little bit of this on the brush phthalo blue and alizarin crimson I want to I want a little lavender color there something that like so it doesn't matter let's have a happy little cloud that just sort of floats around we'll put in some dark just using little round circular strokes a little bit of dark shadow color then we'll come back and we'll highlight that little rascal will make him shine stand out in the Sun but just little circular strokes there we go maybe comes we don't know somewhere over in here what the heck just let him go let's wash our brush and if you paint with me before you know we wash our brushes with odorless dinner shake off the excess and just beat the devil utter that's the most fun part of the whole thing I'm gonna take her we'll take a one inch brush one inch brush pull it through the white I'll be right back I'm gonna reach over here and get the least little touch of alizarin crimson just a small amount okay let's go up here now let's take and you can do this for the fan brush or two-inch brush I just thought I'd use a one-inch today just want to put the indication of some nice beautiful fluffy little clouds that live up here in the sky and they float around and have fun all day just wherever you want to wherever you want on there to go there to go there to go see one after another as many or as few as you want in your world that's going up here there pick up that just a touch more crimson just put a little warm glow in these clouds looks like the sun's having a good day and he sparked them through there there now the paint that we use is very dry and very firm and that way you can blend all this while it's still wet if you use a thin soupy paint chances are you're gonna become a mud mixer and you're going to be gonna be unhappy with me I don't want that to happen be sure your paints very dry and very firm there we are now I'm just gently gently blending gently blending can will beat the brush I just removes excess paint from the bristles and we can continue to bloom here just blend it all together knock off the excess one more time now then very lightly I want to fluff this cloud up just grab it fluff it just allow all this to come together see there but once again now if you're using a thin oily paint oh would you be in trouble here and you'd really be upset it's most critical that you use a paint it's very dry very firm and then this works you can blend all this color without without it mixing together okay and that easy well we've got a whole bunch of big fluffy clouds just floating around and we'll take some more of the phthalo blue alizarin crimson proportionately much much more crimson than blue there we are I want a dark lavender color here take a little roll of painter right on the edge of the knife let's make a big decision maybe there's just a nice little hill that lives we back there goes really push this into the fabric now want these to be rounded on top just just some nice little distant hills there I got a letter today and somebody wanted to know why I didn't paint some Hills life was in the east there so I thought we'd just do some nice nice some distant Hills today cuz they're fun and they're beautiful and they're quite easy to do take our large brush and very gently grab that paint because of canvases wet we can weave it can blend it see yeah we can just pull it let all kinds of little things just happen there okay that easy we can make the indication of some very nice little Hills back here and that's basically basically all you have to do now blending the bottom of it out allowing it to mix with a liquid white so it creates that illusion of mist down toward the base okay maybe we'll have some rolling hills on top of that use the same old lavender color I'm going to add a little black to it just tap a little bit into the into the brush okay now you have to start making some decisions maybe there's a hill oh he lives right there see just a big nice beautiful rounded hill and all we're doing right now is putting in dark color so we're we're certainly not committed at this point we can change our mind we can move this we can do it anything that we want to do okay maybe there's another one here I don't know just watch here what's you maybe you want to change see how you can make this one you can change the shape you can make it taller shorter there however you want to just let it go there we go anyway when I get a little brush go and shoot I'm just gonna have some photo take some Brown crimson crimson black so we get Van Dyke Brown black crimson little blue I'm just going to basically just paint this out I know all this is probably going to be covered up in here so let's just paint it in that's when that big brush really comes in handy you could do this with a paint roller all we're doing is applying some dark color this is also an excellent scene to use some liquid black in and do all of this there you have all that filled in that easy that'll save us a lot of work later I'll shoot I'm lazy and I look for ways that make it easier use it same old dirty brush and we'll go right into right into CAD yellow cadmium yellow reach over here I get a touch of the yellow ochre just a touch and tap some color right into the bristles just tap them okay now then maybe back here just all kinds of beautiful little things that are on these hills this is where we begin creating the shape form lay of the land whatever you want to call it this is where you start taking your time and and really making these things look good or what's - why we'll get a little add a little titanium white to our color don't make that he'll stand out from the other one see there why that son of a gun stands out now since it comes around its going to get darker and darker darker darker they're spent astok what you can do all right right up here there's one I wanted at least little touch of the bright red to my color won't this one depth look at there maybe Jack Frost has come through there and he was having a good day to just layer after layer after layer as many or as few as you want in your world okay come right on over here maybe this one comes up and goes like it we don't know you don't know doesn't matter however you think this should be that's the way they ought to be okay a little more in there but you can put hills down here too that easy and sometimes on little distant Hills you have like little trees and stuff that are little patches of trees that have really really grown and gets strong so to mix up a little lavender color again I'll just use a fan brush what the heck get a little bit of that color on the brush now maybe maybe we're gonna have some little things that live right here between these two we can just take the brush and just tap just make the indication it some little little patches of trees and stuff that live right in there maybe over here is another one wherever you want him just put a couple here and there just breaks it up a little we can come right back clean up the edges put all that back okay shuto is fun let's do some more it takes more blue-black alizarin crimson there we are clean off this whole knife I just wiped a knife on some some paper towels there to clean it no big deal or soft rag whatever you happen to him came in to back in here maybe there's some little trees and I'm pushing very firmly here maybe that's just a little tree sink that live right in there like so strike firmly then you have to make some big decisions where do they live there fantastic that you can make that many little tree indications that quick and that easy okay now maybe we want to create a little mist at the base of these we can just tap just use a clean dry brush tap firmly say there creates that illusion of mist there ical looks like those trees are just sort of setting in some soft misty area and it's very easy to do it if you're doing if you're doing landscapes you need this miss between each layer that helps separate and brings them apart and it makes your painting special okay I get carried away sometime here this gets to be so much fun maybe there's some little trees that I'll just use the big brushes we have it going here hey this little trees are a little bit closer use that same color I'll put in another layer just layer after layer there we go now then we'll just keep using these two inch brushes shoot there's a lot of funnel take some yellow reach over here and I'll get some bright red we said Jack Frost was beginning to play here so just tap a little bit right into the corner of that brush right into the corner I want a nice bright color oh isn't that nice look at that so you can just use this two inch brush use just a corner of it and put all kinds of beautiful little tree shapes there we are you know we finish this series my gosh are be nearly nearly 200 joy painting shows certainly hope you enjoy them you hadn't got to see all of them call your local station they're available to you'd like to see some that you haven't you just give him a call they'd like to hear from you anyway there we go another question that I get repeatedly is what in the world I do all these paintings that are left over that we from the shows we donate these paintings to PBS stations all over the country and they auction one often they make a happy buck to help them out so if you'd like one give you station to call Tonder tell them you'd like to see one and you're be willing to make a make an offer on it if they had one help them out they need your support there we go let's see just using the top of that brush we've created a beautiful row of trees here some real what you can do now that clean dry brush I want to create a little mist at the base of this just a little I just want to distort it I don't want to decide I want to destroy it it's very easy to get in there it gets fatigued oh it gets feeling good and you just just destroy it but all we want to do here just miss the base of it just so it sort of floats around I just use the same old 2 inch brush let's go right into some of our yellows and greens and all those pretty colors just tap the brush give it a nice little tap that's come down see a change in the angle here will create a new and different plane very soft and gentle look at that there I like that I like that I like soft paintings they're a little harder to do than harsh paintings but I like the soft velvet look and with a little practice you won't have any problems not any at all okay we just coming right along here see when you're when you're painting like this stand back and look at your look at your work the son of a gun you'll see all kinds of beautiful little things happening in it and one of the one of the joys of this is that you can change your mind in midstream you're you're not committed to you're finished you can we have no patterns we don't we don't worry about having any predetermined notion of where we're going that may be one of the most fun things about this put a little dirt in here so you stand back take a look and you might start off in your mind with something going on and halfway through the painting change your mind and decide well that's not what I want to do this I see that and that's where the freedom comes in that's probably to me the most impressive thing about painting this way as the freedom you have total and absolute freedom here little brown and white because I've just seen something here that's why I'm going through all this talking I see something here I want to change I just it looks like a natural to me so you get a little yellow blue yellow green on my fan brush okay now we'll bring a little little grassy things right down here into this dirt rocks and stones that sort of cleans up the edges and brings it all together now then let's see if your imagination is as wild as mine cuz I see a beautiful place right here for a happy little stream so let's try that and we'll take first of all I dip the brush into liquid white then go into titanium white the liquid white is there only to thin the titanium white so it'll flow over this other color and a little bit of blue in it just to give it a little color and in my mind right here there's just a happy little stream it's coming down here and it's splashing and carrying on and whoops OOP fell over right there see there's a stone into the water right there and it made it just it had a happy little accident look at that wherever you want it and there's all kinds of little things happening it just little bubbler is going on there look at that oh boy in our world we can do anything we can literally create little streams maybe maybe maybe maybe yep see that a little thing tell you what watch you watch getting excited now please you can get carried away with this maybe there's some stones that live here there's a stone see this Van Dyck Brown maybe over here there's another stone however many you want just drop them in there is one I take a little bit brown and white I will put a indication here of a little highlight on top of that stone so it stands out now back into my liquid white titanium white a touch just a touch of a phthalo blue just to touch now then here comes my water it's been along here hits these stones and goes push and just crashes right over look at that look at that and it splashing down here where there's just all kinds of things going on there it comes over the top just like a day at the races look at that this I'm about to run out of canvas here maybe maybe we can nail another one on the bottom keep going here this is just huh I better stop I have to finish some time now go back into my lavender color let's put some land over here and close this in as I say if I gets if I get going here we'll never get this rascal finished my imagination sorry catches on fire and off we go I've got them director back here she'll come out here and drag me right off the set if I don't get finished in time there and then and I'm gonna pay for that comment you watch a little bit of grass right here just to sort of bring all this together on the other side we need some little little grassy things happening here - we're just bringing it right down so to bring all that together you CAD yellow Indian yellow yellow ochre touch of the bright red here in there whatever whatever just sort of let them come together look at all that I ended fantastica that little stream just sort of it just seemed like it was a place that it ought to live that was where it should be and on your painting look around in your painting you might want to change your mind at any given moment and that's your privilege add a little pressure in blue right in there too and some Van Dyke rounds of crimson with this dark maybe over here in this corner you've got to fill that up maybe there we go maybe there comes there's a nice tree Liz right up here and will go into a touch the dark sienna want us to start getting the lighters with work effort I tell you what this tree this whole tree yep he goes right on off the canvas there and maybe who knows maybe maybe there's another little tree right here it sort of leans over hangs out over this wherever you want to let's put one on the other side we don't want that left out dark sienna and some of our other dark colors there we go we'll just have another little leaner here sort of just closes out all and makes it look nice makes it look nice take a little brown paint that on the liner brush it with this here and there we'll put an indication of a few little trunks and sticks and twigs that easy it's going the other side here we have a tree here soon really helps you make those little noises of course your family sort of looks at you like you you're weird but that's alright that's all right long as you're happy there see there all those little sticks and twigs and oh there comes another one let that brush wiggle to jiggle and just let the paint flow I like trees itter oh they've had a rough lives there all kinds of funny shapes and got arms just stick out everywhere they've got some character to shoot these old telephone pole looking trees ain't no fun these are fine there we go okay all right I'm gonna grab like I'll use a one-inch brush for this what the heck a little touch of the liquid white pick up a little bit of dark color so when we touch the yellow all that'll turn green tap a little bit of color into the brush there nice let's go up here now then think about start with this one hot dang think about individual limbs and parts in these trees don't just throw them on at random look at their hmm just let that come right on down here all these little bushy leaves and branches and stuff that's what makes your tree have shaped and formed what's had little yellow ocher maybe shoot we can get crazy and I had a touch of a bright red just to touch test attach don't get too well that's pretty that is pretty checkup rocks had a good day there why was he having a good day I like all these colors right now in your world you paint whatever color that you want because work each individual each individual we travel all over doing shows all across the country and we meet so many fantastic people there all right I'm gonna take my big brush we'll go right down here clean up the bottom of this bring it all together look at that leave this dark under these trees cause normally there's a big shadow under these trees like so son-of-a-gun a little bit over here I think we have a finished painting I'm gonna grab the old landlord brush and paint thinner on it let's sign this one I think we'll call it finished a little bit of red then down and we can just write her name right on there I hope you've enjoyed this painting I've certainly enjoyed being here with you today it's a fantastic painting
