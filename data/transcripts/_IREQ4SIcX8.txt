hi welcome back certainly glad you could join us today it's a fantastic day and I hope you're enjoying yourself so I tell you what let's start out today having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let me tell you what I've got done up here already okay today as you can plainly see we have a black canvas up here now to make a canvas black we paint it with black gesso allow that to dry completely then I've covered the entire canvas with transparent color and let me tell you what colors I've got up here because I want to I want to have a beautiful bright little painting today so in here I have Indian yellow which is a transparent yellow it may look sort of green on your screen but we watch what happens then right above that I have little Lisbon crimson with a touch of phthalo blue in it the top is just they low blue on the bottom I've got a little streak going right down here the same colors this is just Indian yellow put a little of that lavender color on each side down here in the bottom a little dark Sienna thought we'd do a little ocean scene today and I'm going to have a beach down here so the dark sienna will turn out to be your little sandy area if all goes well and then I decided where the horizon was going to be and here I've just put a piece of masking tape across so we'll have a nice straight horizon line and it's slightly above Center you don't want it right dead in the minner in the middle it just it won't look right okay so let's have some fun now this is a fantastic painting to do for friends and neighbors and and don't tell them that you've already put all this transparent color up here because it'll look black and then you all you do is take a little bit of the white we'll just use the old big brush today as I say don't tell them anything prepare the canvas so they can't see it I'm telling you all the secrets but don't tell them what you've done and then just walk up to the canvas give them a big smile and touch it with white watch what happens because when you touch it with a white all of these beautiful colors will just come alive and they'll thank your magician years ago when I first started demonstrating I used to do a lot of canvases like this just start with a canvas that looked black and then begin adding the white and letting all these colors happen okay now I'm going to wash the brush wash the old brush that's the fun part and there's a screen down here in the bottom of my cam that I scrubbed the bristles against shake off excess you just have a little fun and off you go now then you can make this guy as bright as you want but I suggest strongly that each time you start with a fresh brush by that I mean good and clean and fresh color and go right in here and decide where your light area is going to be start in the light area and once again blend outward just blend it outward there didn't that fantastic you have to wear sunglasses when you do these paintings they're so bright and so beautiful now on up in here we're going to begin hitting that little lavender color add a little more of the white to the brush hmm and that's something we just blend them together here and you're putting an opaque color which is the white on top of all this transparent color it's over the black gesso a little more of the white will go right up in here now we begin hitting the phthalo blue there just making little crisscross strokes more of the white but what a sky you can make color stands out so much brighter on these black canvases there can you wash the old brush again one thing about these though you will become an expert brush washer and that's all right it's a lot of fun there one of these days I'm going to show you our camera people so you can see what they look like there and all I'm doing here is just blending these colors together so you can't tell where one color starts the next color stops just just blend them together so they're nice and friendly be careful not to pull this blue down into this yellow or you'll have a bright green sky chances are that's not what you're looking for today there we go one more time let's grab a fan brush I'm gonna go right in to let's see we'll use some black and some alizarin crimson that's good just black and crimson and then yeah then maybe there's a few happy little clouds that live out here so let's just go right in here just barely touching the canvas with a fan brush just decide where your little clouds live and just put in some very basic little shapes using sort of a rocking stroke split that brush just rock and play there it will rocking chair stroke sometimes I feel that's where I should be is in the old rocking chair there we go but then you drag out your paint brush and you realize how much fun life is the heck with a rocking chair let's paint thats painted there we are you know story I'd like to tell over and over again because I I hear this so many times people write and they said Bob I'm not satisfied with my painting and you've heard me say this before I hope you're plagued with dissatisfaction as long as you live because as long as you are you'll strive to do better each painting that you do brings you new insight into painting you learn from it and that's what makes it so much fun and if you paint a thousand paintings or ten thousand paintings the next one's always going to be the masterpiece you'll always find room for improvement there seems like that's basic loops basic little cloud shapes now then let me just grab another fan brush I have several of them here take a little look white a little white be right back get a little little tiny touch of lizard Crimson put in it okay now then maybe we'll just add a little highlight here and there I don't want much don't want much just a little just here and there just to make these little clouds a little light sparkling here and there just think about the little light rays hanging through having fun there now clean brush this is your bravery test just go right over that it'll blend it right together be very gentle and you can create beautiful little clouds and that easy there all right now then let's take let's take let's take I'll pull some white out there put a least little touch of yellow ochre into it least little touch of alizarin crimson make sort of a peachy color maybe a little more the ochre okay ochre there we are oh that's nice that's getting nice and that's even better who makes you feel good just to look at it okay let's go right up here maybe back in here we have just a happy little cloud he lives right back here on the horizon it floats around he watches the ocean and all the little seagulls and he just has a good time maybe it's a big cloud maybe over here this more see we just use the corner of the brush use little tiny round strokes tiny little strokes tiny tiny little strokes there don't let him get too big there look at all them little clouds and then fantastic grab a little touch more of the crimson here I want to be a little darker it's farther away from a light source over here a little bit darker little darker wash the old brush off okay large brush all we're gonna do is just stir it up a little just blend it mix it tease it barely hurt and we're gonna fluff it they're very lightly very gently over the entire thing and if you want to get a little crazier Neville even more fun and take a little touch of the white and go right in here and maybe just let the indication of a few little highlights that live on it just some of these don't over - don't overdo sometimes it starts to feel good you get carried away mm-hmm there just a few just to sort of break them up and show some definition between them there that will gently blend the bottom out saving those top edges fluff it there you go look at that just floats right out there in the sky let's do that one - what the heck blend them all at once isn't that a very very effective little sky that you can do just just quick as a devil can do easy okay now that let's take and pull this piece of masking tape off and you have a nice straight horizon line just as straight as it can be but there was no pain under there so I'll take a little bit of Indian yellow and we just come right up to the horizon line a little that color in there there okay we'll take a little touch of the lavender but on the sides same as we have everywhere else and it'll all it'll all work together there we're in business yeah then clean the old brush one more time now I'm going to take the fan brush and just plain titanium white plain old white now then we have to start making some big decision here maybe we're going to have a big wave back here somewhere you just take the fan brush and just put in a basic idea maybe it comes up like it wherever you want it just we want to save that area so we'll just drop that in here's our light source go right into that with pure white just begin still making that little I'll exaggerate it a little rocking type stroke I'm really exaggerating there but that'll that'll begin creating the illusion the little things happening like that it picks up that color it's underneath all those beautiful little things happen automatically you don't have to worry about it don't have to sit and try to plan it it will happen for you maybe I bet if we have a nice little deal lives right there so you just give a rough it in wipe your brush off and then very gently we can blending that color back there just blend it back okay same thing right here let's just blend a little that color back we want to save this dark area that's very important too good for him good good friend just like so darker darker darker as it gets away from you over here okay maybe there's some some part of that wave it's curling over so for that I'll take some point a little touch of blue should be right back and get a little bit of a little tiny tiny bit of CAD yellow and head in there I want this to be sort of greenish color all right now maybe this wave maybe it comes here the lights hitting it you gotta make those little sounds you don't make those little sounds won't work yeah maybe it will but it's more fun if you make the sounds there it's like so to shoot we don't know maybe there's some over here too will have a will have an ice breaker in here there okay grab I'll use that maybe I use a number three fan brush that's fine brush will take some blues and blue some alizarin crimson reach down here grab a little touch of white the more white just mixing up a dark lavender color there we go nice maybe we'll just use a fan brush that you could use your filbert or your fan whatever I'm scrubbing in some shadows here all I'm doing is I hope you can see that it's putting in a dark color for the shadows maybe that ye comes up maybe it breaks on itself right here wherever you want it just sort of think like a wave your water you're coming over here and crashing there okay wash it old brush that was the number three fan brush we wash it and thinner and just wipe it on a paper towel Purvi get it clean I didn't get mine clean for a life too there now then let's just go into some white plain old white once again number three fan brush at it come right on top of that color that we laid on the lavender just use a corner of the brush begin just pushing upward make all those beautiful little foamy things maybe they just go with you and over we don't know where they go comes right on over I say it helps to make all the little noises pear just all kinds of nice little foamy areas and then good clean dry brush be sure it's dry and we're going to take the top corner of the brush and just you're barely barely moving the bristles barely moving barely moving it looks like I'm moving at a great deal but it's just barely just winding it up a little and it'll bring that right together tiniest little strokes tiniest little strokes there hmm and that lavender that we put underneath automatically becomes your shadow and you wave or in the breaker in the phone whatever you call it there we go and it let's take some white take a little light find a little a little yellow there we are and let's go it's a little blue in there too so it makes a nice green let's go right up in here and let's just scrub in a nice eye or transparency this is the this is the light part now once again take this brush you barely barely move the bristles barely move it you probably better if you did this before you put the phone one be easier then begin thinking about the shape and form of the water Adam won't go back in hearing it just redefine this edge of this nice foamy thing right here almost broke it up damn very gently blend that all back together okay maybe this is our light source tune maybe there's some light shines right through there wherever you want it just pull it down grab it pull hard really get tough with it give it a strong pull and just go across there it looks wet already and then tell you what let's take the knife I'm using the small knife and get this little tiny rule of just white paint now let's make a decision maybe in our world right here's the foam coming down just take a knife push very hard I'm bending the blade absolutely bending the blade now then let me find a clean fan brush here now we want to take this touch it and just begin blending it back there we go back there and that's easy it's a super way I'm making some very effective little seascapes very very effective now then we have some things coming out of this way some nice foam patterns that are happening here wherever you want all these little doers in here that's what makes it interesting and at home you have unlimited time you can just set and make beautiful beautiful of things as I mentioned before I go over 30 minutes they don't have any sense of humor here they come out and drag me off here do evil things to me now let's begin putting some little doers in here this is just the sum of the lavender colors just making all kinds of little things we can go in here and pick up some of that lighter colors just all of them bring them together these little lines they really make it to stand out hmm tell you what cute that was so much fun let's have another one maybe there's a another one lives right about here right about there just put the pay no flash very hard to that and I really been that night get tough with it and then back to our fan brush grab that and just begin blending it back just blend it back this is one of the nicest simplest ways I've ever seen to make some very effective little seascapes very effective see there just think about angles and and how the water would play through there there we go but look how this color just jumps alive these black care businesses are some of the most beautiful beautiful effects that I've ever seen shoot I won't do that again maybe there's another one we over here we over here maybe this one here is just a wet spot in the sand it's not as not as much water here just some foam that's laying out here there we go but by pulling that down you have you already have your reflection there this is lazy man's way to paint a little bit of white blue yellow ochre since we have that dark sand on the canvas just by blending that in gives us some instance sand there and if you want to make that look wet just grab a little of it pull down go across it'll make the little make little shimmers in there okay back to paint thinner on the liner brush a little bit of color and you can just go in here and put all kinds of beautiful little details let's go up top here I want to put some in here too you can just put all kinds of little things little say all kinds of little doers happening fall into following the basic angles of the wave it's most important there comes one right over the top but these little details that's what will make your painting special there we go can no tropical looking seascape would be complete without a happy little palm tree let's go right into the black street Oh midnight black I reach up here and grab a little Van Dyck Brown put with it black and brown or brown and black whatever maybe we'll have a maybe this is your bravery test right there right there let's give him a friend friend lives right there now we need something for all that to sit on maybe there's a little projection right out here and just use a fan brush whatever you got handy whatever you got handy big brush fan brush it doesn't matter all we're doing here is just maybe there's some little green things living out here there okay take a little white a little yellow a little SAP green mix it together a nice sparkly little green color just put a few little highlights here and there on some of those little thanks think about little individual bushes that live in here right around his foots a little bit of brown comes right out like there and we can take on this palm tree pull a little bit to the side that'll just make it give it a little more character a little white on the brush here very little just enough to make it look round and let's go into our black with the liner brush with paint thinner on it so it's very very thin very thin okay let's go up here I begin thinking about how your palm lamps are going to hang off we can put in just some just basic ideas wherever you want looks like my umbrella alright maybe it was a bad year for palm trees we'll just leave them like it seagulls ate all the leaves right off of there we are and that's just to give you a basic idea of where you want to be should just grab a fan brush I'm going to dip the brush into paint thinner I want this paint to be very thin then we were right into the midnight black but see how thin that is it will literally run literally run if you're not careful okay now then again thinking about where you want to beautiful leaves on this palm grab it just give it a little downward pull say maybe this one comes over like so shoot a little something on the other side look at there say these are one of the simplest kinds of trees to make very very easy maybe there's some things over on the other side like so a little doers out here wherever you want them is your palm tree so you can do anything with it that you want to take a little set green and just come back and lay in a touch of highlight just disappear in there just to make it stand out okay good good I know you can do it just wherever you want these there is one but armed with this information before you can do some of the most beautiful seascapes but try these black canvasses I think you will find them exciting not only to yourself but to anybody that watches your paint as I mentioned earlier you know don't tell anybody that you've put all the color the transparent color on top of the black gesso and when you start applying that white on there these beautiful things will happen and people will absolutely think you're magician so I think we'll call that one finished from all of us here happy painting and God bless you production of this
