hi I'm certainly glad you could join me a date you got your paints out and ready to a fantastic painting with me good tell you what let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that limit eight but I've already get done up here we have our standard old canvas and I've covered it with a thin coat of liquid clear and let me repeat one word in there thin you need this then this coat of this so that you can put on there just a very very small amount one one jar of this probably last you the rest of your life and let's do something a little different today I'm gonna start off with the old two-inch brush and go into the least little touch of phthalo blue we're gonna make a sky with mostly transparent colors like you really enjoy that but the least least little mount let's go right up here maybe just put a little touch of blue right in here now when we have this liquid clear underneath color just like sparkles especially this transparent color so pretty there we go just little little touch of blue and while I have it on with brush like I'll do out let's do a little winter scene today so you'll have some snow down here so I'll just put some of these colors right down on there without cleaning the brush I'm gonna pick up the least least little amount of alizarin crimson and just tap it into the bristles just like so okay now that maybe here and there and I'm applying very very little pressure very little pressure just barely caress the canvas you know where these colors come together don't fight that and don't don't keep blending it let them come together and it makes all kinds of beautiful effects fine so I don't know let's go into the least least little touch of the dark Sienna just the least little touch we really warm this guy up maybe rather than here but have a little bit of that and when you're doing your painting pick out the colors that you like you don't necessarily have to use what I've used here I just want to show you how to do it and back to the old palette take a little bit of phthalo blue reach up here and grab a little little tiny touch of alizarin crimson so we have crimson and blue and just mix these on the brush proportionately more crimson and blue the blue is many times more stronger and maybe right up in here just put in a little bit of that but don't over mix your color want this to be a very soft but colorful sky just a nice little winter day all of the colors that we've used so far are very transparent we could put a little that wherever you want it down in here this is a good place to clean off your brush okay now that I want to add the least little touch more of color right up at the top own it a little bit darker so same color just lavender and right up in here just so there's a little variation in color this guy don't want it to be too too light there now let's start with titanium white and titanium white as you know is a very opaque color so I'm gonna just put a little of the white right on the brush and all this time I have yet to wash the brush these are the kind of paintings that I like I'm lazy I don't like to wash your brush okay now then we can go in here and just here and there again adding a little touch of opaque color just and angles now become very important if you want to create the illusion of a sky just got a little bit of life in it once again don't overwork this don't overwork it put it in blend it a little bit and leave it alone and we don't want to kill all these beautiful transparent areas that you made in here cuz here there would make this painting special and you'll like them you're like a bit maybe right in here let's see how that all comes together and it's working with transparent and opaque colors opaque I just made you can't see through it and that easy you have a very effective striking sky okay now we can have some fun as I say we're gonna do a little winter scene today so let's put some little trees back in the background I will use the old round brush for that I like it it's nice for making distant trees and go to start out with a little bit of black and reach over here and I get a little touch of the blue a little Venn diagram whatever whatever dark sienna we just mix them on there we don't want a lot of color on the brush and tap it firmly just really tap it so you can see how hard the brush is bending there tap firmly let's go up here now then you have to make your first big decision where does your little trees live in your world now just take a circle tapping and I like to start at the base of these trees and tap upward that way it's darker at the bottom than it is at the top see you can see how the brush is bending and mostly using the top bristles and that's what creates all those nice little fluffy leafy areas out here and all we're looking for at this point are just from very basic little shapes very basic these are far far away trees I had a little touch more of the dark sand and a little more brownish color now I like winter scenes that have a little warmth that I'm selective I like to use colors that are warm not just good old cold colors sometimes winter scenes can be so cold that they're distracting that make you uncomfortable to look at them I normally try to add a tiny little bit of warmth into my winter and then if you want to create the illusion of mist softness at the base of this you can do that let's do that with a two inch brush make sure your brush is nice and dry and you go up here in firmly using the top of the brush again tap just have your really striking it quite hard there we go but all I want to do is create mist at the base of this I don't want to create mist all the way up just at the base you can probably hear how hard I'm striking the canvas okay and very lightly very lightly just lift upward just lift that way and that easy you can you can create the illusion of little trees that are far off in the distance till they're really working very nice now let's start I'm going to take a titanium white on the 2 inch brush and you have to make another big decision now where did you snow live I have to make a decision and go right up in here and you decide where it lives and pull just pull allow it to pick up some of that color that you made your trees out of that ends up being shadows and be very pretty see how that it just glides right over that liquid clear another little trick that really make your painting more interesting maybe you want to create the illusion of a little more distance in here put a first layer of snow then go back I'm just going to use some Van Dyck Brown on the round brush in dark sienna now there I want to put another layer of little bushy trees but come outward coming see the snow is behind that now push that back and it'll create a whole nother plane in your painting and you can do as many or as few of those as you want the more you do the more depth you'll have in your painting and then come up here see there and lay some snow under that and automatically now you have several planes in that sneaky huh these little things are what makes your painting interesting now down here see right in here we wipe some of that blue off our brush don't kill all that let it let it stay there it's very pretty really very nice can it maybe we want to change an angle here all you have to do is change the angle of your snow and you can push all that back bad easy did you know that you had had much power you could move snow screed trees anything you want this piece of canvas you have unlimited power absolutely unlimited power and we're using these big old brushes and she didn't take but a minute to to fill it up and to do your painting I used to agonize over paintings for months now now I just enjoyable but see already you have a nice little area here that could be a field of snow and be a nice place for the little bunny rabbit to live now we could take our knife and scrape through make a few little sticks and twigs back here just here in there don't want too many but a few would show through and all you're doing is taking the point of the knife scraping them in wherever you think they should live that's where they ought to be okay and then with a fan brush you can come right up in here let me put a little white on there and grab some of this dark color and now then begin working it in here and just begin pulling some of that color down in I hit a little color to the fan brush I want to get a little bit of that color into the snow there and just let it sneak back in there you can make all kinds of little recesses and just happy little places in there drop them in okay now that I think in my world there some little trees live there so let's do that take the number two script liner brush I'm going right into Van Dyck Brown and I've dipped the brush into paint thinner so I'll make this paint as thin as ink almost like water see how thin and turning that brush when you take it off the palette how to pull it to it and I assure our point turn it and it comes very sharp okay now maybe back in here there's all kind of happy little trees that live there they go all kinds little trees now if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little bit more of the paint thinner dad comes all kinds of little things okay add a little more thinner to my brush there's one and wherever you want him to be weird there and as many or as few as you want now let's skip the little space it may be down here yep you're right lose another little tree we don't want him over there to get along me and then we need some limbs on that tree they're so easy those are to make and you can just keep on and on and on you can put a lot of detail in there just hundreds of little limbs and just keep going into your tree it's like you want it to be maybe another one right there but see all these different layers of trees help create the illusion of distance and it really makes you painting much more interesting there we go okay and you can take the old fan brush and just sort of clean up his foots a little bit and blend it right into the snow add a little bit of the liquid clear go it into some titanium white maybe maybe we want to show maybe there's a little stone under the snow right there something something that causes a Petrosian a bump say and then DZ you can drop the thread in anywhere you you use this liquid clear when it dries it'll have a sheen to it it'll look like it'll look like it's been glazed so very very nice effect tell you what let's do let's have a happy little bar and back here I like it and one of the easiest ways is just take your knife and sort of scrape out a basic shape to give yourself an idea of where you want it and to lay out your perspective and to remove any excess paint see that easy you have a very general idea of where you want this rascal of it maybe he'll maybe we'll put a little out here like that however and then we can start off with just titanium white we can sort of outline this decide where you want it to live and do like that and then bring your paint in that's probably the easiest way to get a nice smooth edge there sometimes when you get my age you get a little shaky you need all the help you can get there then we want a corresponding angle on the other side because it'd be snow on the other when they have the roof say that like so bring it right down and then we need to put some boards in that old barn use some Van Dyck Brown touch of dark sienna hold it out very flap glad you can get it and cut you off a little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife now we can go in here and we create the overhang if a little that white gets in there it makes it look like little boards and then you have to decide how tall he is you have to make all kind of big decisions there he goes see ya bad easy can't have it okay we have the other side over here like that and we said there was going to be a little on this part so just take the white and come right out like so there he goes there and once again we need some boards underneath there let me clean off my knife and we'll put some sides in front right held a little shed okay now with a knife you can sort of take and clean up the bottom of it you have to make the decision here where you want it to be I think we're gonna have a little snowbank it comes around like a pap add it take a little dark sienna some white mix them together cut off that little roll of pain again okay now there let's just go up here and just sort of touch give it a little pull just a little side words pull make it look like old boards and leave some cracks this is an old barn it's old and it's tired and winters been rough on it okay and then we can come right along here just drop them in now the other side we just add some Van Dyck Brown and make this side much darker much darker and then once again you just take your knife and do a cabin ectomy you just take off whatever you don't want okay now we need a we need a way to get into this old barn so let's build us a door the straight old Van Dyck Brown decide where the door is going to be and just pull it down soup see there and that easy that easy you've got a door in there take a touch of white maybe there's a little white right around here firm up the edges a little bit of dark this is just Van Dyke Brown and you're going to really increase the illusion of old boards here just by touching and we'll take off all that excess paint now back to a fan will dip into the into the liquid clear into titanium white load the brush full of paint a lot of pain okay now they're just bring some snow right down there I kept and some right along this little side here right over here try to pick up a little bit of that dark so we can create the illusion of a shadow we want a shadow over here yeah then we can just bring all this together winter scenes are very nice and they're very easy to paint this liquid clear you'll find is fantastic for doing snow or sand dunes sand dunes are done basically the same way okay let's go back to the liner brush here and I'll go back into some Van Dyck Brown then the paint down maybe there's a maybe there's a happy little fence that's right there and all you have to do we let it go right over do like it see and all you got to do that just put a few little rails in there but let it get smaller and smaller as it goes off in the distance maybe it comes down here and it'll help give the illusion of distance to your fence okay and we can put a little bit of snow around his foots that easy okay and then I've got several fan brushes going I'm going to take a little bit of the brown and maybe somewhere in here maybe there's some patches where the the snow is sort of melted you can see a little bit of dirt hair in there just wherever and also maybe here and there this maybe there's a happy little Bush it still still there it's all dead but if poke enough out of the stove this whole farmer he took care of this land like I do I'm heating he's not a good grass cutter maybe there's some more right in here whatever you want wherever you want just push upward on the fan brush this is just fan deck brown and dark sienna shooter had so much fun let's put some over here maybe there's one back in there just sort of let it follow the lay of the land and true can get carried away with these they're a lot of fun I'll put one here too now there with our fan brush that has the liquid clear and the titanium white on it we can go right up in here and grab ahold of these and work them lend them out just bring everything together like so see how easy that is and it really just sort of brings everything together cleans up the bottoms of all these little grassy areas and makes your painting so much more interesting right in there okay back to my liner brush I'm gonna go right into the Van Dyck Brown again just load the brush flow and let's have maybe there's a happy little tree that lives over here we don't want this side left out wherever in your world you put as many or as few trees as you want wherever you want wherever I tell you want us to sort of look at it and decide oh there's another tree those right there he's a little bigger cause he's closer to you then drop in a few little limbs branches little arms on a tree cat and give him kind of give him some arms little birds have to have a place to sit there there we go little more the thinner and you can put a couple little ones here in there okay shootin trees is so much fun let's get crazy I'll take the old fan brush here go right into a big bunch of the Van Dyck Brown really load that brush full that has come right about here soon we're gonna check you out for bravery today let's just drop one right in there and maybe he's got a little friend it lives right here beside him yeah that was your bravery test sometimes it's hard to get up enough nerve to to drop in a big tree right over everything that you've painted but do it just to enjoy it but in your painting if you don't want to tree there don't put one there just want to give you some options there we go we make this one look like old birch tree now I've mentioned in other shows if if I paint trees it are not like the trees in your area change them make them so they look like a trees that live will you do pink back to our liner brush right into some Van Dyke Brown and let's put some let's put some happy little lambs out here on this tree then paint a lot of thinner in there see how you see those are they just sort of flow right on there and you decide which trees in front and which ones behind all these big decisions and have some of the branches come across the trunk you don't want them just all coming out from the side that sometime come right across the trunk it'll help give you tree more dimension more shape much more pleasing when it's finished and it'll make you happier and I really want these paintings to make you happy and I want you to enjoy painting along with us we get so many cards and letters and people all over the country that experiencing fantastic success and that makes it all worthwhile there we go st. just as many or as few as you want wherever you want them and that really gives dimension to your painting it helps push everything back and we put a few little few little things living right in here say however me I'll take a little bit of red and we'll sign this painting I think it's about finished and I hope you've enjoyed it spent a lot of fun painting with you today give this liquid clear try and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless we'll see you next time Oh Oh haha Oh Oh
