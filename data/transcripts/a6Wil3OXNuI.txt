across the screen that you need to do this painting at home with me and they'll come across as usual in the same orders I have them on the palette starting with the white and working around while they're doing that that's going up here in the canvas and talked a little bit I'll tell you what I like to share things with you I've got to show you a picture of the youngest painter that I have met lately and this is this is William and William I met in Springfield Missouri he's four years old and he is fantastic painter he brought his picture and let me see it and certainly glad to have William working with us now the canvas is an 18 by 24 and I've completely covered it with a thin even coat of the liquid white so it's all slick and it's ready to go you let's do it let's start out today with a least little touch least a little touch of CAD yellow into the large brush just tap a little color in there okay and you have to make a decision right off today where's your horizon gonna be let's make it right about here let's do it such a beautiful day let's do a fantastic bright shiny painting today ones it'll make you happy a little bit of yellow in there let it blend with a liquid white now without cleaning the brush I'm going back into yellow ochre just tap a little bit of the yellow ochre right into the same little dirty brush okay now right above the yellow ad okay just like so and they didn't blend right and also so easy that is now without cleaning the brush I'm going into a touch of bright red chest a touch it's very very strong you know it'll eat up your whole world and one heart beat right along here Oh add a little touch of me where I just sort of let it play on the out through here wherever well let it have fun now with what little is left on the brush I'm just gonna mix it with a little bit of a liquid white on the canvas it just makes sort of a nice little peachy color right here yeah very lightly we can blend all this together so we have layers of cover okay same old dirty brush I had a little titanium white then we'll go right here I want this area right in here to be nice and bright and shiny so I'm gonna add just straight titanium white and work it in now when this is done for this area would be bright and shinies it doesn't look shiny now because it suggests a light background we're gonna put some dark colors in there and then it'll happen okay let's take us a a little bit of alizarin crimson and some phthalo blue alizarin crimson a little blue proportionately we need much more crimson than blue just mix it on the brush let's go right back up in here yeah this is to make a nice lavender color and I'm just gonna go right around in here and begin spinning in just the indication of some happy little cloud shapes here and there beautiful little colors happening here just sort of work them in just mix them in blend them there make all kinds of little things just happen don't kill all this pink leave some of it in there so it shines through the clouds okay a little touch more maybe there's a happy little cloud that just sort of boom there he comes we'll try it out in there wherever you want yeah I'm gonna add a little bit more than a little blue still haven't cleaned the brushes and in with this phthalo blue I'll put a little bit of blue right up here at the top like so maybe a little touch right there just to bring us all together yeah they have time to clean the brush that's the fun part odorless paint thinner just shake off the excess and you've totally redecorate the studio and at home I suggest you get your brush beater wrecked and put it in the bottom of a trash can so you don't change your whole decor in a matter of seconds now with a clean dry brush I'm gonna begin blending this entire sky together just very gently just sort of mix it up blend it blend little circular strokes crisscross strokes whatever it takes to make some nice effects just sort of look at your painting each painting is gonna be a little different never can copy the always individual look at all the beautiful things that are happening in this guy not a super way to make a fantastic sky very quickly and very easy nice to work myself to death try to create a sky like it it's easy it's very easy you can do it you could do it there we go we've had one dynamites guy beautiful beautiful sky now you can also see how that light area just sort of jumps out at you after you put the dark off clean the brush meet the devil out of it and we're ready tell you what let's play a little bit with a little oval brush and I'm gonna go right in here let's take some let's take some alizarin crimson a little bit of black and some brown listen dark sand out there - what the heck little touch of white just lighten up so we can see what we have that's a nice color clean the knife off I just clean the knife on paper towels if you wonder where I'm going over there okay this is the little oval brush see it's around there you see it it's around okay load a little paint on it let's have a little footy Hill back here in the distance somewhere and all I'm gonna do just take this brush and tap see look at all the little looks like little treetops far far away just hundreds of them that quick well that's sneaky huh now left a little bit this yellow underneath because I want to I want to blend it out and create a mist and I want the mist to have sort of a yellowish hue to it so it looks like there's light playing through there now with a large brush I'm just going to tap the base of this don't touch the top just the base just heavy okay very lightly very lightly just lift it up blend it together if I see the soft nice misty area written into here that's what will help create the illusion of distance I'm gonna get a little further along in the painting MANET kind of make some big decisions we'll just use that same old color same old color I was what do we have there we had a lizard crimson so Van Dyck Brown some dark Sienna whatever you throw a little black in there too if you want to all we're looking for now it is a nice darkish color to laid out for a base coat and then on top of that we'll put a light color just tap the brush in there okay it's great okay now you have to make big decisions let's start creating some landmasses in here all you do just touch and tap just tap it down right it's either that easy that easy we can create a nice little land area back here you don't want to kill this misty area this little misty area between the dark Kanna and the foothill is the only thing you have to separate you need to say that treasure it it's your good friend good good friend yeah I'll just use the same old dirty brush what the heck I'm lazy don't like to clean brushes take a little yellow look kid yellow put a SAP green would jump over here and get some yellow ochre - what the heck it doesn't matter tap the brush tap it case go right up here now then let's put some little highlights you need that dark in order to make that light show see there look at that get back you make beautiful soft little grassy areas it's that easy easy just tap on you following the lay of the land this is where you begin creating the shape of your land so it's very important that you pay attention to the angles here and that easy you have a plane back you're all finished up tell you what I won't get a new brush I'll take the same color we'll use some lizard crimson some black dark Sienna Van Dyke Brown throw a little SAP greener to what the heck along this dark that's a big thing tap the brush Kenny now we have to make another big decision maybe there's another plane or another layer of land it comes right down in front of that one that see when you have this much power you have to make decisions make decisions you can move mountains and rivers all we're doing here is applying the dark sorta Lydell show there we go it's that easy that his in reality you could put this on with a paint roller all you're doing is putting on dark for a base coat it's gonna be the shadows it'll be the shadows and all the little grassy areas here you're tapping quite firmly here just really this is where you take out all your hostilities this is it's a better than one home and arguing with your spouse or kicking the dogs or whatever there we go young fellow I showed you is beginning to show he's a painter anything as I say I met him in Springfield Missouri we we did a show there for the PBS station and he came to see us fantastic young man we met so many super people they're looking forward to going back in the near future okay I just got carried away here talking and just cover up the whole campus why not let's just cover up the whole campus it didn't make any difference there okay just tap see I like to leave some of these light areas and here's a reason I've tap instead of just painting all this because some of these the light areas will show through and it makes just makes nice looking places Kenny tell you what tell you what miss do let's take let's use table round brush we'll have some fun we'll take the round brush and go right into some Van Dyck Brown a little touch of the dark sienna and all I'm doing is tapping very firmly to load it just have let's go right up here maybe there's a little clump of trees I live right in here you live right in there I start at the bottom and work up sort of pick up the liquid Whitehead gets lighter and lighter in value as it works up with because more lights come shine through these limbs and everything up here much more light little touch it more to paint maybe there's a happy tree right there we don't know just wherever wherever you want a little tree to live in your world that's the right place for it that is the right place already you got the basic shape there's some nice little trees yeah let's take a whole script liner brush and I'll just use something I'll just use some paint thinner and go right into the brown we want to thin this paint down till it's a very thin turn the brush turn it pull it out that brings it to a nice short point let's go up here now then we need a few tree trunks in here there we go now if your paint does not flow add a little more of the paint thinner to it but then paint will stick to a thick paint maybe there's a few out in here at home you have unlimited time you can just you can do a much better job you can put all kinds of details in here and loop tree branches and limbs and the squirrel or two hair in there oh you can get crazy this is where a little bunny rabbit hides out he's my friend I'm going back into the brown right now it looks like all the all the foliage is on the back of the tree I want some on this side too so using the same color hearing there I'm just gonna tap in a little foliage on this side of the tree see that way doesn't look like it's all on the other side of the tree like somebody took a big razor blade you touch a tree and tune it if I love on the floor there we go that easy and then this get us let's get us a big fan brush I'm gonna take some black Prussian blue SAP green just a good dark color here mix that up clean knife let's take the old fan brush and load it full of paint a lot of paint just really fill it up all right look at that a lot of paint in there okay let's go up here and maybe there's a happy little evergreen tree who lives right there right there we don't have anything but happy trees just work back and forth I see that's how this dark color shows up against that light mmm the contrast there is beautiful just what really jumps out at you it really jumps out so it makes your painting beautiful can I tell you what let's do let's make a whole clump of trees we you know 100 tree laying up here lonely you get sad and start crying nothing worse than an unhappy tree I had one bite me one time there's a little there's one right here gotta have a place for the little birds to sit they'd like to hide in these kind of trees they can hide in there and the hawks and the stuff can't see you and you sort of have to make a decision here how many trees you want in your world tell you what maybe there's a tiny one here then it won't quit I just I get carried away these trees are so much fun just put a little one right there I'm going back to the old brush that has some of the yellows and greens on it that we were using to make the little grassy areas let's tap a little more of that color in there go ahead up here I want to create the illusion of a little bit there see nice soft little area moving let it pick up some of this dark color look at there just let it work right on out all you have to do here is just tap no big deal be easy to do say hey you can push those trees or anything and when they get darker and darker darker back in here there's a lot of shadow over here so don't add any new color just use that same little dark color and let it pick up all the dark and just fade right into nothing see how soft you can do it maybe there's a nice little thing right there okay let's have some fun let's take the knife I'm gonna use some dark Sienna a little bit of white pull it out flat cut across to get that little roll of paint okay yeah then let's go right up here let's just put the indication a little tree trunk put one in there do wherever you want we don't know how many trees live back here in this club this is a family and they're happy back here those arms and sticks and twigs tell you what must do let's use our oval brush I'm going to some yellow yellow yellow some SAP green pull that brush through there wiglet bring it to a nice sharp edge okay let's go right back up here yeah then let's come right down here and let's just put oh look at that look at that look at all the little only this little brush is just fantastic for making thousands of little lambs they're just the hair they go see look at all those little devils and this brush being oval they're sort of roundish it makes it it gives its shape give it some character put someone this with doing him get upset because he doesn't have any I hope you can see all the little details that brush makes there we go all right over here it goes and you can put as many as you want on there okay it's such a nice little area tell you what let's build a house back here shoot let's take some Van Dyke Brown on pull it out grab us some other night you had to make a big decision maybe the house lives right there see right in front of our tree but I don't yeah we'll come over here that's my other side to roof just like building a house they really go just lay in a nice base color a dark color there do you see ya then I need a front honey in your world you look around you see what kind of house you want and you

make a little noise I didn't work didn't see there CSO roof or he's like me he's old and had a rough life the rains coming through on him man and let's take some light a little bit of the dark sienna there very good nice touch no pressure old wood no pressure just like can we put snow on the mountains no pressure I like to teach people to put snow on the mountains cuz if you can do that then all this other other stuff for the knife becomes a very easy it's the best way to make friends with that knife sometimes it it's neat to take out a tiny bit of a yellow oh yeah one put in there see that neat little yellow ocher make it look old and tired now on the other side very dark very dark over here and doing just a little indication yeah then I'll take up just a point of the knife and will this make some old boards in here just by pulling down look at that oh I wished it was that easy to build a house there we go oh we got two hole she had Nelligan so we can chop it up and get our
