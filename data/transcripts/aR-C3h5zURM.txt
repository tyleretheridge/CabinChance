hi I'm certainly glad you could join me a date you ready to another fantastic painting with me cut get your paints out a big glass of iced tea and let's do it let's start off and hadn't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this painting with me and they'll come across as usual in the same orders I have them on the pallid so I've done something a little different today let's go up here and talk about it today I've covered the old canvas well maybe we can call this liquid grey I've taken liquid black and liquid white and about equal proportions and just cover the outside of it with this gray color and then a little liquid white in the center and blend it together I'm going to have a lot of dark I think today in this painting so by putting this grey color on here it it already gives you some of your dark values mixture makes your painting life a whole lot easier so let's take off and have some fun mmm to start today with that tiniest little touch of yellow ocher tiniest little amount okay let's go right up here and maybe up in here I'm just gonna lay in a little bit of yellow just here and there I don't want much color I want to have a little bright spot up here in the sky where the lights coming through and that's what that's what this will end up being so that's about all we need just a tiniest little touch of color it mixes with the liquid white or liquid gray whatever we want to call it you can mix your own at home no big problem take a little black and white but equal proportions there T and then we'll take a little black little black little little touch of the a little blue just sort of mix them together on the brush here more black than blue okay and let's go right up in here and just begin putting in a little bit of color here and let it work down toward that light spot much much more black and blue so it's sort of really it really should be a blue gray color here is what I'm looking for but in your world sort of look around and see if that's the colour you want if not change it change it they're still using little crisscross strokes just little X's as in school a teacher used to grade my paper this way I think I've mentioned that another series once you just run right over here make X's everywhere I'll get the least little touch of alizarin crimson nice little touch and we're still mixing all this on the brush jannis let it sort of mix together and make a happy little lavender color Tiny's little touch of crimson there's not much color on here there okay okay I've got several brushes going here so let me get a nice clean one and I'm going to take and begin blending this a little bit still using little tiny criss-cross strokes just to feather the edges out and bring it all together start in the light area and work outward work outward from the light area because you don't want to pull that dark color down into your light you lose it off it'll he'll go right away and leave you right away and leave you now you can pick up a little that dark C and just tap it back in and make all kinds of little things happening in here there this is one of the easiest nicest ways to make a super super effective sky super effective sky I know we're never interested in that happy book but if you're selling paintings this kind of sky will really sell people love them absolutely love them all right we wash that brush out any we wash our brushes with odorless tanner shake them off this is meet the devil out of all right this makes a little background trees here take a little bit of black little black little dark sienna a little band Ike mostly the Browns though a little touch of blue in there - what - heck okay just tap the brush now that you have to make a big decision here where some little background trees live I'm using just the corner of the brush and tapping downward hope you can see that just tap downward start at the bottom and work up word say we want to make some little some little basic tree shapes far back in the distance here just very basic little shapes there I'm not looking for a lot of detail just just very basically take let's have some water under here just put a little phthalo blue on the brush and you come right into here look at there that easy that easy we'll put in a little bit of water little more than a blue shoe maybe the water is going to be I don't know where it's gonna be exactly we're gonna have water we'll just put it where we want it there be a little over in here okay that's just a little sable blue right um old dirty brush so all the colors have mixed together you sort of have a sort of a bluish gray very nice color okay maybe I'll take one let's just reflect some of these trees right there that's going to be water will just reflect some right down in here like so now with our two-inch brush grab it and just pull downward pull straight downward like so there we go pull it down pull it down straight down and go lightly across and we have instant reflections okay shoot us go in so good listen let's have some more fun here Oh same old dirty brush I'm lazy they don't want clean brushes I'm going to take a little touch it a little blue little lizard crimson a little white into it make a nice lavender sort of to the reddish side though like so let's go ahead up here now maybe maybe there's a little light playing right out here on some of these little little bushes alright so add the least little touch of the liquid white here I want it to be a little bit thinner so it'll stick easier wow that's nice if your paint won't stick had a little touch of liquid white or a little bit of a paint thinner doesn't take much though sure didn't take much just where you think light would strike these little bushes on there's another one right there that's a pretty one wherever you want them there's one at this old big one here we don't have left out that easy just use the big old two-inch brush now you can use you one inch brush one-inch brush works very nice for this too but you can use one inch two inch whatever let's take a little bit of Van Dyck Brown pull it out flat cut across get our little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife we'll come right underneath here and very firmly let's just put it in the indication of a little bit of land into here this is gonna be far away so I'm not I'm not too worried about a lot of detail well these are some nice woods back incest this is where little bunny rabbit lives back here in the squirrel hold them little fellers I like all those little creatures having friends okay tell you what we can go right into some brown bin bag brown some black dark sienna a little lot of paint in the brush and maybe over here live some trees sure does now and here all we're doing is tapping downward same way this is where you have to start making some big decisions where does all you artists all your little trees live maybe right down through here I don't know wherever you want comes right on out through here little more dark sienna now I'm going to start adding dark sienna and yellow ochre I want to get lighter and lighter as it works its way on up here maybe even here in there little touch of alizarin crimson in there too crimson yellow ochre dark sienna now begin thinking about some nice big tree branches that are hanging out here where do you want them where do you want so lizard crimson yellow ochre dark sienna all these nice warm colors very warm very pleasant and toward the base you want to be darker darker darker darker there we go think pickled limbs hanging out and now we go back to some black and brown sap green little SAP green in it too let's just have this come let's go right over here what the heck whatever you want well we just going crazy here in fact we just fell all that up of color I gotta be pretty right hmm but you see how easy it is to lay in a tremendous amount of color very easily when you're using a big Brush all you gotta do is just sort of drop it in wherever you wherever you think it should be that's where it'll be Browns and black screens all those little colors to new heights why are the Browns and maybe maybe a pair comes yeah there it is see right here let's have another tree you can have as many or as few trees as you want in your world all you do is just get an idea in your mind and drop it in let's have a bigger one here it comes right on open it lives up here in the sky like so do you everything you could paint a picture that fast you can you really can same old colors black brown little SAP green here in there shoot if I'm gonna care if I'm gonna cover up the whole canvas and that's all right that's no biggie you can still cover it all up and and still go back and put all kinds of little watery things in there it still work you have to start making some decisions here where did you lose your big ol let's live out here I want a big tree over here big tree tell you what we said let's go have water in here so make make a decision where does your water live and start pulling it down wherever you want water you just pull down and create reflection see there and you have instant water maybe there's a little Peninsula right out here I need a little more color there not quite enough color right there and you pull that straight down okay and then go across that easy you can make most fantastic reflections can we'll take a touch liquid white on my knife and cut across it back in here I will put just the indication of a little water line push that we a backer and yet literally literally just cutting right into the right into the fabric okay and find out fan brush here there's one let's go into some Van Dyck Brown and I crown a little dark sienna what the heck okay now then let's put us a tree trunk carry there maybe there's a trunk it lives yes there is right in that tree and of course this whole tree hey don't be left out he needs a a nice trunk to hold him up straight shoot maybe a tree so big it takes two who knows who knows let's go on the other side over here over here and all this there's got to be a got to be some trees happening in there some nice strong trunks to hold all that up see there wherever you think they should be and don't make them all just Street they're not all going to being telephone poles trees grow every which way and sometimes you can just see little parts of trees because the leaves have covered it up back in there you can make little limbs or a probably an easier way to make lenses put some paint thinner on the liner brush and we want to we want to mix a little brown here till it's absolutely like ink it flows it's very thin very then turn it and brush pull it to a nice sharp point a lot of paint and then you can go up in here we put all kinds of little limbs back in here just wherever you think it should be all kinds of little details this is where the squirrels are going to play I call squirrels tree urchins for lack of a better word I think when I was a kid I must have had every kind of pet imaginable and when the earlier series I told the story about a pet snake I had that kept for a long time I lived in Florida so I had access to a lot of creatures but I had a pet snake man he got out of the cage and was lost in a house for a long time my mother got up went to the bathroom one night he was in there and secured her she still yells at me about that and I spent 30 years okay now then let's take get an old two-inch brush here don't you tell her I told you a story about the snakes you get me a little bit of yellow ocher CAD yellow just mixed together shoot and grab a little to end you know just tap the brush firmly see tap it okay maybe I'm going to reach right up here and get a touch of the dark Sienna to like it there grab a little white and put in there mmm nice color I can let's go up to the canvas add it begin deciding here or all these little little leaves and the tree branches live and you just use the corner of the two-inch brush just the corner if you had trouble making the stick add a little bit of a paint thinner or the liquid white either one either one it's up to you the liquid white naturally will make it a little bit a little bit brighter paint thinner won't change the color lise little touch though there may be say let some of these come over and think about shapes here don't just do this at random sort of think about individual shapes and all the little things I want to add a little touch a bright red to that to shooting Sparkle these Rascals up in here well that's nice that's nice I can see all kinds little leaves living back in here nice be a nice place for a screw there whatever you want I can't read this color put a little bit out in there - there and you can just go on and on and off make all kinds of pretty little things okay over here on this side I need something for a touch of the liquid white - there maybe just a little more what then is paint down so it'll stick a little easier so I added a small amount of liquid white and you can do this you can do this with a one-inch brush or two-inch brush there we go but once again I can't say it enough look at form and shape when you treat don't just throw me at random you won't be happy with them if you do think about form like what makes that tree an individual put a little highlight right out here make you Sparkle out here in the Sun J maybe this old tree here you need some too just the corner the brush that's all you're using there just layer after layer it's unbelievable what you can do with the big breasts I think what you could do with a smaller one Tang add the least little touch maybe of SAP green here and there maybe down in here shoot maybe there's just all kind of little things happening down in here - still using only the corner of the brush Oh me the corner just wherever you think it should be some little little sparklers here wherever maybe let's go all the way over here maybe back in here let's paint in some woods some deep but dark areas be berries Arif took a little to midnight black and mixed it with yellow to make a very dark dark green leave a little bit of those dark hedges in there don't kill all those see there though but still working layers here always working in layers and and work down the hill here think about the lay of the land stare counts there Koons right down there tell you what let's get crazy today if you if you had something like it you need a little path so you could go from here to there so let's go to there let's start at there and let's just bring it restate on a cross to hear Van Dyke Brown Saul I'm using here just Van Dyke Brown right on across now we take some white right a little bit of dark sienna and with that let's just add the least least little touches some highlights here just make it stand out a little look at there see that easy you can make a happy little path you can you can look at that that'd be a super place to go in fiction have fun okay now then back to our color and we can come back in here and drop in a few little sparklers wherever we want them there maybe there's a little little peninsula right out here I can't like so and see all kinds of little banks just using the corner of the brush here all you have to do little green this is such a nice easy way to paint and it works so well thank you really enjoy it and you can do entire paintings using only this brush just a little 2 inch brush work on the lay of the land though I have it coming down the hill here like so okay let's put a little bit of a little bit of ground area right into this make a little Peninsula water goes in two or three places we don't know where all it goes here comes right on down little touch a highlight on that damn a little bit out here then you put just a happy little water line in there just sort of cleans up the edges brings it all together let's have some fun let's have some fun I'm gonna dip my brush right into a little touch of the liquid white go into some yellow mostly white a little bit of yellow here let's come right out in here let's get brave mm just gonna throw in some sparklers here just drop them in I say here we're gonna check you for bravery and then we have to have something for that to set up what's causing that well this is what's causing it I want a big old tree and I want those leaves those limbs that are bright and shiny to be on the other side so you put those in first and put the trunk over it and bacter liner brush the nice thin paint on it and we can put in just the indication here and there I have some big old limbs because I have something to hold all that Evan there that's something you can do it came in and let's come on back here I'm going to use a yellow yellow hooker CAD yellow yellow ochre and I'm gonna here and get some a little bit of bright red I reach up here get some white bought a color on the brush now then let's put some leaves on this big old tree they gotta be a little bit lighter so they stand out ma or good colors here back to that bright red like it okay now I spring these ride-on around come right on in front of the tree thing you want some nice leaves in front of the tree here too don't want them all behind I like these kind of paintings are very soft and it's sort of different than a lot of the paintings we've been doing in the past they're say slept in Rascals float around and maybe is a couple back in here we don't know exactly where all the limbs are there okay and we can take a little touch of brown and white and let's put just the indication of a little highlight on this tree wanting to but light striking down here his foots and maybe back in here just to make those shine a little bit maybe right here oh there's a nice little bright but they lifts right along the edge there you take pointed knife scraping a few little sticks twigs and you've got one fantastic painting done certainly help you enjoyed this a little different it'll really give you a lot of experience from all of us here happy painting and God bless you
