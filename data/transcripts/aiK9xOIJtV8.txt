(smooth jazz music) - Hi, I'm glad to see you again. And today, I hope you've
got your palette set up, and a big glass of iced tea there, and you're ready to paint along with me. And, I'm gonna have them
graphically run all the colors across the screen we'll use today to do this fantastic painting. While they're doing
that, let's get started and take off here. I've already covered the canvas with a thin, even coat of
magic white. And we'll start. And I'll go into a little
bit of alizarin crimson. Just a small amount. And
let's just go up here, and let's just play. Just here and there. Let's just drop in a little bit of color. Just drop in a little color. Now, use very little color on your brush. You can always add color, but it's... sometimes it's very difficult
to try to remove color off the canvas. So use very little color. We don't want to set the sky on fire. We just want a little pinkish
glow playing here and there. And without washing the brush I'll go right in to a small amount of thalo blue. Work it into the bristles, go here. Just making little criss-cross strokes. Don't kill all your pink. The blue is many, many times
stronger than the crimson, so don't kill all your pink. Just sort of fill up the areas in here. And then we'll come back and we'll blend all this together. Today, I thought we'd do a, a beautiful, beautiful
little soft, quiet painting. Very gentle, beautiful little painting. Hope you enjoy it. And while I've got blue on the brush, maybe we'll have a little bit of water, there it is. Just where we want it right in there. Thalo blue. It's a very bright, very pretty blue. Okay, now I'll wash my brush, get it all nice and clean, Ding! There we are. Now let's go back up in
here and very gently, we'll just just blend all this together. Now you don't wanna overblend it, if you overblend it, you'll
lose all your little pink here. 'Cause they'll go away and leave you. They'll just leave you. There. Okay. Blend it to about, about like that. Take the brush strokes out, and you have a very nice, and very effective little
sky that's easy to do. Okay, let's just keep using
the same old dirty brush. I'll go right into a little
bit of Van Dyke brown, a little burnt umber, Oh, we'll just mix it on
the brush just like so. Just pull it down through the color. There we go. Alright,
let's go up to the canvas. and let's put in some
happy little tree shapes. I'm just looking for
some basic shapes here, don't wanna a lot of detail. And all we're doing is just
sort of touching the canvas and there, just striking the canvas. Put in some beautiful little shapes. A little brown, a little burnt umber. Maybe there's another
one of those right there. Right there. See how easy those are to do? Just drop them in. And don't try to copy, just
exactly what I'm doing here. Let your imagination go. We don't use any patterns,
or do any tracing. Just let it go, let it happen, let it happen. That's what makes it
fun, is when you learn to create on canvas. That's when it's fun. And this is just background color. We're really not, we're
not worried a great deal about it at this point. We'll worry later when we start
putting all the highlights and that's when we separate
all these little individuals. Right now we just want some
very soft, quiet little trees. Very quiet. These are the kind of paintings that, that my mother likes, so maybe I'll just dedicate this one to my mommy. You know, I'm an old man, but I'm still, I'm still a mommy's boy
and I don't care who knows. She's my favorite lady in the whole world. So, this is her painting. This is for her. And a beautiful lady should
have a beautiful painting. Okay, okay, that easy. That easy, we've got some nice little background shapes. And that's just all we're
looking for right now, just very basic, very basic little shapes. Don't want a lot of work. Have fun, just drop it in. There. Already, we're beginning to
make out all kind of form, and we really haven't done anything. Then while we've got
this color going, shoot, let's just have some fun here, same color. And I'll just very quickly lay in some color right along here. and we don't care where it goes right now. We'll make all these decisions later. Just some dark, so when we start
putting some light in here, all kinds of beautiful
little things will happen. Bet you're sitting there saying, "He's pretty messed up this time," and you may be right. Okay, let's take our liner brush, and I'm gonna put a little
bit of paint thinner on it and go right into some of the same color where it mixed together. The Van Dyke brown and the burnt umber, and I've made the paint quite
thin with paint thinner. Okay. Now maybe there's, we'll go up in here, and we'll just put the indication of a few tree trunks here and there. And we're not looking still
for a great amount of detail. Just wherever you think some
limbs would show through, drop 'em in, drop 'em in. Drop 'em in. There. Just here and there, wherever, wherever. These are your trees, so you got to make the decisions where you want 'em. Okay, maybe we're not
really concerned with it just here and there. A few little things that happen and play. Now I'm going back and we'll get that same old dirty brush,
same old dirty brush. And let's go right into a little bit of, oh, this little cad yellow put some sap green into
it, that makes it pretty. Maybe a little yellow ochre. Just brush mix these colors, put 'em all together on the brush. You can just go up here. And maybe, maybe right here, a little bit of light
playing through there, just striking this tree. And all I'm doing is
just touching, tapping. There. That's all you need. Try a little Indian yellow. That's a beautiful color. Right there. Right there. There we go. And come right across these trunks, 'cause you don't see the entire trunk, There's leaves on this side. Don't forget that. You don't
always see the entire trunk. There's a little sap green added, and all this is done without
ever washing the brush. Just same old dirty brush. We can add a little bit of paint thinner. That'll make it stick a little easier. Get a little more green on the brush, maybe we'll go to this big old tree here. This one goes right off the canvas. Now when you're touching these, always pull toward the limb in the center, 'cause they all generate from that, they all come from that. So always go back to that. Pull your strokes toward
that trunk in the center. There's one right there, there
he is, I knew he was there. Bet you did, too. You did, too. You just wanted to see
if I was gonna get him. Sometimes I forget. A little of that yellow ochre and maybe go right in here. Wherever you want 'em. Just drop 'em in. See how easy these are? Really nothing to 'em, nothing to 'em. Here, here's one, right there. Let it sparkle in the sun. Less and less color as it comes down, so it gets darker and
darker automatically. That way you don't even
have to think about it, it just happens. Let's go to the other side over here. Maybe way back in here. Barely touching the canvas. Barely, barely touching the canvas. Okay, maybe, there he is, there he is, knew he was there. The canvas. Nice big bushy thing lives right there. You see, you don't have
to spend a lot of time planning this and drawing it
all out, worrying about it, and then trying to stay in the lines. Shoot. Make your own world, and make it while you paint. There. A little more of the yellow, maybe we'll just put a
little bright one right there that just stands out. You see you overlap these, you layer 'em. That's what creates the
illusion of distance, is all these different layers. That's what makes 'em pretty. Let's take a clean brush now, and I'm gonna gently tap right in here. Let that magic white work through and create a nice, soft misty area. Just come right on across. Very lightly, very lightly. Barely touch. Okay. Nice, soft, misty area back in there. Mmm-kay. That gives us a quick little background. Quick little background. Maybe we wanna add, maybe there's a, right here maybe there's a little tree that, he didn't have
any leaves left on him. Maybe, maybe he didn't make
it through last winter. You know, every year
there are some trees that doesn't make it. and they're part of nature. Don't avoid dead trees in your paintings. They're beautiful, and you see 'em in nature. So put 'em in your paintings, and make 'em look realistic, and they're a lot of fun. A lot of fun. Lot of fun. There. Okay. And you can put as many
limbs out here as you want. Just there. You can get carried away and spend all day just putting in all these
beautiful little limbs. And that should be enough. Give you an idea of how they're made, and you can have fun with 'em. So let's go in here, and
we'll take a little bit of the yellow and the green. All the different colors
of yellow and sap green, and they're all just mixed
on the brush right here. Just tapping, see? See there? Just tapping. Okay, let's go up to the canvas and gotta figure out
where the land is here. And the lay of the land is very important when you're doing this. So follow those angles. Decide where your land's at, and then the angles, they're very, very important. Very important. Can't stress that enough. Don't kill all this dark. You put the dark in here so this light would show up when you put it on. Got to have the dark in
there so the light shows. You know it's just like life, you have to you have a little sadness
in your life so you know when you have a happy time. If everything was happy you wouldn't know. You wouldn't know. But you have some sad times in your life and then when you have a happy time, then you know you're having a happy time. so it makes it fantastic. There. See how soft and gentle that is? And there's days when you
don't wanna be soft and gentle, you wanna do strong, almighty paintings. And then there's days
when you're in the mood to do very soft, quiet little paintings. So we try to show you
all the different ways and you have to make the decision. Okay, now let's take a clean brush here. I wanna start building
some reflections in here. Gotta make some decisions. Maybe the water goes right on around, like so. I'm gonna take a little bit of thelo blue and alizarin crimson, I'll
just mix it right on the brush, just a small, small amount. Oh, more crimson, I want it a little more
to the lavender hue. That's better. That's better. If you don't like it, you
change it. It's your world. Okay, you pull that straight down. It's most, most important that
you pull it straight down. Straight down, straight
down, straight down. Okay. Now very lightly, just brush across. (laughs) Instant water. Isn't that fantastic? Now maybe, let's play a little bit. Maybe you want it should reflect some of the light areas from the sky. so you go right in here. Here's a little bit of titanium white, and maybe there's some white color, shoot, wherever you want it, drop it in. See? See how easy that is? And you go back, and once again, pick up a little bit of
that, pull it straight down. You can do this until you get
it any way that you want it, if you wanna show clouds and all kind of things reflected in there. Go across, and that easy. That easy. See? Now you have a little
light area out here. Okay. I'm gonna add a
little bit of paint thinner on to my brush so the paint will stick a little easier. Then we can come back and
begin filling in some of this. Gotta make decisions. Where does this go? There it is, that's where it goes. Wherever you want it to go. Wherever, wherever. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Put a little green in it, and I'm just varying these
colors back and forth, the yellows and the greens. Just let 'em have fun, yellow ochre. Once in a while I'll add a
small amount of permanent red, permanent red is very strong
so be careful with it. Okay, let's take a fan brush now. Fan brush. Now go into a
little bit of Van Dyke brown, and a little burnt umber. And I just mix 'em on the brush here. Just a little, okay? Let's go right up here. and let's just scrub in a
little bit of land area. Maybe there's a little dirt
back in here, wherever. Wherever, wherever. Just a little. Goes right up, oh there it is, there it is, wherever. Have fun, let it happen. There it is, just let it go. Let it go. Okay, I'm gonna take a
small amount of yellow ochre with white on it. Yellow ochre and a little bit of white. Put a little, a little bit
of highlight here and there. Just a little highlight. And just let that sort of wander back. Now don't kill all the dark. Don't kill it all. Leave a little dark
showing here and there. Okay, there's a (mumbles) right there. And wherever you want it to go. Alright. Then we can clean
up some of these edges and we're ready to make
some more big decisions. I'm adding a little bit of
titanium white to my brush. Just a little white. Maybe
there's some sunlight that plays right there. Right there. So add a little white, makes that area stand out
like it's light hitting. Maybe it comes right on across
and hits on the other side. The same color, I've just
lightened the value a little so that it stands out, makes it look like sunlight
playing through there. Okay, I'll put a little Van Dyke brown and then go right into
all my greens and yellows. I want it to get darker
because I'm gonna do Ooooh, this. There we go. There we go. Messed it up now. Messed it up now. Let's think, just make a decision. Let it happen. Let it happen. Come right on across. Okay. Darker, darker, darker, darker. See? You just cover up
what you don't want. And you make your little pond,
whatever shape you want it. You're the creator, you can
do anything on this canvas, anything. Anything. Now we can put a little
highlight here and there. And I'm just tapping still. And a little bit of paint thinner, that'll make it stick a little easier. There. See there, how easy it sticks? If you need a firm paint underneath, or you can't do that. You'll become a mud mixer in a heartbeat. But you see, just by
touching and tapping here, how very soft and quiet you can make it. See? There we go. Alright, maybe, tell you what, let's play. Maybe same old dirty brush. Maybe there's a nice bush
that lives right here. That'll put a little more
depth into the painting. Give it another plane or two here. First, we'll put in some dark, and then we'll go back just using the same old dirty brush. Pick up a little bit of the light color, and highlight it. You need that dark underneath, then come back and highlight it. Tell you what, that's okay. I'll add a little Indian yellow to that so it stands out against that. And just let it go, wherever you want it. Mmm-kay. Let's have some fun today. Tell you what, let's do.
Let's build a huge tree here. I get a lot of letters saying, "I'm having trouble with trees," so I'm gonna show you how to make one. A big one. Let's take some Van Dyke brown, and pull this paint out very flat. Take the knife, cut across so there's a little bit of paint right out on the edge of the knife. Can you see it? There. See that little roll of paint?
Okay let's go to the canvas. Decide where you're gonna
have this big, huge tree. "He lives there," you say? Alright. Then, this is where he goes. And just touch the canvas. Touch the canvas. Touch, pull. Just like so. Maybe it goes all the way off the canvas. All the way off. And, then you have to
determine how thick he is. So just pull this, pull
it, pull it, pull it. Now, it'd really be better to pull from the opposite
direction, but if I do that, you're not gonna be able
to see what I'm doing. So I'll just do it this way and leave this side sort of ragged. But when you're doing it at home, turn the knife that way and pull it. That'll make that edge nice and smooth. Then maybe, tell you what, let's do. Let's make it even bigger, and maybe, maybe, maybe maybe there's another arm. There he goes. There it goes, right on off the canvas. Your tree, so you give him
as many arms as you want. Okay, see? See, touch.
Pull it that way out so you'll be able to see it over here now. Touch. There we go. Okay now, so let's put
some arms here and there, some limbs. See, I call them arms because trees are my friends. I'm crazy, I'll go out
and talk to 'em sometime. You got to make friends with
what you're gonna paint, you have to understand it. Look at it. Spend some time with it. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Okay maybe, tell you what, tell you what, there's a, I'll bet you, there it is.
I knew there was one there. Lives right there. See, that's one of the
things when I was a young boy my mother spent a lot of time teaching me to appreciate nature and beautiful things
that God had given us. And I'll always owe her for that. So, that's why I like to paint the type of paintings
that she would enjoy. Do anything for my lady. Alright, now you can put as
many, many limbs out here as you want. Let 'em go there, and have fun. Just wherever, wherever, wherever. You can spend all your
time just making limbs. But it helps to give your
painting a lot of character. Makes it beautiful. That little roll of paint
on the knife, that's all that you use. That's what creates all these effects. Okay, now that gives you a good idea. Now you can take your liner brush and put all kind of
detail in there, but let's there it is. Take some permanent red, some brown, mix it together, and let's highlight this. Gonna still get that little roll of paint and let's go up here to the canvas and put a little highlight. And all we're doing here
is just touching the canvas let's the canvas take off what it wants, it'll give you back what's left. You don't even have to worry about it. Let the canvas do the work. All you have to do is drive. You drive. Just touch, chicka-chicka-choo, let it go. Like so. Let it go. Just ride on up. Wherever you think light would strike, add the tiniest little
bit of white to it there. So maybe there's a little more
light striking right there, brighten it up a little. Brighten it up a little bit. There we go. There we go. There, there. There. Alright. Okay. Now on the other side here, let's take a little bit of the blue and the smallest amount of white in it. Very little, like so. And let's go up here, and let's put a little
blue over on this side. It'll give the indication
of reflected light. And it's very, very pretty, very effective, and it helps
give that tree limb depth. Okay, let's go right in here. There we go a little bit. ♫ Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun ♫ Right on up the side. Right up the side. I really hope my arm's
not in the way, there. Little bit right over here. Okay. Now we'll take the liner brush and just in case you haven't
seen me do this before, we'll take a little bit of paint thinner, and go right into some Van Dyke brown, turn that brush, bring
it to a nice sharp point. And let's go up here and, I just wanna show you how to put a few little limbs, And then at home, you know, there's
thousands of limbs on there You can just spend all the time you want just apply a lot of little limbs. And let 'em cross over there sometime. Don't have 'em just coming out the side. It'll look like somebody
took a big razor blade and cut your tree in two and half of it fell on the floor. And we don't wanna get your floor dirty. There, just as many of these as you want. Wherever you want 'em. It's your tree. Now, right down here. Let's cover up his little
foots with some grass, and pick up some of that
dark color and pull it out so it makes it look like a shadow. There we go. Okay. And I think we're to the point, let's sign this. I hope you've enjoyed it. Take a little paint thinner, A little permanent red, and we go right in here. And as I said, I hope you've enjoyed this I showed you some new things. And we look forward to
seeing you next week. And until then, from all of us here, happy painting, God bless. (smooth jazz music)
