Oh hello I'm Bob Ross and I'd like to welcome you to the joy of painting this is a wet on wet painting technique in each week I'll take you step-by-step through a beautiful oil painting if you've been with us before I'm glad to see you again if this is your first time with us drag up your paints in your big brush come along and paint with us and let's go ahead and get started and talk a little bit about what we're going to do up here I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of liquid white and this makes the canvas wet makes it slick it allows us to blend color right here on the canvas and now I'm going to have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this project with me it'll come across in the same order that I have them on the palette starting with a titanium white and working around while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started then we'll start with a two inch brush today and go right into a small amount of alizarin crimson and just really tap the brush into the color just tap it this assures a nice even distribution of paint all the way through the bristles okay let's go up here let's go right in here and just make little little criss-cross strokes little X's and put in a little tiny bit of pink just like so using very little pressure just apply it right on the canvas don't want that to get too bright we don't want to set this guy on fire we just want a little pinkish glow in this guy okay now then I'll take the same old dirty brush add a little more the crimson and a tiny tiny bit of phthalo blue proportionately we want much much more crimson than blue I'm just mixing this right on the brush to make a nice lavender color that's purplish color okay let's go up here and sort of test it now sort of test it up here if it's not the color you want stop and change it you can fix it this is your world and you can create any type of illusion that you want here you're the boss on this canvas you can do anything anything okay a little more paint I just sort of let that play around when a little more blue to that tiny bit more blue there today I thought we're doing nice painting it's very soft and very quiet you know it'll make you happy it's a very easy little painting there we go that's down here I'll just clean the brush off just like so okay then let's clean our brush we clean our brushes with odorless thinner and be sure it's odorless earth you'll be working by yourself shake off the excess right down here I have a box I shake the brush into then this is where you take out all your frustrations maybe the absolute most fun of this whole technique okay now let's take the clean brush and go right back up here and just blend the sky together still using little crisscross strokes still using them back and forth back and forth there we go okay and you can blend this to any degree of softness that you want you can blend it till you lose all the little variations that you have personally I like to leave some of those in there but when you're doing your painting you look at it and you do it the way that you want it okay there we go and that quickly we have a very effective little sky and we'll just use long strokes here to take out any brush marks okay and that gives us a happy little sky now then let's take a little bit of the phthalo blue and the alizarin crimson we'll just mix it together still we have a little bit more of the crimson when we do blue we're still working with a nice lavender color pull it out very flat and then cut across it so it's a small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife there you go okay let's go right up here maybe there's a happy little mountain that lives right along here you're really pushing this paint right into the fabric really get firm with it you're not gonna hurt this canvas shoot they make tents out of this tough really push it in use a lot of pressure a lot pressure holy the only thing you worried about is this nice outside shape here you could care less what's happening down here and it gives us a basic little little mountain shape now then let's go back to our large brush and grab that and pull it just pull it now that's mixing with a liquid white and automatically it gets lighter toward the base and if you can see the entire mountain it should be lighter at the bottom than it is at the top and as we've said on previous shows because at the bottom you have mist and now we have pollution and these things have a tendency to break up and diffuse light so it looks softer at the bottom now by just taking the knife here we can create the illusion of highlights and shadows just push very firmly you can take the least little touch of titanium white we want these mountains to be far far away so they don't have much detail just very barely touch smallest amount of the titanium white and I'm rubbing it Jane let's put a little tiny bit right there then we can just rub that right him simi creates the illusion of all kind of things happening without you actually doing a whole bunch it keeps that mountain looking like it's far far away far away far away there we go maybe a little touch right in there wherever you just make a decision in your mountain and put it wherever you want it and then we can tap that you blend it a little bit and that mountain should look just like it's just laying there and just floating in the sky very soft very quiet okay let's have some fun now maybe there's a little footy Hill that lives right down here so we'll just keep using this old two inch brush I'm going to take a little blue a little bit of crimson and I'll just mix them right on the brush we'll add a tiny little bit of white in there too so we've got Lisbon crimson little bit of phthalo blue touch it white okay and I'm just tapping the brush just happen it lets go right back up here maybe there's a little foothill that lives right here and all you needs just the corner of the brush and just begin laying in some basic shapes yeah I sort of let your brush touch and pull downward touch pull down straight down straight down and maybe they come right on down here wherever you want a little more pain there we go there they are just right on down and then I want to create the illusion of mist right under the bottom of this foothill so I'll take a clean two inch brush and we'll come right here and tap firmly if you can hear that tapping very firmly and that'll create the illusion of mist at the base of these foothills just like so and then very lightly lift upward just lift straight up straight up and flick it out okay maybe tell you what maybe there's another layer of foothills in there so let's go right into the same color lizard crimson phthalo blue but I wanted a little bit darker this thing is get closer to you to landscape they should get a little darker and value okay let's go right back here let's start right here and maybe we'll just bring this one down and let it drop there it is there it is just right on down right on down see it's a little bit darker so it stands out might even had the smallest smallest touch of SAP green to that the smallest touch I just want to begin giving the indication of a little green far far back here okay then we'll take our clean dry brush and once again I want to create that illusion to mist down here at the bottom so we tap it very firmly very firmly and you're using just this area you can see see just the top corner of the brush strike the canvas like so that's like it that easy you have missed the bottom left foot hill and then lift up right there and got something okay we'll wash the old brush here I like to wash the brush that's the most fun part course everybody's studio is covered okay now then let's begin putting some little things that are happening we we back in the distance I'm going back into this lavender color I made and add a tiny tiny bit of SAP green just the smallest amount and all I'm doing is tapping the still tapping okay let's go right up here that may be back in here we back in here it's just a little soft he'll lives we back here very gentle there and we're going to put layer after layer after layer of little Hills back here now if you live in the Carolinas or someplace that have the beautiful beautiful Hills this is a super way to make them you can make all those beautiful mountains that you have in that area the same way just leave this big one out there we go a little bit more color on the brush maybe I take what maybe there's one it comes from this direction want to add a little touch more blue in there there later that's better now we wanted to get a little darker as they get closer so all we're doing is just tapping very gently okay okay little more the green into that color and you have to make all mighty decisions here maybe this one comes right down there it is look at that see now each time you do this you're creating planes in here and each plane that you add into your painting makes your painting look deeper it shows much more depth in it and of course we're not interested in that almighty dollar but if you should be that's what sells the painting there we go there we go see just layer after layer after layer I tell you what let's have some fun let's have some fun let me grab a fan brush here and we'll mix up same old color a little blue Ezreal crimson and then went ahead a little bit of white to that little bit of white there we go a little bit more than crimson good okay a white with a knife off now we're gonna load this fan brush full of paint just really load it full wig lead in there okay let's go right up here maybe back here lives a happy little tree a little evergreen tree now just sort of touch it to give you a Center and then give it a little upward push sometimes we make evergreens by pushing down sometime by pushing up or today I thought we'd do it upward look at all the little things happen there look at that look at that cute little tree and we don't want him to get lonely so let's give him a happy little friend his little friend lives right there trees need friends too they all all need a friend there yes okay and you know what happens if there's two trees sooner or later I have little saddle the guns are gonna get together here's a little tree he lives right here beside him just like so okay and you're painting you put as many trees as you want I'm gonna put three right there maybe I tell you what let's have a little tree a little tiny tree there's right there and we make him the same way only smaller just make him in the smaller and go out and study trees make friends with trees you know I talked about going out in the woods and mm-hmm and sitting around the dog eating trees there's nothing wrong with that that's the way you learned what makes a tree look like a tree spend some time with nature let it become your good friend I'll put some more trees or a doubt in there see there you'll just put trees wherever you want them tell you what let's do let's take this brush and see right here at the base I'm gonna take his brush and just begin picking up some of that color and tapping all I'm doing is tapping I'm going to begin adding a little color to that little yellow ocher little CAD yellow just very lightly and being again creating little highlights on all these little Hills so that I'm all blend together just a nice soft little meadow back here add a little Indian yellow here in there a little touch of bright red tiniest little amount of the red toe there we go just just a highlight a little don't get carried away all right okay and I'm just sort of mixing all of these yellows and Red's together on the brush there we are there see how that begins to soften and increase the illusion of depth that's what we're looking for all right I'll tell you what let's go back into this same old color the blue and the crimson and the white get the old brush all loaded up here a lot of paint tiles go back up here maybe in here some more little trees just give it a little push upward and once again in your painting you put as many or as few trees as you want but the more you make the more practice you get and if there's a secret to painting it's practice it's practice the more you paint the easier it becomes it's like anything else when you first first started tying your shoe probably probably didn't work first time you had to practice it a few times and now you can do it without even looking it was the same way with painting pretty soon you can do it and it's almost oh it just happens you don't have to worry about how to load this brush you can spend your thinking time worrying about composition and and begin looking at things in the painting that's when it's fine that's when you truly experience the joy of painting maybe tell you what maybe right here this old tree he didn't make it in nature you have trees that oh maybe maybe somebody stepped on him when he's little and they got a little uh little herd in them and they died but you had dead trees in nature too so put some of those in your painting it makes them look real okay we'll just drop it not a little tree of two okay then once again we just grab the bottom of that and let it go tap it then we can take our liner brush you know use a little bit of the liquid black on it just put a little indication here and there have a fuel fuel looms that are still hanging off these dead trees back here and that easy we got her okay yeah then takes more blue and some more crimson there we go all right let's let's come right down here and here comes another hill and all we're doing is initially laying in the base color a dark color just like so don't cover it completely leave some of these areas that are light in here these will create all kinds of beautiful effects when you're finished and as you know if you've painted with us before we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents so learn to work with these things anything that happens learn to use it learn to use it let it be your friend sometimes you have a tendency to fight painting and just just work with whatever happens whatever happens here we go seeing you begin again creating the curvature of the land here or the lay of the land just sort of let your mind wander and enjoy painting should make you happy should really make you happy there you know the one thing if painting teaches you nothing else it teaches you to look at nature I get letters every day for fantastic people that say Baba I've looked at the tree in my front yard ever since it was a little baby and I've never really seen until I started painting and that's true that's so true painting it teaches you to see to appreciate pretty soon here you're heading down the street and you say oh my gosh look at that tree a trees made of sap green with a little blue in it or that cloud can be done with a fan brush of course you had to be careful you're wrecked a car when you're doing things like yeah but okay I'm going to add the least little touch of white and a little bit of red right on the brush just tapping it in just tapping okay maybe there's a little light that plays right through here what is to be a little bright area right in there so I'm gonna do is just sort of tap that on it maybe like right there right there all right there I'm just taking go right into a little bit of yellow and a little green to that and I'm using all the yellows here little touch of the red touch of the reasons very strong okay let's go back up here now then we can begin just tapping on some highlights here see and begin once again begin thinking about the lay of the land just sort of let it flow because on this piece of canvas you can create anything anything there we go see now if you want to create little Hills it should be brighter on top than it is down here and that gives you illusion of a little Hill like a light striking apparently to get darker darker darker darker as it works down there you go hmm you know I've painted thousands and thousands of paintings and I still get excited when I see at work it's so fantastic and I don't look at all the little hills and little ridges and you can do it you can do it see a little bright areas just it just shows up little Sun striking right through there pretty when it's done in touch right there okay less really has some fun yeah I'm gonna go right into the the midnight black and I'm gonna add a little bit of Van Dyke Brown just mix it right on the brush a lot of paint a lot of paint okay let's go up here maybe there's some some big trees that live in here and I think one lives right there and all I'm gonna do is just tap just tap to come right down like so just tap it in and I have several fan brushes going here so I don't have to wash them take a little bit of the white right on this brush and watch here we're gonna come right down this edge right down the edge and we'll put some highlight right on that tree and that easy that easy you have a nice strong tree trunk oh that was fun let's do another let's do another insane color little brown black now you had to make a decision where is the trees live in your painting I know right there dairy cows and all these trees aren't perfectly straight like telephone poles let them let them have a little character trees are like people each one has has its own individual personality Oh field or to be one right there right across the mountain every tree is different once again spend some time with nature go out and go out and talk to a tree don't matter people thank you crazy us painters you know they think we're a little weird anyway that's all right that's all right tell you what maybe okay right here we'll have a smaller tree that lives right here on this little hill we'll push him back I can't can't go over the other side here we don't want this side to have all the trees so we'll put there's one right there OOP just drop it off this is just black with brown huh big one right there big ole tree a little more of the brown bagel tree he comes right down my cabin hey there okay easy they were to make and we'll take our other fan breast it has the white on it and very quickly you can just go right along here and dis drop on a little bit of highlight remember which side the lights coming from and if you're right-handed it's normally easier to have the light coming from the right left-handed it'll vary from person to person okay let's go right along here mmm let's drop on some little things like so 10 specs though hmm can't let's take a liner brush and I'm gonna put a little bit of the liquid black out here on my palate take our liner brush and I'm add a little tiny bit of thinner to it so it's a very thin turn that brush bring it to a nice point let's go right here now then here and there just drop on a few happy little limbs little arms on the trees yeah trees got some arms see just wherever you think they should live you know pine trees always have old broken ones all over look at that look at that this is just liquid black with a little bit of thinner here and you can put as many or as few as you want if you back in here we don't want this old tree to be left out there here we go okay let's go over here put a little bit ah right there right there but this is a very nice painting if it's your first painting project it's works very well if you've painted with me before it's a paint you'll give you a lot of fun but there gives us a few indications of some limbs yeah then let's take let's take the old fan brush I'm gonna use some of the black still and we'll drop a few little leaves on these trees okay let's go right up here now we touch and give it a little upward push make little smiley faces yeah sort of make a decision where you think they live off of me drop em in maybe look here a few on this old tree plus like that let's put a few in this little tree leave some of the old trunk showing some on this one hmm all kinds of things happening and just let them go yes let them go I'll give this trees out there si all kinds of leaves here and that's some of the sky show through and I'm over right into a little bit of the SAP green with a touch of yellow on it and come back and very gently I like some of these and that easy you have a beautiful tree and I think with that we just about have a finished painting so I think we'll call that one done and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and we'll see you next time Oh you
