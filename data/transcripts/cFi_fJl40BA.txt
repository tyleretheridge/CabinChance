(easygoing instrumental music) - Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. It's a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you're at. So, I tell ya what, let's start out and have 'em run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what
I've got up here today. I thought today we'd do
one of our little ovals. This is just contact paper
with an oval cut out of it and stuck on a canvas. Then I've covered the inside with a thin even coat of liquid white, so it's all slick and wet and ready to go. So that's exactly what we'll do. We'll just take of here
with the ol' two-inch brush and let's start today with a
small amount of phthalo blue. Little phthalo blue, maybe I'll get a little black right there, little phthalo blue and black and the least little
touch of phthalo green. Least little touch, I just wanna, just wanna sparkle the color up a little. So, I say, it's a fantastic day here, so I thought we'd do a little painting that would just make ya happy, just will make ya happy. We'll put a little bit
of blue in here like this and that little touch of green in there will just make it sparkle. There, I'm gonna leave a little
place open here in the center, just a little one open. I'll show you why here in just a second. Something like so. Okay, while I have that color going, maybe we'll have a little water in there. You know me, I love water. So, we use the same colors phthalo blue, little midnight black, and a touch of phthalo green. You can have a little more
in the water if you want to than in the sky. Be careful with it in the sky though. And we'll just pull across and put the indication of
a little water down here. And we're not too worried
about it right now, because anything that we
don't want to be water, shoot, we'll just plant a tree on it, or whatever happens to be there. There, okay, now then let me wash the ol' brush. That's the fun part of
this whole technique, it's just washing the brush. And it's a good way to
get even with anybody that's be hassling you
in the last few days. There, (chuckles) see what I mean? There we go. I may take just a little touch, little tiny touch of the Indian yellow. I don't want much, just a little tiny bit, little cad yellow too. I'm gonna mix 'em together, so I get sort of a semitransparent yellow, semitran, that's almost transparent, but not much color. And I'm gonna add the least
little touch right up in here like it's a little sunlight
playing through there, just a little. Now be very careful when you do this, because too much of this against that blue will turn bright green. Put a little down here in
the water too, what the heck. Just let it sorta go right across there. Now then, one more time
clean the ol' brush. Actually, I just like to clean the brush. (chuckles) Good and dry and then very gently just
go and blend this together. But there's very little paint
on the canvas, very little. Just want a little tiny glow there, I don't want a lot of
color, just a little. And down here, same thing. All right, there. I just beat the brush to
knock off any excess paint. That way we don't have to clean the, in layman terms, that's known as laziness, just plain laziness. Let's take a little bit
of our midnight black with a little tiny amount
of the Prussian blue in it, maybe, be right back,
a little bit of that, a little alizarin crimson in there, too. So we got black, a little
blue, little crimson on the fan brush, both sides loaded. And maybe in our world, maybe there's some big ol' clouds that live up in here in the sky and just sort of float
around, have a good time. So let's just take the fan brush and just sort of wind 'em up,
just make little tiny circles, little tiny circles. Maybe there's a little
doer that comes out there, I don't know, just sorta let it go. Clouds are so free that you can just about paint any way that you want. If you're like me, when we were kids we used to go out and see all kinda shapes in the clouds. We'd make up little things. We'd see Puff, the magic dragon or the wicked old witch, or whatever, whatever, just anything
that you wanted to see if you looked long enough in clouds, you could find 'em. So they're very free. Shoot, maybe, maybe
there's a little floater right there and maybe there's a bigger one that comes right across here. It doesn't matter. This is your world and
you can do anything here that your heart desires. You have total freedom here, totally in control. This may be the only world
that I'm in control of and the same with you. But here, you can literally do anything. Little stringy cloud right back here. There. A good dry two-inch brush, should be very dry though, 'cause otherwise we'll sorta
mix these up more than we want. All we wanna do here is just sorta, actually all we're doing
is removing excess paint, so we can blend it. That's all we're really doing, just barely grazing it, caressing it, touching it gently, very gently, just with the corner of
the brush most of the time, just sorta, just sorta winding
it up here, fluffing it. And as I say, in reality the
biggest thing we're doing is removing excess
paint so we can do this. There we go and we just, just blend that to any degree
of softness that you want. Something maybe about like that. Okay, we just beat the brush
a little to knock off the excess paint. Now then, maybe I'll take a fan brush, little fan brush, we'll
put a little white on it. Be right back, get a little
tiny amount of the bright red. Don't want much, just a little tiny amount and maybe here and there just sorta tip the edges of that a little bit. I don't want this to get too bright, just want a little
indication here and there of a little floater that lives up in here, tiniest, tiniest little bit. There, maybe a little in here. Wherever, you make the decision. And then very gently go right over that and that just helps create that illusion of little things that are happening, but I don't want 'em too bright. All right, isn't that
a fantastic way though of making a very effective little sky? And it's pretty, too. Now then, now then, let me grab, let me grab, we'll use one of the little, the little small round brushes, about a half size round. We're gonna take some black, little bit of the Prussian blue, reach up here and get a little van dyke, little alizarin crimson, maybe a little touch of
the sap green in there. But just tap the brush, just tap it. And maybe in our world, maybe back in here in the background maybe
there's some little trees that live back in here. And this little brush is just fantastic for making these little trees. Little things that live right
along in there, wherever. You have to make the
decision where they live, how many there are, big, small, skinny,
fat, whatever you want. You have to make those decisions. There we go. Something like that. That gives it some very
basic little shapes. All right, now then, let's find an
ol' scrip liner brush. Little bit of the van dyke
brown, little paint thinner, and let's go right up in here and here and there make the
indication of a little trunk in some of these little trees. Not too many, but just
a little here and there. Maybe there's even one or two
that stick out above up there that you can see. I like that. Now then, we'll just use that same
ol' brush, what the heck. What the heck. If we go into a little
bit of the cad yellow, it should turn a nice greenish color. We'll use a little yellow ochre, little Indian yellow here and there and my once in a while a
little bit of the bright red. 'Kay, let's go back up here. Now then, let's put some nice highlights on these little trees, there. We'll vary the colors going
between the different yellows, just to change the flavor now and then. Doesn't that little
brush do some beautiful little things there? Gonna really highlight that, well, I want him to
stand out better, there. Boy, he's a shiner. Add a little touch of
the bright red to it. There, see? Just put a little doer in there. There we go. And maybe we'll give him a
little friend right down here, but do little layers like this and it'll create that illusion of depth that we're always talking about. Let's go over here. Do this one over, over here, don't want him left out. There, but don't kill all your dark areas. Sometimes this gets working nice and you get carried away and
you kill all the dark areas and then you lose your
shadows, lose your shadows. Get a little more of that
sap green and put in there. There, now if you really
want a bright green like springtime, and a little
bit of the phthalo green. That'll really sparkle. There, maybe just tap that one, dull it down a little bit. Don't want it to stand out too much. It'll be the only thing
we see in the painting. There we are. But see, if you get one that
you think's a little bright, if you just tap it, it
picks up the base color and you're in business again. 'Cause we don't make mistakes. We have happy accidents. Let's use those same colors, those black, little Prussian blue, little van dyke brown,
little sap green, crimson. And maybe in our world a little land lives right here, little land right there, there it is. All right, and I'm just
tapping in some dark color. And we'll put some grass on top of that, but we need that dark color
so our light will show. There. Tell you what, tell you what, let's have some fun today. Let's have some fun. This will be a nice place, maybe, maybe there's a big bank here. We haven't done that in quite a while. Maybe there's a big bank sets right here. We'll take a little bit of van dyke brown and I'm just sorta pulling it over. Bloop, like that. There, just wherever, maybe a little more down here on this end. Okay, now, take a little bit of white, little dark sienna, little van dyke brown, mix 'em together, but
leave 'em very marbled. And barely grazing the canvas, following those angles, just come right along like that and just let it just
barely, barely touch it, barely touch it. Just graze it. Just graze it, I mean, just the lightest possible touch, lightest touch. We'll just use that same ol' brush. Doesn't matter if it's
got a little color on it. It'll just make green
when we touch the yellows. There, just push so you get
that little ridge of paint right out on the end of the bristles. And we can take that and we can go in here and begin applying a little highlight. Paying very close attention
to the lay of the land, or the way the land flows,
whatever you wanna call it. Let some of that just
go right over the edge. And touch a little of the
bright red here and there. Put a little sparkler, see? But let it just crawl right over the edge. Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, like that. There, just a little more color. But isn't that neat, how you can just make it look like there's little grassy areas
hanging right over the bank on the side of a, maybe this is a little river. Let's make a little river out of this. Little river just sort
of meanders along here. There, sort of a nice word. It feels good on your tongue, meander. Guess that's a word. I like it anyway. There, there's another little
hangy down right there. But isn't that neat the way it just, it already looks like a
little bank up in here? Shoot, you know me, I'd have
to have a little house here. Let's put a little cabin right here. I'm just gonna take the knife and let's just scrap out a basic shape. Don't want a big cabin, just want a little guy that lives here. 'Cause I would like to live right there. I'd have a good time. I'd sit right here in the living room and throw my fishing line
right out in the water. And if I caught one, we'd put a band-aid on him, wish him well, give him a little CPR, put him back on the water, pat him on the too-too
and send him on his way and we'd catch him again some other day. This is just van dyke brown. I'm just blocking in a basic shape. Let me get the little knife. This is a small cabin, little knife makes it a
little easier to get in there. There, that's the reason we
designed the little knife, do little things, so we
might as well use it. There we go. Now, I'm gonna take some white, put the least little
touch of bright red in it and dark sienna. Make a nice warm color, cut across, get a little roll of paint. On this side over here just touch, pull down, something like that. Now on the other side, I wanna add a little van dyke
brown to that same color, because in my mind I
think this side over here, well that didn't get
any darker, do it again. Should be a little darker over here. There, that's better. Little rascal didn't wanna play right. There we go. All right, I wanna darken that even a little more right up against the top. There, now we can take just a little bit of straight van dyke brown on the knife, touch it, make the indication
of some old boards. This is an old cabin out here, old fishing cabin. Take our knife, do our old cabinectomy, soon as we decide what shape we want it. We need a door. There, we better put
the door on this side, 'cause if we put it on the other side when you walk out you're
gonna fall right in the creek. Probably ruin your whole day. Now let's take a little white, a little of the midnight black, and we'll make a nice gray color. And with the small edge of the knife, let's go up in here, let's put the indication
of some little shingles on this house. Just some little tiny shingles, doop-doop. Gotta make those little noises. And maybe some of these shingles have already blowed off, so don't worry if they
don't all look perfect. It's an old cabin out here. It's seen its better day. Old cabin like me, tired, there, little highlight just so it shows up a little better. Now then, back to my brush that we were making the grassy areas with and let's put some things
around his little bottom here. Doop, doop, doop, some
little grassy things, maybe the grass has grown
clean up to the door, clean up to the door there. There, all right, okay, now let's take, let's take our knife we'll put a little bit of a
little liquid white out here and we'll put the least
little touch of black into it, so I make a very light gray color, cut across, get our little bit of paint right on the edge of the knife and let's come right up in here and we'll clean up the
bottom of this cliff, bank, whatever we wanna call it, rocky area that drips over
here into the water, whatever. But just rub it, just rub it firmly. And I don't want it to
be perfectly straight. I want all kind of little indentations and little doodads in there, because that's where the fish hide. I like to catch fish, but as I say, I'm not
a very good fisherman. I just, I sorta turn 'em loose. There, but that's okay. All right, now, let me find another one of those little round
brushes, I like them. Let's take our black and blue and brown and crimson and sap green, just load a lot of those colors on there. Maybe in our world, right over in here, we gotta have something on this side. Maybe there lives a little
peninsula right here. That way we can push that stream back. We can just push it around. There we go, this is a
nice little tree here. This would be a fantastic place for my little squirrel to live. I'v showed him several times. I'd like to show him one
more time in this series, 'cause I"m so crazy about
these little rascals. There he is in my backyard. You see, after I turned him loose, how dependent he still is. I think he's got sorta used to the old man feeding him here. They really didn't go far
when I turned 'em loose. They certainly knew
where they had it made. There, now, let's have a little
reflection on there. Grab it and pull down, straight down, and go gently, gently across. Aren't those little squirrels cute? I raised, oh, about a half
a dozen of them this year and most of 'em we've turned loose now and they're living out in my backyard, just having a good time. I still feed 'em everyday,
so they hang around. They hang around. And people come over to see me and they go out in the backyard and if they're not expecting it, it sorta scares you when this squirrel jumps on your shoulder out of the tree, but that's all right. People get used to it and
they certainly like 'em once they know they're not gonna attack. They like 'em, you can't hardly help but like one of them little rascals. Let's take some of our greens and yellows and all of those colors. I'm gonna reach over here and get the least little touch of
liquid white and put in there. I want that to be a little bit thinner and a little bit brighter, so I use liquid white
rather than paint thinner, so it stands out from the
stuff in the background there. Now we can come right
up here with this brush and that quick we can just throw all kinds of little grassy things up
here, little leafy things. There, see? Isn't that neat how that little brush just drops all those in? That easy. I really like this little,
little round brush. There. Now then, little bright
red, little yellow ochre, we'll just play, shoot. Let's have some nice, nice little bush out here
that really sparkles. Oooh, that's a nice one, nice one, nice one, that one will
get your attention. Little one right here, wherever, just sort of look at 'em and decide where you
think they should live and drop 'em in. There we go, that easy. Now we can take, take a little touch of
the liquid white on here and then just very easy, just put a little indication like that in. Maybe a little bit of van
dyke brown there, too, just to make it look
like there's a little, a little dirt there. There, and then let it just go right into that liquid white. And that's the simplest,
easiest way there is of making the indication of a little bank without really doing nothing. Now we just take and scratch in a few little sticks and twigs and all those little
things that live out there. Tell you what, why don't we bring the
camera right up here, I'm gonna pull the contact paper off and then we'll play some. This is the moment of truth right here. Shoot, that looks pretty nice right there just the way it is, maybe we'll just quit. Nah, you know me, I've gotta have a big tree
over here on the other side. I get letters sometimes, people say, "You did the most beautiful painting on TV "the other day and then you
put that dumb tree in there." (chuckles) I get carried away with trees, but when you do 'em at home, if you don't want a tree in there please don't put one in. The only thing I'm doing
is showing you ideas. And by showing you ideas, I hope I spark your imagination and you come up with many, many more ideas than I've ever had. And that's when painting
really becomes fun. It's when it's your own creation. It's not just something you're copying that somebody else did. But really, we're not trying
to teach you how to copy, we're trying to teach
you a method of painting, a style of painting, a technique, and then turn you loose on the world. 'Cause once you have this,
you can paint anything. Anything, you just need a
little vision in your mind. Practice visualizing
paintings in your mind. There we go, something, gonna
have tree right over here. Shoot, maybe, maybe it
comes right on down here. I don't know, wherever you want. There's a little bush and we let it wander right
on out to about there. Something like so. You decide when you do yours. Now then, there we go. Let's grab an ol' fan brush here, fill it full of van dyke brown, little dark sienna, and we just mix 'em together on the brush and let's put a old
tree trunk up in there. This is an old gnarly tree. It's got a lot of wiggles and jiggles and all kinds of little things in it. There's another arm on it. That'd make a big slingshot, nice tree. There's his little foots. Okay, take a little white, little dark sienna, mix 'em together, get our little roll of paint and let's just put the
indication here and there of a little highlight on this tree, there. Just let that, just sort of
float right down the tree allowing it to break,
barely, barely touching, just barely touching. And that ol' rascal will just jump right out there at ya. Something like that. Take a little touch of the Prussian blue, little white, put it
on the other side here, just to give the indication
of a little reflected light. Go right back into that dark color and over the top of it gently, and I'm not kidding when this is dry, it'll look and feel like real bark. You'll absolutely be amazed
at how real it looks. I'm gonna put a bunch of leaves on there, so we don't need many limbs. We'll put a couple. Don't want too many. Maybe there's one that
comes all the way out there. We don't care. There, now then, back to
our little round brush, get a little bit of the color. I'm gonna have some
more sap green in there. Ooh, that's nice. Let's go up in here and let's just put in a few leaves on this tree. Just a few leaves that sparkle and play and have a good time. There they go. Let some of 'em go on
out here past the dark. It makes sort of an
interesting effect, like, there we are, wherever, wherever. Now then, let me add a little
touch of the bright red and let's just come down here and balance in a few little bushes and, shoot, we'll have
a finished painting. Hope you've enjoyed this one, 'cause I certainly like
these little paintings. These ovals, as I say, may be one of the neatest things that we've ever come up with. As I travel around the country, now I see 'em all over. There, let that just wander right on back. 'Kay, maybe a few little
things back in here behind the tree. Leave some of these dark areas. They'll make nice things in there. Okay, take the knife, scrap in a stick and a twig. Shoot, you got a finished painting. Think we'll call that one done. Hope you've enjoyed it and from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. (easygoing instrumental music)
