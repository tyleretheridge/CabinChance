- Oh, hey, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. You ready to do a
fantastic little painting? Tell you what, before we start, I'd like to take just a second and introduce you to a
couple of my little friends that I have here. These are little, tiny swifts. They're just the teeniest little babies. Can you see 'em there? Look at that. Aren't they the cutest little rascals? They're probably, maybe about a week old. Just little tiny guys. I absolutely adore
these little characters. They're so cute. Look at there, hah. Look like Mutt and Jeff. They're just beginning
to get their feathers in. And probably now, in
about five or six weeks, we'll turn 'em loose. I'll tell ya what, let's run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that I'm
gonna reach right over here and put them back in their little nest, and off we'll go. There, you guys go sleep,
and I'll go to work. Okay, there. Okay. Today I have my standard old canvas, and all I've done is just covered it with a little bit of liquid white. So it's all, it's all
slick, and ready to go. (brush thudding) And we can take off and have a good time. Let's start today with a little
bit of the indian yellow. Just a small amount. Right on the old two-inch brush. And we'll go right up in here. I'm just gonna take a little
of that indian yellow, and just put in a quick little, little yellow right here. Not much, just a little. All right. Something about like that. Don't need a lot of color. Just wanna put a little
yellow glow in there. Aren't those little birds some
of the cutest little rascals you've ever seen? Those were orphaned and
they're being taken care of by Diana Shaffer, who
lives here in Muncie, one of the bird ladies. (brush thudding) All right, now I'm gonna
go right into phthalo blue. Just a little bit of that on the brush. I washed the brush in between these colors because as you know,
yellow and blue make green, and I don't wanna end up
with a bright green sky. Just wanna bring this blue
down to where it touches. Very carefully, very carefully, about like so. And then we'll gently,
gently blend it together. All right. Very lightly. Don't want it to turn bright green. Something, mmm, about like so. But when you're doing this, when you're using blue
and yellow together, once again, be very
cautious, very cautious. Unless you're looking for a green sky. 'Cause it'll happen, it'll
happen in one heart beat. Maybe a little cloud lives there. What the heck, we don't care. And then all you do is
just pull it a little bit. Just make a little stringy
cloud to break it up. Okay, while we have that going, let's take a little bit
more of the phthalo blue, I'm gonna a little prussian
blue to it, to make it darker. Whew, good dark colors. Let's go back here. Maybe we'll have some water in here today. Pull from the outside, in. 'Cause I wanna leave that
area open, right in here. So pull from the outside, in. 'Bout like that. And a little more paint and
we'll go from the other side. See that area we're leaving open? If it works out, it'll
make like a sheen of light coming across the water. Could be your best friend. People will go crazy trying to figure out how in the world you did that. And it was so easy. Don't start here and go
over, it'll leave a big line. It's very hard to blend out. Now we get to wash the old brush again. (brush thudding) (laughs) There we go. That really is the most fun part. Now with clean brush, we can
just blend this a little bit, to soften everything, and
just blend it together. That's all we're doing. That's really all. There, now we'll go
over the entire canvas. It'll pull a little color across the, but that light area is
still there, still there. Still there, okay. (brush pounding) All right, let's have some fun. Today, I'll tell ya what, let's take some white, a little phthalo blue, some alizarin crimson, we'll
just mix 'em together here. I wanna make a lavender color. Sorta, sorta to the reddish side. Make a little roll of paint. And we'll go right up in here. And today let's just have some fun. Let's do all kinds of
things that live in here. There they go. Just wherever, where ever. There, maybe, whoop, there's another one. Hope you enjoy seeing the little birds and other animals that
we show on this series. As I say, they are very,
very special to me. And I spend I great
deal of my time messing with these little critters
and trying to help 'em out. So, I like to share 'em with you. People I've met through the painting show have become very dear friends. And when you have close friends, things that you like, you like to share. So, bear with me. All right. That'll give us some nice little shapes that are quite different. Now, all we're gonna do
is grab this and pull it. Take an old two-inch brush and pull it. See, it's mixing with that
color that's underneath. Something like so, and
automatically it'll begin looking like highlights and
shadows in your mountain. And you don't have to do hardly a thing. Let the brush work the canvas, the paint. You don't have to work yourself to death. There, see. Just let it go wherever. Wherever, we don't even care over here. Just let it blend right out into nothing. 'Bout like that. Then that gives us a nice
little distant mountain. Look how misty it is at the base. Happens automatically if
you have a little color under there and you just
let it blend together. Take that same color and we'll add a little bit
more of the phthalo blue. I just do it on the brush. Add a little more of the phthalo blue, to that same identical color. And let's go up in here. Yep, and I'm gonna touch and pull down. Just touch and pull down. We'll just make another
little footy hill that lives, I don't know, wherever you want it to be. It's a good start, right there. There, something like that. And if you don't like the shape, which I don't there. Change it. In your world you can change
anything that you want. Anything that you want. All right, I'm gonna grab
a clean two-inch brush. I wanna create more mist at the base. So all you'd have to do, is just tap it, firmly. Tap firmly. And once again lift upward. Now see it has yellow in the sky, there's yellow mist in between these two. And you can just keep, okay,
we'll do it, we'll do it. We'll do, I get carried away. I'm gonna go into black, prussian blue, and a little crimson. I want this to be much darker. All right, these are, these
would be closer to us, in my mind. So, we're gonna make 'em darker. And we just tap. There, wherever. There it goes back up, too. Wherever. There. And I'm just pulling sort of downward. Just to fuzz out the edges some. But already we have three different plains in that painting. Once again, we'll take a little bit of, this is just a clean brush,
just a little bit of pressure. And we're tapping it to create mist, right down here at the base. There. All right. Shoot, that's all there is to it. Now, take a little bit of the, oh, we got black and prussian blue. Yeah, what the heck. Let's put a dark color in here. And make another plain. There. And we just, this is really
just applying some dark color. We don't care. You could put this on with a paint roller. Doesn't matter. But I suggest you put it on the same way, you're gonna paint on top of it. Because that way it gives
you a little practice. It gives you, it gives you some
practice feeling the brush. So much of this is a feel that comes with practice. It's like anything else. The more you practice
the easier it becomes. What's hard today will be simple tomorrow. And the next day it will just be a habit. You won't even have to think about it. And that just comes with practice. Doing it over and over and over. Repetition, repetition. All artists, I don't care how they paint, or what they paint, have practiced if they're
good at what they do. It's not just artists,
people in any walk of life, those who are good at it, you better believe they have
devoted the time to practice. Okay, let's have water here, reflection. Doop, doop. Just drop it in. Something straight down, though. It's most important. I want this to be pretty dark. Pretty dark. I'm using black, prussian blue. Pretty dark though. That brush is dirty, so I'll just take one that's
pretty clean, fairly clean, pull straight down, and then go across. That'll end up being nice
reflections when we're all done. Okay, we'll just use this same brush. It's got blue and all
those colors on it, black. When you mix those, let's get some sap green. When you mix 'em with
yellow they turn green. We'll add sap green, so it gives us a nice
collection of greens here. Okay, and let's go back up here. Now then, oh yeah, nice. Nice little grassy area
that lives back in here. See there. But you need that dark underneath or it just absolutely will not show up. Will not show up. Need all that dark underneath. The dark is there only so the light shows. Only so the light shows. There. And the least little
touch of liquid white. I want to brighten it just a little more. Put liquid white in if
you wanna brighten it, paint thinner if you just wanna thin it without changing the color. There. There, I like that. There we are. I'll tell what, let's do, see you get crazy when you do this. Let's take a little black a little white, mix it together, make a nice gray color. Add to that a little dark sienna. But I don't wanna over mix it. Leave it marbled. Cut off a little roll of paint, and maybe up in here, barely grazing the canvas. Maybe we can see a little bit of, a little indication of
some dirt here and there. Anything we don't like we'll
just put grass back over it. 'Cause it's our world. And in our world we have absolute power. We can do anything here, anything. If you could imagine it in your mind, you can do it here. It might take a little practice, like anything else as we discussed, but you can do it. Okay. I'm gonna add a little paint thinner. Just to thin that down a little bit. And let's put in, yeah, see. All kinds of little grassy areas. Add a little bright red here and there. Whew, I like that color. I like that. Just changes the whole flavor. Just adding that little bit of red to it. There. All right. Maybe, I'll tell ya what,
maybe there's some fall colors beginning to happen in this painting. I like fall colors, 'cause
they're bright and cheery. They make you happy. Absolutely do. So, let's we're gonna get crazy. You knew that though, didn't you? Let's take midnight black, prussian blue, alizarin
crimson, some sap green, We'll just throw 'em all together, and whatever comes out, we like it. We like it. We'll use old two-inch brush, go right in there. Load a lot of color. A lot of paint into it. Gonna drag it full of
color, and then shake it. Like that. That'll sharpen it and bring it to a very
sharp chiseled edge. 'Kay, see there how sharp that is? Shoo, could shave with it. Looks like I need to. (laughs) Let's do this. Touch, use just the corner of the brush. And we'll make us a happy little tree, lives right there. Right there. See, you can make a tree
with a two-inch brush, one-inch brush, it doesn't matter. Make him a little stronger, there. Let's give him a little friend. That's what's so great
about working with children. I spend a lot of time
working with children. They don't think nothing
about making a tree with a two-inch brush. You tell 'em to do it, they say, "Okay." It's wonderful. They have no hang-ups. Those we learn later in life. Children don't have those yet. Tree made with a two-inch brush, okay. And they do it and it's beautiful. Children seem to have a
natural knack for painting. I think there's a creative being that lives in each and every one of us. And maybe in children, still free. There, maybe there's
another one right there. We'll separate 'em with highlights. We don't even care at this point. Let's go on the other side. Yeah, I want a nice tree. Lives right there. There he comes. Yeah, and he's got a little
friend, named Harriet. It's right there. Just make up little names
for bushes and trees. I know people look at you
like you're a little weird. That's okay. 'Cause as artists we can do anything. People expect us to be a little different. They expect it. Don't let 'em down (laughs). There, all right. Here and there take a little
black, a little white, and make a little gray. I think I'll have a little
gray tree trunk showing right in here somewhere. Maybe on the other side, just indication here and
there so it's not left out. We'll put leave on there, so not a lot of 'em is gonna show. Don't worry about 'em,
don't worry about 'em. Hmm, see, we'll grab us a fan brush. We'll go through sap green, right into some yellow, cad yellow, a little indian yellow, whatever. Just mix 'em on the brush. 'Kay, let's go up here
and put a few highlights on our evergreen trees. Took-a-chock-a-chook-chook-chook All right, next little tree. Don't cover up all the dark
when you're doing this. I know it gets feelin' good and it's sort of a tendency
just to cover it all up. Try to avoid covering it all up. Keep 'em dark. Let's take a little bit of that sap green, and some yellow, and load up a one-inch brush. A lot of color, turn that
rounded corner to the top. Then we go right up in here and we can begin picking out
little trees, where they live. There they are, doodle-oot-doo. There he comes, there's the little tree. Lives right there. Let's go on the other side, make a big tree over here. Big old tree, here he comes. But just don't get in a hurry. Do one little part at a time. Think about, think about the limb that's projecting one
way or another to create that protrusion in the tree. Don't just knock 'em on at random. Just think about it. Make friends with it. There's nothing wrong with
makin' friends with a tree. Shoot, people look at
you like you're weird, but that's okay. As I say, we're artists. We can do that kinda stuff. There, a few little
bushes that live in there. Gonna get really crazy. Let's go in this liquid white. Hey, I don't do this very often but I thought today, I'll
take a little indian yellow, a little, a lot of bright red. Let's build us a firecracker, whew, an eye-knocker. I mean jack frost has worked on this tree, big time. Big time. As I say, I don't do that very often. I'm gonna go more into
the yellow this time. More into the indian yellow. I want one over here, too, just sorta... just so this side feels like
it's got a little bright tree. Jack Frost maybe hit both sides. There we go. Now, if this side is too bright for ya, don't put it in, change the color. I just wanna show you what can be done. Sometimes it's nice to put
a sparkler in a painting. Sometimes. A few little doers that live there. Took-a-took-a-took. All right, I wanna live there. So, we need a little cabin. Just a quick little cabin. If you have a place this
gorgeous with all this color, you'd have to live there. Let's take brown, van dyke,
dark sienna mixed together. Put in the back eve. Shoom, put in the roof. This is just a very simple little cabin. Shoot, you can do this one easy. Still using our browns. We'll fill it in a little bit. Chook-chook-thook. I'm gonna put some bushes over it. Don't even have to worry about that. Take a little sienna,
white, mix it together. Just some indications. Something like that. And maybe the roof on this cabin, we'll take a little bright red. Let's get crazy. A little bright red. Pa-choo. Since we have red in this
painting, what the heck. Let's just get really crazy. A little bit over in there. Take a little dark
color, cut through there. Make it look like some old boards. I need a door, gotta have a door. There we go, swoop, door. Put a little touch of light
color around the edges. Shoot, we might behind
this little tiny cabin. Not the best cabin in the world, but it'd be a place to, if you were out here, and get
cold, it'd be good enough. All right. Now then. We'll just take some of that same color, and let it just hang
right over a little bit. Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo. Now, here's a happy little bush. Changed brushes on ya. I am changing brushes, in
case you don't catch that, between the red and the greens. I am changing brushes. I should have mentioned that earlier. I didn't there. But normally I would change brushes just so they don't get
contaminated with each other. Okay. A little land mass right there. Something like so. Shoot, maybe it comes
right on around, who knows? 'Bout like that. And out in here. There. All right. 'Kay, another little bush. Do one bush at a time when you're painting these little rascals. Don't get greedy and try
to get 'em all at once. (laughs) I know it's tempting. I do know it's tempting. There's one. 'Kay, maybe... Let's go into some black, a little blue. Let's punch in a, maybe
there's a happy little bush that lives right here on the water's edge. We can do that. I'll make some darker reflections then. Pull it straight down, go gently across. Just, just enough to sorta
give it a watery feel. Add a little liquid white to my color. Sap green, yellows. Go right in here, and we'll just pop in a little bush. There. Another one lives here. Wherever you think they should be. Wherever, wherever, doesn't matter. They just grow wherever. Wherever the seeds happen
to fall, and they come up, and off they go. We can just bring this, let me get a little more paint,
didn't have enough paint. Just bring this little thing, maybe there's a little land area, it just comes, choom. Right on around like that. You can do that. You can do that any way you wanna do it. There we go, see there. Something about like that. Go back in here and begin scratching in some little sticks and twigs. Wherever you want 'em. You make the decision. Maybe a few on this side, too. Wherever, there we are. Shoot, let's take a little
touch of the liquid white. Let me clean off a little spot here. I got paint everywhere. There, I'm gonna hafta
end it with a palette that's about four feet
across before it's over with. Take a little liquid white
and we'll cut across it. And with that, I'm gonna
make a little water line. Just a little indication. I don't want a strong water
line in this painting. Just enough to sort of clean
up the edges a little bit. There we are. There we are, wherever
you think they should be. Something like so. All right. We can put a little ripple
on the water here and there. Now, these water lines and ripples both. Keep 'em basically straight. Or it'll make your water, even at like here, we came down a hill, but notice these lines
are basically straight. If you don't do that, you're
water's gonna look like it's gonna run right outta
the side of your painting and you may have to tie a
bucket on the side to catch it. Don't wanna hafta do that. A few little indications here and there. Shoot, I think we about
have a finished painting. Well, let's find our
little script liner brush. Take a little paint thinner,
with the bright red. I think this one's ready for a signature. Luckily I have a very short name. Doesn't take but a second. Hope you've enjoyed this little painting. It'll give you a lot of experience using all of the equipment, basically. It'll teach you a tremendous amount. If you do it, if you take the time, send us a photograph. Let us see what kind of work
that you're turning out. Maybe on one of the earlier shows you saw that we put a lot
people's photographs on the air, so everyone can see 'em. And I'd like to see yours there, too. Until then, from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (mellow music)
