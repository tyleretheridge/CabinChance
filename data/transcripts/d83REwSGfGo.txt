hey welcome back I'm certainly glad you join me again today today let's do a fantastic little painting and I tell you what let's start out camera and all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along while they're doing it take a look up here at what I've done already today I've got an oval cut out of contact paper and stuck on my canvas we we've got so many letters saying how how much people like this I thought I'd do another one today now if at home if you're doing this and you don't like the oval on your painting just leave it off easy then I've covered the inside of the canvas here inside of this oval with a thin even coat the liquid white and it's all ready to go so let's go let's do a happy little painting today such a fantastic day I'm gonna start with a small amount of that they low blue just a small amount a small amount reach up here and grab a touch of Prussian blue just gonna mix them together on the same brush okay let's go right up here have it just using our standard little crisscross strokes let's just begin dancing in a happy little sky just let the brush play and have fun just bounce around there we are really don't have to plan this just sort of let it happen and look at what happens and use it learning to use whatever happens now then without cleaning the brush I'm going to add the least little touch these little touch then take much of phthalo green okay now then I just want to add a little touch of the green here just to Sparkle and bright in the sky just to give him some nice color so they're just a fiddle brush play and bouncing there we go add it all we have the old brush dirty this takes them oh it takes impression blue they go blue a little green just all of them same colors we used in the sky and let's put in the indication of a little touch of water down here there just pull it on the outside in like so I don't know exactly how much water we're going to have or even where it's going to be so we just cover it all up with whatever we don't we'll put something else over it because we can do anything and our world we can do anything okay let's wash your brush scrub it off there we are shake off the excess and cover the whole studio again - how did you see my cameraman there and camera ladies they are just to get funny freckles all over her face there now with clean dry brush clean dry brush I'm just going to blame the sky now you can blend it to any degree of softness that you want I like to leave some of these little patchy areas in the sky but if you don't want them in yours blend them out the more you blend it the smoother and softer it will become down here just gently go across sad easy and we can wash our old brush one more time shake it okay tell you what today let's use the old fan brush go right into some titanium white low love a lot of paint into the bristles a lot of paint a lot of pain let's build a happy little cloud in this guy maybe there lives a cloud right there wherever you want wherever just drop him in it's your sky so you make the decision or your clouds live there maybe yeah there's a little friend that lives right there right there right there maybe another one right over in here you can just get crazy and fill the whole sky up full of clouds and that's all right so all right with a good dry brush use just the top corner of the two-inch brush to very lightly blend see all your blending is the base then you lift it fluff it to use it and very lightly see there beautiful little cloud that easy same thing fluff it up give it a little blending there Buffett and blended tank maybe in your world maybe there's another look cloud lives in front of this one you can put here me and I suggest though if you're going to put layers of cloud on clouds on top of one another that you do the one that's farthest away first get it totally finished and then come back and put the other one over the top I'd certainly certainly makes it easier there okay you do that many clouds in your painting it'll that will give you some good practice doing clouds should never have problems with them again fluff it and very lightly two hairs and some air there we go Buffett we blend it and we can just gently blend the entire sky and already you've got a world full of clouds all right yeah they were cleaning out the fan brush - right and reshawna on a paper towel to dry it or a soft rag whatever you have to have okay just take two let's get this little big brush out here and take some black some blue we just mix them on the brush it doesn't matter Van Dyke Brown we'll be right back lizard crimson will throw some of that in there shoot a little SAP green - what the heck well use all these nice dark colors tap some color into the bristles let's go right up here and you have to make some big decisions maybe there's some happy little trees that live back here just take the corner of the brush and begin tapping start at the base because that's your darkest area and work upward work upward upward up or didn't begin begin creating some shape and forming a tree there we go see think about individual trees so where they live give them names if necessary that's alright there's one okay okay there he is there okay maybe we just let that work its way right on down here's a shoot there's another one you knew he was there didn't you maybe that's a nice when he comes we up like him and trees grow however make them happy just just put them in your world there we go let's just keep going keep that spot I'd be open here maybe over here more trees there we are maybe this one comes we have like it make a decision drop it in anywhere you wanting to be that's where you'll be there that quick you blocked him a whole forest back here nearly had it oh we had that color on the brush we can decide back here where our reflections are going to live grab pull straight down straight down you can drop them in then pull them see they're that easy try to kill that little bright spot right there that's pretty there you go like that now very lightly just go across just gives it a watery appearance and you can push these the wigglin that fantastic well as traditional painter reflections used to drive me crazy and that's one of the easiest things that you can do so simple just put some new tree trunks I'll take paint thinner and you get some more thinner here paint thinner on my liner brush and I wanna mix this to it's thin like ink let's go right up here and now here and there just put the indication of a happy little tree trunk and some blooms and sticks or some and grow in here some people find it easier to start start at the top and pull down some people find it easier to start at the bottom and lift up doesn't matter that matter there's no rule if it works then that's the right way okay maybe there's one sort of yeah Holly over here oh that means it's bent there okay over this side we need some indications in each one doesn't have to have one just wherever you think they should be they're just all kinds of little things grown in there and you can take a little bit of titanium white them down and put a few of them in here and there that are light color and they really stand out against that dark sea in case your painting character hmm people think you really work for a long time to put all them little rascals and let's put someone that said it was looking good I know they were that good I don't put a bunch of near the stern well there look at that why not little devils just jump right out at you now they're clean my brush I'm gonna get a a one-inch brush today what the heck let's go I'm going to drag it through some of the dark color first just to get some paint on it some browns and greens and all that then they'll go into the CAD yellow be right back get a little SAP green on it load a lot of color into the brush but tap it so you can see see it push there tap it to load it on okay now then let's go up here and begin putting in some highlights on some of these little devils think about form and shape don't just throw a minute random they won't look right no matter how you paint highlights on bushes and trees think about them as individuals I think about them it's easy just to throw them in at random but that's that's not the way little trees grow it grab new yard neat and look at them there's a plan there they do doesn't make any mistakes it happens for a reason as limbs and things in there that project out there think about them create all these little shapes there had a little yellow ocher here in their little Indian yellow SAP green CAD yellow just whatever they even touch a little bright red here and there just make some pretty little things and over here on this one let's give him something to him left out over here think about form and shape though I know you get tired of hearing that but to me that's so important anybody can just hit it random but your paintings are special they're special set you apart from everybody else because you to pay attention to little details that makes you special and if you're selling your paintings that'll cause your paintings to sell while somebody else's are setting they're going nowhere there we go for years and years I traveled with art shows all over the country demonstrating and selling my works oh and some sometimes other painters would get so angry with me because I'd be some paintings just passed as I could turn them out and they would sit there all day brooding over these little paintings and if only they had just taken the time to figure out why they were selling rather than being angry you don't have to get angry if somebody's doing better than you are study them they've got a secret find out what it is shoot don't get angry if you get angry it just wastes a lot of energy tell you what tell you what let's get crazy today I'm gonna take take a little white or read to be right back get a little touch of phthalo blue since this is my world I can do anything I want to do here and I'll go up here and maybe back in here there's a little bush this sort of a blue Asia I just like the looks of that see there if you don't want a bush that color to your world don't buddy man but today I just feel so super I want to put some bright shiny little colors here no add a little lizard crimson to that little crimson make woo there's a beautiful color beautiful color okay now that maybe look at that just makes you happy when you see bright little colors like yet it just can't help it there we go and painting that does nothing else for you it shouldn't make you happy should bring something into your life that you didn't have there before and it's worthwhile then it's good it's good anything it makes you happy it doesn't hurt anybody else it's got to be good okay let's go right up here I'm going to add a little dirt bank back here using straight Van Dyke Brown you know straight around right along here see wherever you want them to go take a little brown and a little white mix it together and come right back in here touch a highlight right here there there we go just not get it to stand out a little touch of liquid white and put a little bit of that lavender color that to will make it pretty so you pull it out flat and then cut across just get a little bit on your knife go right up here cut a hole right through the camp just get a paired saw it just really working there and that's a light area between the darks that makes it stand out a little bit shoot we might even we might even get in here and get crazy because we know anything in our world maybe there's some more bushes and trees here see maybe there's a little projection that comes out here if you won't want pudding man you don't need him out can do anything there see there he is put a little reflection straight down for cross come back with our one inch brush get a little color on him just tap a little cover into it let's go back up there yeah needs a few highlights on this little bush or tree whatever he is here there we go see that there is at least bark areas in there sometimes this gets working so well it's almost a natural tendency Vista to cover up everything and if you do that if you lose those dark areas and your little bushes are not going to be individuals and they're going to be very flat look like you cut them out of newspaper just glue them up there and we want one action of life who this is too nice see there but layer after layer after layer then we need a little dirt into there can I have something from sit on little height little brown put in a little touch of highlight right in here I can't I'm going to take a little fan brush with some of that same color on it and just push upward to that'll bring it all together cover up those edges back there come back with our liquid light cut us in a little water line silver gun and with a clean knife we just scrape in the indication hearing their funeral sticks and twigs just mainly in the dark areas there see that looks like a lot of little detail and people really think you worked hard to put all that yeah thank you use a a little one here brush and did them one at a time don't you tell them a difference that's our secret that's our secret okay tell you i get some more blue and some black and some Van Dyke Brown white over the color SAP green lizard crimson we just mix them all in here okay now that maybe this comes right down I can't see they're just use the corner to brush and tap in whatever you want okay if that comes out here obviously let's go to your reflection you do that go across you need to put that reflection in I'm going to bring this down put it down before you come around it's hard to sneak it back in there you have to make some decisions see maybe that's going to come right out like yeah and be hard to sneak back in there and stick out reflection yeah but you got it already you got it there we can come right back find my brush there it is let's go back into our highlight colors the yellows all the different yellows and a little bit of SAP green and we can look there go right back in here just begin adding all kinds of little little bright things up here one bush at a time don't get in too big a hurry we got all day we're not in a hurry take your time speed will come automatically the more you practice the faster you'll become without even thinking about it don't worry about speed at first if you're painting along with me if you have a video record the shows and play them back at your own speed so you can stop them and start them as you know here I have a very limited amount of time to work so I have to do them sort of quick I'm over 30 minutes they they have no sense of humor we got one cameraman here weighs about 250 he comes out and drags me off the set but at home you can do anything that you want to do see working layers layer after layer after layer I know what we need let's take a leaf and a fan brush shoot that's just that's just a perfect place perfect place to have a little path because you'd want to get back in there and a little path there comes and if it goes right over your bushes that's all right there it comes right out do they see it sort of goes back take that same brush we'll pick up a little white on it there see just let it graze over the top of that dark there you go a little way to get back in there can I have way to catch a big trout that lives back here in the water there I'm not a very good fisherman I'd love to fish I catch a fish now but a bait that you don't even buddy back in the water and wishing well and hope I can have the opportunity to catch him again next time I come there yes like so maybe a few little things right in here okay we can take our liner brush and put a little thinner on it and let's just put the indication here and there a few little sticks and twigs that are growing out of this just a few things here and there back to our Brown add a little dirt under this side told him left out put a brown and white for highlight and then a little water line underneath that cleans up the bottom and puts a little light area between all of it there look at that okay take a clean and just scrape in a few little sticks here in there like so and these things show different planes and I create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting and I'm a nut for that I think the depth in painting is so important tell you what let's bring the camera right up here close I'm going to take the contact paper off and let's see what we have and grab this and here's the moment of truth Oh yep pretty Sun again I'm always fascinated with us there's so nice so nice tell you what let's do we got up minute or two left here so let's get crazy maybe this comes right on out I like to bring them right out of the right out of the oval Sun time so here we just bring a little bit of the color right on out like so this is scary too when you do this this is your bravery test and this will check you out okay have it take our fan brush put some brown on it first thing this do let's just extend our path our path comes right on out like that take a little bit of white put a highlight on it just barely grazing barely crazy yeah take her here's a few little bushes and they come over the path allowing some of those bushes to come literally over the top of the path it pushes a path of doubt into the painting makes it look like he fits in there there we go just sort of let those just feather right on off into nothing there it guy was one tear you there is an unbelievable that just using the corner of a one-inch brush you can do all that you can that's the easiest way I have ever found to make little bushes grassy areas let's get crazy we get we got to get crazy and we'll take Van Dyke Brown on the fan brush load a lot of color a lot of color now they may be right here you know me I like these old big trees and I'm gonna let this tree project right out of the painting soon and he lives right there and he's got a friend he's got a friend and he lives there see yeah that would take a little touch-up white and let's just say maybe these are birch trees touch him give them a little little round brick pull do there you go just give it a little pull don't get too big there okay and then a little pink there on my liner brush we'll make some more that paint this thin like ink canvas go up in here and now then let's just put a tree limb hair in there and in your tree you put as many or as few as you want just let them go wherever you think they should live now if your paint does not flow that's more thinner to it because a thin paint will slide right over all this maybe that one goes right on off we don't know there see there I'm gonna put some leaves on there so you don't have to be too careful and this maybe you want to treat in your painting to be an old dead tree then you ain't got to be a little bit more careful there okay maybe this one right there wherever wherever and you will just use the old big brush what the heck paring there I just want to put the indication of a little leaf or two just indication here and there I'm not looking for a lot of shape hit will come back and highlight them in a second there you need that dark in order for your light to show now we'll take some light color I'm going to dip the brush into the least little amount of paint thinner to thin the paint come right along in here like a death like a time-sharing in the Sun there they go didn't that super I love these paintings where they extend outside of the oval I hope you try out and you're not limited to ovals you can do any shape that you want to do any shape that you want to do just enjoy them and I think with that we're gonna call that a completed painting from all of us here happy painting and God bless Oh you Oh ah you
