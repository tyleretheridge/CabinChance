you hello I'm truly glad you could join me that you ready to do a fantastic little painting good tell you what let me show you what I've done up here I've got my standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas but you use any size canvas you want for your painting and I've covered it with a thin even coat of the liquid white so it's all ready to go tell you what let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and they'll come across as usual in the same order as I have moment palette starting with a titanium white and working around and while they're doing that shoot let's go up here and get started then we'll start with just a small amount I tell you what let's start with a little tiny tiny touch of the bright red and you need very little of this color it's quite strong there we go just tap a little into the bristles now then I thought today we'd do a just a warm happy little painting it's such a super day so let's just take make little criss-cross strokes and that's just laying there we go just a little bit of pink in the sky a little touch of pink I'd be very careful this red is so strong and it'll look like there's a fire in the sky so use a very small amount very small amount you can always add more but it's a son of a gun to try to take it out it can if you have to but it's hard to do there we go and this is continually blending with a liquid white and it gets lighter and lighter a lava allow the liquid white to work for you hmm and as I say you can make it any degree of ripeness that you want now then without even cleaning the brush I'm going right into a small amount of the phthalo blue and just tap a little bit of that into the bristles just a small amount once again these colors are very strong it takes a very little paint okay now this still using a little crisscross strokes let's just begin laying in some light blue areas around this pink just sort of let your imagination go here and you decide where you want it to be just like so this let it blend together but don't cover up the pink the blue is many many times stronger than the pink you you just eat it up believe you maybe with a totally blue sky okay maybe over in here we want a little bit like so let's see how you can take this with us do it right here you can take this blue and go right over the paint and the way it goes it'll just go in leave you there can maybe you want to put the indication here and there of just a happy little cloud that floats out here all you have to do is take some of this and just tap it and you can bring all kinds of little projections out into your sky wherever you want wherever that you want maybe over in here shoot us have some bigger bigger ones over here just sort of let them then I'll just work off the brush have fun with it enjoy I say over and over again and I'm very sincere about it painting should make you happy should just make you heart full of joy now very lightly very lightly here all we have to do is just blend all this and you can bring all this together and then all we have that blue on the brush you know me and my water I'm crazy about water so let's take a little of the blue just tap a little on there and let's go right down here I don't know exactly where we're going to have water yet but fast just lay some on anything that we we don't want we just cover up because this is our world here and you can create any kind of illusion that we want don't worry about it don't worry about it we don't we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents and it's very good to keep that in mind it'll it'll it'll get over worrying about maybe I've done something wrong or just just enjoy it can you wash your brush with odorless thinner shake off the excess and just beat the devil at it I'm going back into a little touch of the bright red and maybe right in here in this area left light I'll put a little tiny amount of the rift takes very little color and will let a little that sky color just reflect right down in here and then very lightly three hairs instant air we can blend all this together and in the sky you can blend this where the blue and the pink come together just blend it until you can't tell where one color stops and the next color starts just using little crisscross strokes just very soft it and when you're doing this at home stand back and take a look see sometimes when you right up closest it's hard to tell exactly what something looks like stand back and look at it move back maybe five six feet there we go okay and that quick we have a nice little sky it's a very simple sky and you can do it with absolutely no problem let's make a little mountain today and today let's make a mountain that looks like it's far far off in the distance and one of the ways you do that is by size so I'm going to take some black midnight black some Van Dyck Brown and we'll put a little lizard and crimson into it time black Browning little crimson pull that out as flat as you can get it really getting strong with it and take your knife and just cut across as all there is to it and you get that little roll of paint right out of the edge of the knife now then you have to make your first major decision where does your mountain live once again we want to keep these mountains quite small so let's go right up in here and say maybe there's a little peak it lives there come right on up see wherever you want to take and you're using a lot of pressure get tough with it this is where you take out all your frustrations and your hostilities they're just really push this right into the fabric there we go Jane you scrape off all the excess paint the value or the color is going to be in the material you can get it off now if you want off it's just subtly going to try to get that off okay now with our big brush grab it and just firmly pull it just pull it because it's wet underneath the paint will move it'll slide see there this is also a good way to lay out your highlights and shadows without being committed you can sort of see here where your brushstrokes go it gives you an idea of how your mountains going to look and then we'll just blend the base of it out till it just floats there any sky one just look like it's just hanging up here in the mist and now we can come back and begin putting in all of our little highlights and stuff and today it's not use we use a small knife some dark Sienna dark Sienna I'm going to be right back and get a little bright written and put in there may be at least little touch of yellow ochre and pull it out a very flat don't over mix it leave it sort of marble maybe a little white here and there see that way you have all these colors happening then cut across and you get that little roll of paint but all those various color mixtures are also in that little roll of paint now then no pressure no pressure just let the knife float right down the mountain no pressure at all silly absolutely no pressure and we can take and just grab a little debt and all we're doing here is using a clean knife sort of rub it in at a little I want to pull a little that color down we can add a little touch of blue here and there to give a little shadow effect and just let it drift right on down now they're at the large brush I'm gonna tap that I want to creep miss cuz I want to push that part of the mountain back you can play little games when you're doing mountains you can you can push parts of it way back into the distance but the way you do that is with these misty areas down here at the base and then when we bring another layer over the top here let's start right here just let that slide right on down when you bring this one down directly in front it'll it'll look like it's in the foreground so you get all these different colors just sort of happening just sort of happening here and they'll fight them there we picked up quite a bit of white just sort of let these things happen there okay add in once again I want to miss this area just create that little soft misty area some of our dark color go back in here and create some heavy dark shadows in there we want to see they're in that fantastic it's a super easy nice way to make some very effective little mountains I'll tell you what let's do let's get crazy maybe there's a little peak it lives right there then maybe there we just sort of let it come right in front let's see how it pushes all that back and you can do this and just create a layer after layer after layer of mountains I was going to have a small mountain here and it just keeps growing but that's alright that's that's the way to learn make a lot of mountains practice over and over if there's a secret to this technique or to any technique of painting it's practice devote some time to practice you know I sincerely believe you could have anything in this world that you want if you willing to pay the price and the price for this is practice that's all anybody can do it if you're willing just to spend a little time of practicing and you'll be amazed at how quick it works for you there now then maybe today on this little mountain tell you what maybe there's a little grassy things that grew up there I'll just use this little two inch brush take a little SAP green a little yellow and just tap it just tap like so okay that maybe maybe there's some nice little grassy areas and go right up the side of this mountain look at there but follow the angles in that Mount that's most most important there we go to yellow ochre and Indian yellow add it here and there shoot this one here we'll just let it drift right on off and you're picking up the mountain color just mixing with that so it all looks like it flows together is all natural looks right there okay and we can just let that grow and grow and every once in a while pick up a little dark color work that in two so there's differences as light in this dark and you can always go back and add more little bumps or rocks and stones see there it's not easy you can just continually add all these little things a little touch a highlight here and there so it stands out now for the same colors we can grab that just the base of it and begin blending that out see and from the other side there it goes and all of a sudden that little that little projection he fits in there he belongs everybody needs to belong somewhere there okay Mike a little darker green here same colors but a little darker green will sort of let that blow up the backside here but you can just set a beautiful mountain right out here and and this little grassy areas without very much problem like so okay and the more you tap this the softer it'll get you can make it think I've mentioned before you could make it too it looks absolutely like velvet just a nice place to sit and look at some of nature's masterpieces hmm I get carried away here sometime now tell you what let's put some reflections under that I'll go right in to we'll use a little black a little blue and just a couple of colors here on the brush just tapping now then decide where you want your reflections to be and grab and pull straight down it's important that you pull straight down so let's give it a little pull reflections used to drive me crazy and now they're one of the easiest things that we do there we go because on this wet canvas the paint will move and you can make it as dark or as light as you want now very lightly just go across this will give it the shimmer the glitter it looks like water and that easy you have instant reflections there we go that's fantastic now we take a little touch I'm going to use some panda brown there's a tiny bit of dark CIA into it okay cut off our little roll of pain again that little roll of pain is so important it really will are you great dividends if you practice and learn to load the knife correctly and just just get in the habit of loading at that same way each time and that easy you can just scrub in a little bit of land out here all I'm doing it just sort of scrubbing there I think I'll put a big tree over there so I don't have to worry about that and it a little bit of liquid light you know me and my big trees I like big trees I'm gonna take a liquid light and just lay in the indication of a little water line under this land area like so act like you're trying to cut a hole in the canvas there and sometimes maybe you'd like to have a little just a vacation of a little ripple here now how you do is just just cut some across but all of them should remain basically straight if they're not straight and they're going to look like they're gonna run right out of here right out of your painting so tell you what let's go into some of this dark color we had left pick up some Van Dyke Brown will get a little SAP greener - what the heck mainly dark color so that's what you're looking for and it's time to make some big decisions in your world I tell you I tell you what maybe right here there's a landmass so we'll start off and there's some there's some trees and shrubs and stuff live there we go there we go see there just let these things happen so look at your painting and decide who you want to treat a live I think maybe a tree would be very happy if he lived right out here so that's a good place to put him just sort of look around in your world and decide what you think I think we're true you'd be happy or bush or house just let's just sort of look around yeah then we'll have another tree right here we need to cover up that area it's important to me to leave a little bit of this showing through so I don't leave that showing through that way you can see distance behind this maybe this tree just maybe he just comes right there and underneath here this will be reflections and we're not committed chipping we can make these reflections anywhere we want to just take a clean 2 inch brush and pull straight down wherever you decide reflection should be and go across hmmm that easy catch instant reflections now then we can take her we'll just use the fan brush to take a little dark sienna and a little white just mix together and let's just draw this through the tree then we make a make a little tree trunk maybe we can only see a little bit of that way it goes on off the canvas maybe this one has two in it who knows you put as many or as few as you want now we need some we need some nice leaves on there to brighten it up so I'll take the 1 inch brush dad you could do this with a 2 inch brush or fan brush I'll tap it into some color like so just tapping it's sort of giving a little push say tap give a little push okay and it let's go up here and use just the corner of the brush and just begin laying out some beautiful Italy worried about shape and form here I know you've heard me say it over and over but it's important shape and form don't just throw these on at random they're of a yellow ocher indeed yellow CAD yellow SAP green I'd like to just bury these colors over and over so million different colors you can make okay and a little maybe a little touch of the bright red to that yeah give the sparkle little but a little a little highlights on this little son of a gun over here don't worry left out and a little more of the green and maybe down here on these bushes you can use this brush or whatever whatever put all kinds of little things in and just vary the colors there and you can reflect a little listen to the water back so and take your large brush in very lightly just graze it give it a little downward pull and go across and it gives the indication of some reflections in there just enough to make it nice we can go back to Van Dyck Brown dark sienna mixture and let's put in a happy little land area underneath here in same way as we did up here we describe this here just act like you're trying to rub it right through wherever you want to a little bit of the liquid white maybe then we can put in a just a little water line underneath there we go take a clean knife and go back in here normally the dark areas in between these bushes just put in the indication of little little sticks and twigs and helps create the illusion of depth in your painting distance between each bush we need something over here let's get crazy I'm going to use them same old colors we had some SAP green some black Van Dyck Brown lizard crimson whatever you got okay let's go right up in here make a big decision maybe there it is where you're going to have a big something things are right here and all you have to do is just start out and tap in a basic shape that son of a guns are growing on me there and that's all right it's really the way to learn just throw them in don't worry about and then make a painting out of it used to when I was teaching I would have students just taking sort of turn their head away from the way from the canvas and hit it with a big gob of color and turn that their project for the day was to make a beautiful painting that's one of the most fantastic ways I've ever found to learn them just how to compose paintings into to work with anything it happens try that sometime you have an old canvas at home to stock some color on it and go from that and turn into a beautiful painting you'll love what happens okay go back to my fan brush we use to make the trunk and let's tell you what let's have a trunk of Leo's see right there I have to make those little noises or don't work maybe this one he's got a crook any get tired of seeing all of them just be perfectly straight when you take paint thinner a little Bandag Brown and here and there add the indication of a few little limbs that are living here see wherever you want them or as many or as few there see there and if you if you have trouble making your paint flow then means your pain is just it's not quite thin enough remember a golden rule then paint will stick to a thick pan back to my one-inch brush here just going to tap some color into it like so a little bright red little yellow ocher CAD yellow let's go right up in here and put some nice little things that live out here on this tree once again work with form and shape oh I know you tire them but if you out here selling paintings that's what that's what brings a happy buck home these individual shapes and forms they're up here on this one you little thanks to want him left out shoot these I know guns are getting mad if you don't treat them all the same they all want some beautiful little leaves and some bright Sparkle zone there we go the other thing that will help in your painting leave some dark areas underneath there's usually a big shadow because all this stuff down here stops the light so leave some shadows or some darker areas underneath it'll help create that illusion of the dark areas now that we can begin oh maybe there's some happy little bushes that live right in here wherever you wanna and you can just sort of drop these in oh there's a nice one there's a nice one okay like so just wherever and layer but the ones is farthest away and work forward that creates the illusion of distance and here and there you can take a little brown and just lay it in see make it look like his little dirt chillin and then put some some happy little bushes all around that then that's something the old clock on the wall is telling me it's about time to go for today but I really hope you enjoyed this painting it'll teach you a great deal make you become very comfortable with the equipment and allow you to experience the joy of painting and from all of us here happy painting and God bless you
