(gentle music) - Welcome back, I'm glad to see you today, glad you could join me. And today I thought we'd do something a little bit different. I think you'll enjoy it. But before we start I'm gonna have them run all the colors that
you need across your screen and they'll come across in the same order that I have them on the palette. Starting with the titanium white and working around. And today I've started
with a canvas that's dry, it has no magic white on it, nothing, yet. We'll put some on later, but we're gonna start off with a canvas that's very, very dry. Okay, and I wanna use a large brush and go right into some burnt umber and beat a little bit into the bristles. Just a small amount, it's all we need. And let's go right up in here and I'm just gonna scrub a little bit of this burnt umber color right onto the canvas. Just scrub it on. Very, very thin coat. Just let it go, have fun with it. There. See how easy that is? Let's go right into a
little bit of thalo blue. Just a small amount. This blue is very, very strong. And work it into the bristles, beat that brush on there, that way you get a nice
even distribution of color all the way through the bristles. Okay, now let's go right up here and we'll put a little bit of the blue. Now I didn't clean the brush, so we have blue and brown on the brush, but the blue is so much stronger you will still see blue. There we go. Just really work that in. I don't wanna kill all the brown. Don't wanna kill it all, there. Okay, now I'll clean the brush, and we clean our brush with
odorless paint thinner. And I really suggest that you
use odorless paint thinner or you're gonna be working by yourself. You'll run everybody in the house out. There we go, and we beat the bristles dry. Now let's go back up in here and very lightly, very lightly, we'll just blend all this together. Now you can probably hear the strokes because the canvas is dry. Usually we have a wet canvas and the paint and the
brush just glide over it, but today we're using a dry canvas, so you're gonna hear the
strokes a little bit more. There. And that's a super way to make a very effective little sky very easy, very, very easy. Okay, now I'm gonna go right
into some titanium white with a fan brush and really load a lot of
paint into the bristles, there we go, a lot of paint. Let's go up to the canvas. And we'll put a happy little
cloud right up in here. And maybe he lives right there. Very little pressure, just let it bounce around and play. I'm using just the corner of the fan brush and pushing quite hard. And you want areas that are thick, areas that are thin, areas that have absolutely no paint. Okay, now we can form our cloud. You have to make a basic cloud shape. You can't just take and throw on paint and expect a (mumbling)
cloud just to appear. You need a basic shape. Okay, we'll use that for our basic shape and I'll take a large brush and I'm gonna just, very
lightly, blend the bottom out. Just blend it out. Just want the bottom to
basically just disappear and pick up some of the brown and the blue that we have under there. Don't touch the top at all yet. Not yet, we will in a minute. Okay, there we go. There we go, just let all these
little things just happen. Now I'm gonna fluff it, just lift it up, fluff
it, fluff it, fluff it. And I beat the brush just
to remove excess paint and then we'll, very
lightly, just blend it. There we go. And that's all there is to it. Gives you a very effective,
quiet little cloud that's far away and soft. Alright, now on the bottom of the canvas I'm gonna cover that with magic white. and I'm just using the old dirty brush and allowing those colors to mix. It's got a little brown,
a little blue on it, and a little cloud color, whatever, it doesn't matter. There we go. Now I've completely covered
the bottom with magic white, so now the bottom's wet and slick and we can actually blend
color right on the canvas. I'll let that come
right up into the color. That'll create a nice misty
area when we're finished. Okay, now we can wash the brush. There we go. There, that's the most fun part of all. That's where you take
out all your frustrations and hostilities. Okay, I'm gonna get another, another fan brush. I have several going here, so I don't have to stop
and wash them all the time. And I go into a small
amount of thalo blue, little bit of alizarin crimson, and I've left paint thinner on the brush, so this paint is very, very thin. Very thin. Very thin. Okay, let's go right up in here and I'm gonna drop just
some little indications far away, barely touching the canvas. Just want some little indications of distant, distant trees. Very soft, quiet, happy. Just let 'em play, have fun. Now you let these go
wherever you want 'em, because, you know, when you
buy your first tube of paint you get that artist license and it says you can do anything, anything that you want on canvas. You have absolute power here, so you create your world
the way you want it. We just wanna show you how to make effects and turn you loose. Just turn you loose. There. Okay, now take the large brush and I wanna create some mist
down here at the bottom, so gently tap. And here it's beginning to
mix with that magic white, it'll get very soft. If you were using a dry canvas here it wouldn't mix, wouldn't mix. You'd get a very harsh line. Barely hitting right here. There. And the more mist you want
the harder you hit it. And you bring that color down. You're looking for this soft area. Okay, and very lightly
I'll just lift upward, very lightly, very lightly. Just gently, gently caress it. There. Okay, now, now then, we'll put a couple of more layers and we need to mix up some color, so I'm gonna take some thalo green and alizarin crimson, about equal parts, and we'll mix those together. And when you're mixing paint pick it up off the
palette and turn it over. Otherwise what's against the palette never gets mixed. Pick it totally up, turn it over, there. Okay, I'm gonna clean my knife. We'll get another fan brush. I've just got all kind of
fan brushes going today. Little bit of paint thinner on the brush, so the paint's quite thin. Alright, let's go right up here and maybe right, we've
gotta make a decision. Now see, this color is black, so it'll stand out. But as it hits those other colors it's gonna begin to dilute a little bit and make all kinds of beautiful grey tones and ah, just unbelievable things happen. Let 'em happen, let 'em happen, don't fight with the canvas. You know, over and over I say, we don't make mistakes, we have happy accidents. And you learn to use
anything that happens, so let it happen, let it happen. You're depending on it. That's what makes it so fantastic. That's why we don't use
any patterns or tracings, we want it to happen on the canvas. We don't want any restrictions. We wanna just let it flow. Okay, now we'll take the large brush and then once again, I'm
gonna tap the bottom of this just to soften it, make it very quiet, very quiet. There. And gently, gently,
gently I'll lift upward. And see, each layer that you put in here creates another plane in your painting and creates more of the illusion of depth and pushes everything back. So the more planes that
you have in painting, the more depth that you'll have. Tell you what, while we
got that color going here maybe there's a tree that lives here that oh, maybe he got a lot of vitamins and really grew. Big evergreen that lives right there. Just a corner of the brush, back and forth, back and forth. Just let him come right out of your brush, he lives in there, but he hides sometime, you have to push him out. Just push him right out, there he comes, there he comes. Okay, now we can start, and I think I'll try a one inch brush. And we begin putting a little
bit of color back here. And we'll go into a small
amount of cad yellow, and sap green, and I'm gonna add a little
bit of brown to that, Van Dyke Brown to it to dull it. I don't want it too bright. Lot of color into the brush. Okay. Now back here we're just gonna see how lightly we can touch. We're just gonna touch. And you could use a two and
a half inch brush for this, or the one inch brush, whatever makes you happy. We're just gonna put
some little indications. Don't want too much detail, it's too far away, too far away right now. As we get closer then
we'll add more detail, but back here we don't want detail. Okay, I'm adding in a
little Indian yellow. Indian yellow's a beautiful color. Very transparent. Okay, I'll begin working on layers here. Just let all these little things happen, let 'em come off your brush. Still not looking for detail, just basic little shapes way back in the distance. And with my large brush, once again, once again, I'm gonna soften the bottom of these. We really want this painting
to be very soft, quiet, very gentle. And wipe and lift upward. Create that illusion of mist again. Okay, and that gives us a super, super nice little background that has a lot of depth in it, you can see plane after plane after plane, and once again, that's what creates the depth in your painting and gives you good feelings in here. Okay, let's begin working on some trees that are little closer. I'll go into some Van Dyke Brown, a little burnt umber, and just mix it on the
brush, mix it on the brush, don't worry about it. Maybe, here I'm just tapping, maybe there lives a nice tree right here. But you have to make these decisions. Since this is your world
you have to figure out where these trees live, 'cause they live wherever you want 'em. And all I'm doing here is just applying some very, very basic shapes. We're not looking for detail, just general shapes. There. Add a little alizarin crimson
to that color here and there, break it up some. So we got Van Dyke Brown, burnt umber, a little alizarin crimson. See, that quick, that quick we got a nice, nice, nice area to play with. Now we'll use a large brush and we'll go back and
we'll put some highlights on some of these. I'm gonna add a small amount
of paint thinner to my brush. And we'll go right into,
oh, there's some cad yellow, little yellow ochre, beautiful, little Indian yellow, and just mix all these
colors together on the brush, just mix them on the brush. We could even put a small, small amount of permanent red in there. That permanent red is very, very strong. A little sap green. Now we have layers of color in the brush, layers of color, so many things will happen, rather than just one old
dead color coming out, we're gonna have all kinds of beautiful little things happening and they're right here,
right here in this brush. Let's go right up here. All we're gonna do here is just tap and put some beautiful little leaves here. And I'm just using the
very corner of the brush. Just a corner. Just touch it and let these little things
just come right off your brush. They're there and keep varying color, just sort of go back and forth and play with the color. Let all these little things happen. There's one. Wherever you want 'em
that's where they live. Let 'em go, let 'em go. Okay, let's add a little
more of the sap green, tiny bit more. Put a nice little green one right there. Don't want him left out. And right there is a nice one. See how easy these are? These are probably some of
the simplest little bushes there are to make and they work so easy, anybody can do 'em. Anybody can do 'em. But you need to build layers, that's what creates the depth. You need layers. And you do one bush at a time, and you have that little
rascal totally finished before you go to the next one. If you try to do them all at once they're just gonna make mud for you. And I know sometime, 'cause we have to paint very fast on TV, it looks like we're just
running across a room and socking the canvas. It's a gentle touch and
it's one bush at a time. Just one at a time. Don't get in too big a hurry. Let it happen. Okay. Now, so I have several of these
two and a half inch brushes and I'll just tap the bottom here, create a little mist at these. Don't forget these brushes that we use are natural bristles, they're not nylon, or polyester, or any other man-made fiber, use natural bristle brushes, it's very, very important. Nylon will cut paint. We don't wanna cut it. Okay, there we go. See how all that blends together and makes all the beautiful, beautiful little misty area down here and it's that easy,
just let the brush work. Okay, now we need, if we're gonna put some foreground in here we need a dark color in order
that the light will show. You need dark in order to show light. You put light against
light you have nothing, dark against dark you have nothing. You need light against dark, dark against light. That's what creates all
the beautiful illusions and makes things stand out. So let's go, I'll go right into some of this black color that I made and we'll put a little brown in it, whatever, whatever, just let it happen. And we'll just tap in some. Oh, maybe it is a little hill here, maybe it comes up, there we go. Make a decision, just make a decision and go with it. Go with it, let it happen, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. And we'll just quickly,
quickly, quickly drop in some nice dark color. And maybe in your world maybe you decide there's another bush that lives right there. Wherever. Wherever. There are no rules. Bushes live wherever makes them happy and if they're happy there, that's where they wanna be. Maybe this one comes down, whatever. Okay, we'll just cover
all this up very quickly with a lot of dark color. Doesn't matter. As long as it's dark,
as long as it's dark. This is predominately a brown color, but if you have some lavender left over, black, just drop it in. Drop it in. Just needs to be dark, needs to be dark. And down here it needs to
be darker than back here. As things get closer to you in a landscape they should get darker. There we go. Okay. Now I'll go back to the brush
that had the color on it. This is a two and a half inch. And very lightly here I'll
load a little bit of color. And we'll come right down here and maybe, maybe there's some happy little grassy things that live here. And I'm just touching, tapping. See there how easy? And it makes beautiful
little grassy areas. And I use just the corner then
to put highlight on these, we've decided there was
another bush that lived there. So I use just a corner of the brush and put him some little
sparklers out there. There we go. There we go. And I think we, yeah, we
put another one over here, so I'll add a little bit of
permanent red to my color. Oh, let him just really stand out. He is a beauty. Okay, I'll drop in some more
of these little grassy areas. Wherever you want 'em. And make up your mind where you think light's gonna strike 'em and just tap. You know, that's such a
beautiful little place I'd like to have a little house there. And this is my world, so we could put anything we want. Maybe there's a little chalet out here. I like those. So I use the knife sometime and take off some of this excess paint and it'll, it will help you, it will really help you if you take off some of this thin loose paint. And it's also a nice way
to lay out a basic shape. A little chalet the roof
comes all the way down, carpenter didn't know when to stop, so he just made the roof all
the way down to the ground. So that's what we'll do. Now that give you a basic shape, allows you to lay out your
perspective a little bit and get it like you want it. Take some Van Dyke Brown and we'll do this back eave back here. Pull it straight across, straight across. See, like so. Now we need, now we need, let's put some paint in here. And all we're doing is just
laying in the base color, the under color. We will come back later and
highlight it and put shape in. Right now we're just laying in base color. If you like buildings in our third series we devoted nearly the whole series to showing you how to make all kinds of beautiful little buildings. So I think you'll enjoy it. There, now we'll put the
other side of the roof on, and straighten it up,
wherever you want it. And if it gets too long somewhere you can take your knife and cut it off. Boy, you have unlimited
power on this canvas. See, little chalet then we'll just zoom, cut it off. Now then we need, tell you what, let's take
a little permanent red, little Van Dyke Brown, mix it together. Permanent red, Van Dyke Brown. And I use a small edge of the knife and let's put a, tell you what, let's put a few little shingles on this. Maybe the come right here, touch, just lift upward. Touch, and we'll have
to start at the bottom and we'll work up. And it's just a super easy little way to make all kinds of little shingles. Come right on up like that. Let 'em go, wherever
you want 'em, wherever. And I'm gonna take a
little brown and white. Little brown and white. And we'll put there, just pull it down, let that paint break, no pressure, no pressure, no pressure at all. Barely touch. And I'll go back with some
straight Van Dyke Brown and we'll lay in some shadows. See, how you could just
play this back and forth. We create all kind of illusions. And we need a little door in here, so you have a way to get into your house. Just pull it across with Van Dyke Brown, take a little bit of color and go around the door. Maybe, maybe, maybe in this little chalet maybe there's a window
that lives right there. There, just Van Dyke Brown. Maybe there's one up top here, and one there. And we can take a little color and go around these. There, see how easy that is? And maybe there's boards. If you want the illusion of boards just take the point of the knife and cut right down through the paint. And it'll make it look like this house is made out of little boards. Okay. Little bit of white and we'll put a little there. Boy, that'll make it stand out so you can see it good. And there's our little
chalet all finished. Okay, let's add a little more color here. Get a tiny bit of paint
thinner on my brush. Thin paint will stick to thick paint. And let's put a little bit of grass coming right down through here. There it goes. Maybe comes right down, right down. There it is, there it is, there it is. Just make these decisions, let it happen. Tell you what, we need a
way to get to our cabin, chalet up here. Let's take a little Van Dyke Brown and let's put a, there it is, there it is, happy little path. Maybe this little path comes, there it is. There it is. Just sort of visualize, look at your painting, make decisions, let it happen. Let it happen. Flow right out. And we'll take a little
brown and white here and just barely, barely, barely touch and let that paint break. Put a little highlight on there. Okay. Let's go right into some of our, this is all the different
yellows that we're using and a little bit of permanent red, just let these things happen. Just mix all these colors on the brush. There it comes right down through there. See there? Just let it happen. Go into a little more sap green. All those beautiful little colors. And take your time when you're doing this. Boy, you could really make
some soft, soft, soft effects and just blend them together. Just tap. Just tap. Okay, a little more sap green. I want it a little darker
over here in this corner, so that your eye goes to the back. So now you understand why we
put all that dark under there, it makes the lighter colors stand out, otherwise you couldn't see it. It would just literally disappear. If your paint will not stick well add a little bit of paint thinner to it and then it'll stick. Little bit of paint
thinner will make it stick. So that easy, we've got all kinds of little beautiful grassy areas. Little bit of light right here, make it stand out a little more. Okay, we'll take a clean fan brush, put a little bit of white on it, and let's just go back
and sort of clean up some of these little edges. I sort of messed them up a little. There, just barely touch and pull across. Least little bit of white paint on it, like so. And, and, and. Now I'll just, we can clean
up some of these little edges. So we put a little bump there, make it a little more interesting. Then come right up through here. And I think that gives you a good idea of what you, what you can do, and it's very simple, a lot of fun, think you'll enjoy it. Tell you what, let's sign this one. We'll use a little bit of paint thinner and go right into my permanent red, load that old liner brush up with a lot of paint. I'll go right up here. And I really, really hope
you've enjoyed this one. Hope it's taught you a lot of things, made you happy, stirred your imagination. You've got your brush out now we're ready to go along. So with that I think we'll
call this painting finished. I look forward to seeing you next week and until then happy painting, God bless. (gentle music)
