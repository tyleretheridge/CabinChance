oh hey welcome back certainly glad you could join me today today I thought we'd do a fantastic little painting that's very warm and very bright is such a good day let's do a good painting so let's go up here at the canvas let me tell you what I've already done now this is probably going to look sort of green to you right in here and the reason for that is is it because I've covered this black canvas with Indian yellow right here which is a very transparent yellow but black and yellow as you know make green when we start putting color on here that'll go away right above that is a strip of alizarin crimson and then above that is a little bit of phthalo blue same thing on the bottom and I've just blended the entire canvas with a big Brush it's all ready so let's have a run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and we won't up here and get started and have some fun now first thing let's talk about for a second is how do you get the canvas black the best way that I found is get some black gesso now black gesso is made to have paint adhere to it a little better than just black house paint so I think you you'll need some of that cover the canvas and let the black dry completely you want that to be totally dry then you put these transparent colors over the black gesso and go from there don't let the don't let the transparent colors dry on you though we want to keep those nice and wet so we put and we'll put white in here I thinking let's just see what happens let's start off with the old fan brush today I'm gonna go right in to titanium white and load a lot of paint into the brush today we're going to teach you how to be a brush washer gonna get to wash the brush a whole bunch of times all right let's go right up to the canvas now you have to make a big decision right off here where's your horizon and where is the brightest spot gonna be this is gonna be like a sunset so maybe right in here right in this area here we'll have a nice bright area so you take your fan brush fully loaded with paint and do Tim get mean with it this is where you take out all your frustrations and hostilities this is better than going home and kicking the dog around look at that what's happening now see as you work upward you're picking up all that color underneath all kinds of beautiful colors in here the crimson and now you're going to get up in here where there's some blue and crimson which will make a nice lavender color okay now then wash your brush hey every time you wash your brush dry it off back into the white back into the white now when you're doing this at home try it with numerous transparent colors and I know the first question is how do I tell if the colors transparent the best way if you have a black canvas is just take a little bit of the color and put it on the canvas if it still looks black then it's transparent enough to do what we're doing here okay let's go right back up here back to the light spot paying that right in there and just begin creating some beautiful little little cloud formation let that brush dance let it play all kinds of little things are going on this is where you just sort of let your imagination go crazy all these little things just happen if you want to show a little more blue up here you could certainly do that sometimes it's pretty to have a nice stable blue up there I've mixed blue and crimson together to make it more of a lavender color but in your world you put whatever you want low just brush up again back in here always back to that the light area and work outward now let's just dance that brush by dancing it turn it spin it let all those little things just happen oh isn't it pretty right there okay now we'll wash the brush we told you you're going to be an expert brush washer by the time this one's over but you never never never want to take this dirty brush back into the light area takes a little time to do all this brush watching but it'll pay your dividends back into the light area they hand sell some of this color maybe just goes right on off the canvas and sort of wanders back right there whatever well ever just let your imagination go little more of the white now some places in here I want to show a little more distinct cloud so I'm just gonna add a little bit of white right in here so it'll be a little bit brighter a little bit brighter in places light striking and carrying on I know by now you say boy that Bob is really messed up this time you may be right there we go just let all these little things happen have fun with it now then if you was to take and try to blend all that and chances are if you blended that with a big Brush they would just make a happy mess let me show you one other thing here before we get too far along I want to make this even brighter I'm going to add some more pure white right in here look at that very bright okay now as I was saying if you tried to blend all this chances are it would smear and you'd be a mud mixer and we don't want anybody mixing so take your knife and very gently just barely touching scrape off that excess paint wipe your knife each time you scrape otherwise when you go back here you'll put a big line of of color each time wipe it off very careful because you don't want to smear this color all over the black canvas what we really have got a mess now then have it we'll take a clean dry let me repeat try two inch brush and go right up in here be sure this brush is dry and very gently very gently just start blending this mmm wearing your sunglasses today this is a bright way this is such a fantastic day and I'm in such a super nice little happy mood I thought we'd do a bright painting right paintings they make you feel good look at that look at that all these colors just come alive you'll notice on a black canvas of color sometimes looks so much stronger than it does on a white canvas and then very lightly just take out the brushstrokes okay now washing the brush I'm gonna go right back into a white here if once again now maybe in here we'll make a little cloud there's just a little bit more distinct a little bit brighter so just take a little that white and bounce it around in there maybe maybe right here wherever you think he ought to be seen that helps create the illusion of distance in your sky perspective there we go then good dry brush and then blend blend barely barely touching the canvas yes you mix it up a little bit and blend it just barely touching there we go very soft hmm now we get the rest of the painting in here this guy look near as bright as it does now right now that's a firecracker in it there we go see this this Indian yellow before it looks sort of green against the black but once you put the white with it it's opaque and that yellow just jumps right out at you hmm okay yeah we just use the same old dirty brush I'm gonna go right into some midnight black and reach over here grab a little bit of alizarin crimson to just mix these on the brush no big deal just pull the brush right through that color just pull it can't go up here now maybe there's some happy little foothills that live we back here take the brush touch just use the corner crimson and black see this is where you have to make this big decision right here a little more of the crimson in the black just drop this in wherever you think you look Foothill lives that's where he goes mmm no pretty scene that sets that sky off a lot of times if you're out selling paintings a lot of times people buy paintings per color as much as for content if you have an old doll room around your house you put this one in there you have to wear sunglasses when you go in this will brighten up with the whole room let's wash the brush it's a lot more fun to watch these big brushes it is a little videos now want to reflect some of that into the water just going to take this brush and tap it right into some titanium white just tap a little bit of color let's go up here and I decide where water and land meet back here all you do is touch and pull straight down touch and pull down so you start in the lightest area and work outward that way automatically it gets darker darker darker see there okay now back over here touch and work outward all we're doing here is just laying some color onto canvas but this too is picking up all those beautiful transparent colors that are underneath and this all happens automatically now wash the brush one more time do a scrubbing off mm-hmm and beat the delta letter now this time we're going to use a firm pressure bend that brush snap it pull it just pull it right down look at their beautiful colors now very lightly very lightly go across it and you can you can push this look see push it that way that way wherever you want to go and it creates the illusion of water bad alright let's take the knife we'll take a little bit of height touch of the bright red and I'm going to take some dark Sienna and add to that let's make a color about like it cut across it a little tiny roll of pain let's go up here now I want to put indication of a just a happy little water line here so we just let that play right in here see there just drop idea and maybe there's a few little sparklers out here on the water wherever you want now the ones that are directly directly under this bright area but had a little touch of yellow to them make him really really stand out cuz they're gonna be a little brighter a few little things like it all right yeah we can come into the foreground and play a little bit and I thank you this foreground here will have some nice big trees and bushes and what I see what happens well takes a midnight black eyes let's mix up a bunch of paint there's black and crimson shoots let's take some Van Dyck Brown's darks and we throw it all in there very dark it should look black very dark I put the color in there so when we add highlight you'll get little sparkles and you don't have to over mix this about like yet can we clean my knife off you know one thing of interest I'd like to pass them we get a lot of cards in how do I get all the paint out of a tube because when you're using a very firm paint sometimes it's a son of a gun to get all the paint out and you waste it I want to show you this this is one of the neatest little devices this is called a to bring ER in this little tube wringer all you do is just you stick you your two bread in there and crank this handle my son of a gun will take out every little bit of paint well that's a that's a lifesaver there you're to have one of those okay enough enough talking here let's load a brush we'll use it we'll use this brush and this hold two-inch brush and I'm going right into this paint pull it give it a wiggle just wiggle it that pulls the the paint down to the end of the bristles pull it give it a wiggle and then sharpen it just like you would a fine knife now this brush let me turn it seeing see look at this how sharp it is very sharp okay let's go right up here now you got to make some big decisions in your world where's the tree live I think right there all you do is touch the canvas and take just the corner of the brush now don't be afraid of this brush because it's big it will do fantastic things for you just use the corner push down and sort of work back and forth back and forth let it go are you looking for right here is a silhouette we'll come back and we'll put a few little highlights on these trees are okay now we don't want him to get lonely let's give you my little friend it lives right there all right they're just the corner of the brush look at that do you think you could make such a beautiful little tree using a big old two inch brush you can you can you can do anything and the thing at least on this piece of canvas this is your world and your creation right here do you want us to let's have another one let's have another one right there we let him really shine out here in the light he'll stand out beautifully against all that light color there he comes he lives right there in that brush just tap him out there we go hmm we got a whole family of trees now we got a mom wanna pop on a little one okay I'm bringing it back to a nice sharp edge let's go right back up here might be able to hear we have a Uncle Matt and see trees are trees are like people they have personalities everyone is different each one's an individual you know I'm a little nuts I go out in the woods at my camera take pictures of trees and I've even been known to set around and talk to trees but don't tell anybody that that's a secret people think you're crazy if you talk to trees what's worse is when they start answering you there we go there now we got a whole family of trees okay all right let's mix them let's make some more things use the same brush in the same old color and I'm going to pull it through the paint in one direction look how that brush is bending one direction one direction okay by pulling it in one direction you'll round one corner so you had surrounded on the top put that a rounded corner to the top get a score right up here now then decide where you want a happy Bush to live push and bend it in the brush you need to bend it avoid letting it slide don't let it do that see the difference bend it if it slides you're going to have a oak oh that's short for a mess okay just decide where you want little bushes to live or big bushes we'll put one right there and down in here this is already dark so you don't have to worry too much just throw in a little color can let's go over the other side here maybe there's a happy Bush that lives yep right there there we go we just got a canvas full of bushes now let's see how easy it is to just drop those in nothing to it let's put some little tree trunks in there now for that let's take some of the dark sienna pull it out very flat then cut across it so you have a little paint right on the edge at night there you can see it right there okay now that let's go right up in here I will put the indication of a little trunk just like so this tree said he wants a trunk to there you know we traveled all over the country doing demonstrations and shows for PBS stations and and other fundraising activities and that's so fantastic because I get an opportunity to to meet Oh unbelievable painters from all over the country we really enjoy it so if we get to your area I look forward to seeing you maybe we can spend some time together and talking and look at paintings and really get crazy if you would like to be notified that we're going to be in the area drop me a line and just give me your name and address I'll put you on our mailing list we have a we have a little mailing list and we send out notices and tell people are going to be in their area so if you'd like to be notified just drop me a card with your name and address on it I'll do that for you now taking a little brown-white a touch of the bright-red just a touch once again that small roll of paint now if your lights coming from here just here and there maybe a little lights just playing zipping through there okay let's go on the other side over here now here the light would hit on the opposite side it's not just yeah let's let it this was a ting through there Matt just sort of makes them stand out a little bit it makes them a little prettier okay take a 2 inch brush let's put some highlight on the hand let's put some of that dark color back on here and then go right into the bright red right into it I want a dark dark red here very dark put at least little touch of yellow ocher to that - look at that bring it brush back to a very very sharp edge sharp - okay come on back up here now then we said over here the lights coming from this direction so the left side of the tree will be the brightest don't overdo here just enough to show a little light coming through there I want to keep it quite dark quite dark there this is almost a silhouette okay yeah a little bit more right in here there it is there it is darker darker darker as it goes down in this little double treat is standing out here just shining mmm he's gonna be a pretty little son of a gun look at that hey and come right on down like so and this little tree now this one will be highlighted more on the right see their head easy drop it in there look at that I knew you could do it okay now then in here let's have some individual little bushes so I'm going to take a a one inch brush I don't dipped it into a small amount of paint thinner just a little bit then I will pull it through the color we'll use some of the red a little bit of yellow ochre shoot we can add some candy and yellow to that maybe a little more the CAD yellow one a little brighter so you can see it one direction pull it so you get that curve and the brush curve to the top okay now right up in here touch just barely touch the canvas bend it a little bit and begin forming little individual trees and bushes and all those happy little things that live in here if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little bit of paint thinner or a little bit of the liquid clear either one either one there we go happy little Bush lives right there you knew that there's a little friend and work on one Bush at a time I know sometimes it looks like I take a running start across a room and just saw kiss and eighty-eight bushes appear but they're done one at a time each one's a little individual he has his own personality just like trees don't get in too big a hurry speed will come automatically with practice first thing you want to do is learn how to do it and in the speed it just comes there's a nice little push this is still basically the yellow ocher and bright red there and just layers here say that all those little things just drop right on down I tell you what shoot that's so pretty I'm gonna take some Van Dyke Brown let's go right in here I'm gonna put a happy little cabin right here there we go there's one side the roof there's the other side and with a brown all we're doing is just blocking it in right now give him a front and the side now we can take some brown and some white and we'll put a little highlight on there barely grazing the kid this is just exactly like breaking the snow on the mountain it's a very delicate little touch now maybe over here there's a little window but you can't hardly see him outside it's very dark then we'll take a little bit of a little bit of this reddish color so it'll stand out here and just let it bounce right down this roofline just boop doop doop doop doop doop there goes there it goes make it a little brighter so you can see it down a little bit over in here now let's take a little weight and a touch of the red and let's just Sparkle this little roof see it'll really stand out see there look at that hmm jumps right out at you now some Brown will put a door in there we need a little door they will just cut in will make this whole slabs just cut in a few little indications of some boards here now and that quick gives you a happy little cabin tell you what we need a path here just like so little paths got to have a way to get to that cabin this is just Van Dyck Brown tether to the dark sienna maybe maybe maybe maybe from this guy's door out there should we just make all kinda little paths now we can take a little bit of the brown in the white barely touching barely touch and just graze it just graze it like his a little light striking there see okay yeah then back to my reds and yellow ocher let's go back up in here and we'll put some happy little bushes right there's one that lives back behind the cabin and this one right here now this one let's just have it sort of fall right over the path that'll push it back look at that see there see it's fantastic the way you can just drop these in there we go this one is in front of the cabin so just let it push it back even further right down by the path look at there see and here I'm using the brush sideways and just pushing up or just bend that brush it's unbelievable what you can do now let's just take a clean point of the knife it's great been a few little sticks and little twigs here and there that helps create depth that's how I'm coming over I think we're about ready to sign that one take a little liquid clear a little bright red will sign this one I hope you've enjoyed it this one there's a lot of fun so from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless we'll see you next time you
