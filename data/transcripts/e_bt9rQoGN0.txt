ha-hey certainly glad you could join me today thought today we do just a fantastic little painting and I think you'll enjoy this one so let's start out having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that let me show you what I've done up here I have my standard ole 18 by 24 inch canvas but you you use whatever size you want and today I've cut out an oval out of just contact paper and stuck on there but what's different inside of this oval I've covered the center of this with liquid clear right in here and then on the top and the bottom I've put liquid white and just let them blend together today we're going to something it's a little different and I want I want this to stay very transparent in here that's the reason we have the clear in here and when you apply this clear apply very very little I can't say that enough shoot one one can of that'll last you probably the rest to your life it takes very little biggest mistake made is applying too much so let's just have some fun - I'm gonna start off with a little little touch of the phthalo blue today on the two-inch brush just take a little out tap the bristles firmly into the paint that assures we have a nice even distribution of color all the way through the bristles tanks go up here now then let's just lay in a happy little sky just making little crisscross strokes start at the top and work down word and by working downward that's going to mix with the liquid white and automatically automatically it's going to get lighter and lighter in value as it travels downward and that's exactly what we're looking for let it work by itself you don't you don't have to worry about it here let it happen okay they will have a little water in here you know me I love water so maybe down here on the bottom will just come right across like so there same color just a little blue and come from the other side I'm trying to leave a little air you open here and if everything works just right when we're all finished that'll look like a little sheen of light coming across the water and that too will happen automatically for you there maybe we'll put some buildings today that are sitting setting out here on the edge of the water I live in Florida which I think I've mentioned several times and close to where our lives the st. Johns River and there's a lot of beautiful beautiful buildings that set right on the river and some of the best fishing in the country why it's nice okay I'll wash the old brush we just wash it with odorless thinner give it a good shake and just beat the devil out of it very lightly now very lightly we just blend all this water area right together there let's see that light area remains in there it's your good friend okay tell you what let's take a little black a little Prussian blue we'll put a happy little cloud up here very very little paint on the brush though very little paint and mostly black okay let's go ahead up here maybe in our world up here in the sky we'll put in some just little clouds using just the corner of the brush that's all we're using there see just make little little round circles maybe there's a happy little cloud that ap floats right out here I don't know wherever you want wherever you want into your world you make this big decision and decide where these little rascals live and just drop them in that easy there now then yeah then let me grab a fan brush here we'll take old fan brush a little touch of the titanium white on it fact there's more than a touch there's a lot of paint on that brush just really load it up now then let's go up in here now make some big decisions maybe there's some highlights on these clouds take just use the corner of the fan brush make a little tiny circular little circular strokes Wow that colored is just sort of blend back there see just very gentle little clouds maybe the little light playing right through there on that edge whoever wherever little bit here and each painting will be different and individual we don't use any patterns we don't do any tracing here this is a very free form of painting very very free that your imagination work for you each of us has issued an imagination when we're born use it and it's like any other muscle or anything in our body the more you use it the better it works get strong just like if you exercise your arm get strong big use your imagination there it may be the most valuable asset that any artist can have there we are it's very easy to learn to paint very easy she will teach you to paint right here and very rapidly the problem does not end up being what to paint or how to paint I'm sorry but what to paint yeah what to paint becomes much more difficult than how to paint put another little layer in that sometimes my tongue gets over my teeth and I can't see what I'm saying there just blend that right help there we go like click we have just a very nice little sky very simple little sky but very effective thought they would use the old round brush what the heck let's just take loo take some black just going to mix color on the brush black sand a little SAP green be right back get a little brown a little lizard crimson whatever look a touch of the Prussian blue just tap firmly firmly tap take let's go right up here dad it may be in our world there lives some happy little trees back here so we'll take this brush and just tap in some very basic little shapes this brush is fantastic for making the distant tree shapes leafy foliage air things it just works so well there we are little background trees and this is just the dark so we can come back and add a little bit of light and I'll show you put dark against dark you have nothing absolutely nothing doesn't show if you put a light against light you have nothing now I want to create the illusion of a little mist down here so I'm going to take a large brush and just tap the base of this just to soften that's what's soften everything this is where you take out all your frustrations and hostilities and everything this is better than going home and arguing with your spouse or kicking the puppy dog around do it here doesn't hurt anybody makes you feel good when you're all done instead of being angry you have a beautiful painting up here so it works for everybody now then take a little paint thinner we'll find a little dark sienna and a little white mix them together there we let me reach right over here and get a little more paint thinner a little more I want this to be very thin there we go see how thin that is I almost runs right off the pallet and we can go up in here and put the indication here and there just a little tree trunk saying there and put as few or as many as you want it's up to you maybe there's a couple of old sticks and twigs that stick out here maybe there was a tree there one timing and he passed away okay now let me grab another round brush I have a couple of them going here going to dip it into a little touch little touch of the liquid white only too thin color and I'm going to start tapping it right into some yellows yellow ocher little Indian yellow all those nice colors here and there little bright red whatever be right back and give a little SAP green too but just tap it to load the bristles see all you have to do it's very simple works well now then we go up here and go slightly above the dark just tap in all kinds of nice little highlights just tap them in there this brush works so well it makes such nice effects so very easy think about shape and form make little individual things all in your little trees don't just hit it random there's another one change the color a little bit I'm just sort of varying back and forth between all the yellows and whatever and dannielle a little bright red here and there just to sparkle it up there we go maybe little touch right in there this sort of gives a layered effect makes it look like the bushes are deep which a lot of trees a lot of little things happen something like so this is just background material we're not really concerned about it strictly strictly background material we're going to cover up a lot of it anyway you can take a clean knife scrape down the indication here a little sticks and twigs trunks little places for the squirrels to run up and down there my little squirrel still lives with me he lives in squirrel Hilton we built him a great big cage he's almost ready to turn loose now son of a guns ready to make it on his own okay let's start out here with some Van Dyke Brown pull it out very flat very flat get tough with it cut across and get our small rule of paint right on the edge of the knife now maybe there's a wall back here maybe this is a sea wall touch and pull down now we're into the we're into the liquid clear now just touch it and pull it down now because that liquid clear is in there it does not distort color liquid white would distort your color and make it lighter I don't want this to be distorted and we'll grab the base of it with a large brush and pull down and you've probably guessed already this is going to be the reflection very lightly go across and just do like that it's instant reflections now I want to make this look like board standing up here so we'll take let's take the knife and instead of adding paint today we're going to take paint away see just push you can probably hear how hard I'm pushing and you make all different sizes of little boards big ones small ones whatever you want okay this is a subtractive process rather than adding paint we're taking pain away and it's very effective works very nice maybe in our world let's have a building let's come right in here maybe let's just sort of scrape out a basic shape maybe there's an old building lives right there I scrape out this shape only to remove this excess paint so our color will remain nice and nice and firm good color when we put it on here let's take start up here a little bit of Van Dyck Brown just give us a basic roof light like so now let's take dark sienna put a touch of alizarin crimson and Van Dyck Brown to that to our little roll of paint once again there it is now then all we're going to do don't worry about it here just very firmly apply this paint just all you're doing is blocking in don't worry about it don't get concerned anything it matters is a roof line and straight edges on the side we don't care about anything else at this point later on we'll begin worrying about details but right now just just block in a very basic little shape we'll take our large brush again grab it and pull down pull down and once again you're right just reflections go across and see how much different this is where the liquid clear there beautiful effects now then take the knife now very firmly very firmly here all we're doing is once again we're just removing paint just removing paint now then maybe let's make some boards in here and by tilting the knife I'm stood over here you can see tilting it this way or that way you can make it brighter on one side and dollar on the other try this it'll make sense I know it sorta see it has a light side and a dark side look at their you know how long it take you to paint that many boards a couple of minutes but all you doing is removing paint and if these have been out here on this river or whatever it is for a long time they're gonna be weather-beaten all banged up and everything so don't worry about having a real smooth and real nice it really adds to it if they if they have a character shoot anybody can do a new smooth building maybe there's a right in here maybe there's a door shoot to nose go up here maybe there's a window there might be over here by the window however Minnie won't shoot yo nothin there's one wherever you wanna just put them in now we can just take our little knife I use a little knife because it really bends better maybe there's something across like yet all we're doing still though is removing paint while we're doing is allowing the canvas to show through it's all tell you what maybe here maybe there's a walkway so we'll first put it in all we're doing scraping off paint once again sometimes it'll help take a little black and put a very dark line under it that way it'll stand out yeah then since this is water I'll take some white little bit of liquid white liquid whites-only to thin a little touch of blue in it leaves little touch cut us off a tiny little bit okay now let's go up here and just very firmly very firmly I didn't a little bit a little water line here and there and you just really scraping it in you need to put this in and I'll show you by before we do the next step because we always do the thing is first away and work forward and I'm going to take a little bit of black just plate in black and maybe there's some little posts that go down in the water that hold up this little walkway see there all there is to it I'm just touching the canvas and we'll grab that pull that down go across and reflect her little post right into the water now these reflections you can move them we'll see you can make them wiggle cause it's wet the liquid clears under there there we go and back to our liquid white with a little blue in it a little water out here but see you wanted that water behind that's the reason we did that one back here first a few little things here and there shoot guide me you can also take the knife just use a small edge and scrape out a little bit along these post to make a highlight just sort of cut it in there are you doing is removing paint so I say this is a subtractive process rather than and usually we're adding paint today we're subtracting paint let's get crazy let's get crazy let's come right up in here let's take some black and some Van Dyke Brown mostly black though mostly black let's come right in here maybe there's a big building it's right here we'll do the roof all we're doing right now is just locking in color just like we did before there's a roof and come right down look at there there it comes there it is all right I'll do we're just filling us all in very dark color black with a little bit of brown but mostly black mostly black maybe there's a projection attic I don't know just sort of make up some buildings Heke don't have to be just like something you've saw make him up if an architect us and I had made it up to begin with he wouldn't be there so you can do that on canvas you can be an architect on canvas you can create anything that you want to create and we'll have it color here we don't need a little underneath or once again to create a reflection if you ever do a painting it's on water and you forget to reflection it'll look like it's floating above the water and sometimes you don't even notice it you just sort of forget if you ever do a painting it looks like your object here is floating check to make sure that you have a reflection under it because if you don't that will happen now then once again we're going to use a subtractive process and we'll take the small knife a little little edge on it and just sort of randomly pick off little spots if this works just right it looks like little stones maybe this is little buildings made out of stones and just sort of don't kill all the dark just take the knife and pick them off this is one of the easiest most effective ways I've ever designed to create an effective little stone buildings see there it's very very simple very simple you'll love it promise sounds like a used car sales and trust me trust me I can take a little dark CNN and bright red and mix it together here there we are put out flat cut across our little roll of paint once again and maybe up in here maybe there's an old red roof just sort of let it come right on down add a little white to them it's not bright enough I want you to be able to see a little bit all right all right they're beautiful that works better see now you can see it a little better but there is our roof now maybe in our building here get a little black maybe there's a window come right up here with a camera to see right up here there's a window that lives right there just come across it's all there is to it maybe he's got a friend another window right there I don't know wherever you want the same thing take a small knife here and just sort of scrape around this window to create a highlight excuse mahram for just second so I can go down there and that easy it sort of outlines the little window and you've created the highlight around the window that's easy maybe shoot maybe there's a a walkway there would take some black a little roll of paint let's come right in here see here comes a little walkway and it projects out past that and then goes back now that clean my knife we can turn once again scrape off a highlight on top just firmly firmly scrape and then we need a top real watch here maybe the top rail there's enough dark paint on there you almost don't even have to ahead anymore just scrape it those are real and I'm bouncing back and forth between the little knife and the large and I have depending on the size we need but some little doers in there and once again you can just scrape those give a little highlight and easy maybe right along here to separate this ledge will just great a little pain off to create a little highlight right there see but that easy this looks it looks like an old stone building setting out here so million and a half years old at least a decade or two in that fantastic oh I love these kind of little paintings and you'll find they work for you a little water line right into here so I say on the st. Johns River in Florida there's a lot of buildings and stuff that set right on the river like this and it's spectacular I like to set up on some of these old walls and stuff catch a big bass it lives out there that dinner as I mentioned before there I bring him in put a bandaid on his mouth came a little CPR turning loose that's coming up here take the contact paper off see what we have here and we are that easy we have beautiful little thing now you know me I always have to put a big tree of everything sometimes I get letters from people they say ones yet but the big tree in there I liked it better before you put it in there if that's the case leave a big tree out we only want to show you how to do things here we're not we're not trying to tell you this is the way to do it or the only way to do it the right way wrong way and heart I don't believe there is a right or wrong way you do what makes you happy Art's too free to be confined by distinct rules it's an individual thing so I want a big tree here anyway there it goes and all I'm doing is I'm just using no to integration just putting in a basic shape just very basic I'm not worried about detail just a big old basic sheet areas there maybe we need a little reflection right into here take a clean brush and just pull that straight down and go across that easy we got a nice reflection and let's have this maybe come there it is yeah and it come right on out here wherever you want that's just where it should be and take a fan brush we'll put a little white little dark CNN on it yeah okay let's go right up in here and here's our old tree trunks mmm there he is just dropping Meridian we'll go back to our round brush a little bit of color and let's highlight this think about four think about shape sounds like a song doesn't it that's maybe a good way to remember it if I could sing that sing it to you think about think shape build a tree there like a data then fantastic it's all round brush does wonderful things you can paint entire paintings with it entire painting and it's not really round it's sort of a oval shape so you can you can bring it to a nice short chisel edge if you want beautiful evergreens all kinds of things clouds whatever try there we go now maybe back in here maybe there's some little individual bushes just figure out where they're at drop them and change the colors a little wherever see yeah there they are okay and in your world you make the big decisions where all these little things live and drop them in now then let me come right along here take a little bit of the liquid white put a little water line right in there the old clock tells me it's about time to leave you for the day so I'm going to leave you putting in take a little brown little white put it in a landmass right here look at that and we can take where you can take our fan brush pop in some nice little items just like so hearing there isn't that something I hope you try this one because I know that you'll enjoy it it's a fantastic way to paint from all of us here happy painting and God bless you
