- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad to see you today. I thought today we'd do something that's a little bit different, so let's start out and
have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you this crazy thing I've
got going up here today. I'm back to my good ol' black gesso. I love that black gesso. Take in a regular 18 by 24 inch canvas or any size that you want and I've just taken a paper
towel with black gesso and just sort of daubed all over like that and just sort
of put a design in here. And I know it looks like
a bomb went off in there, but hopefully it'll look
better before it's over with. Allow the black gesso to dry completely. Now, all of it that has the black gesso and that I've covered with
a thin coat of liquid clear. And over that, I've put a
mixture of Van Dyke brown, sap green, and a little
bit of Prussian blue. Not much blue. And up here it just has liquid white. And when you called me
I was just finishing up with a little bit of this dark color that goes right over the black gesso. And all you need is
just a thin, even coat. The reason we put the
liquid clear on there first is because that way, you
can put a very thin coat, it's almost like a glaze, over the black. If you just try to put
solid color on there, you're gonna put so much paint that when you put a little white on there, it just, it's almost too bright. So this allows you to do
very gentle little things. All right, now to just keeping using that same old dirty brush
and go into small amount. Let's use a little tiny
bit of phthalo blue. Not much, but right on that dirty brush. So I'm just gonna mix
it with that same color that's on the bottom of the canvas. Don't need much. And let's go right up here in the sky and see what we have. There. Juts little color. Something like it. So we have phthalo blue
with the same colors that we have on the bottom here. And we just sort of let it blend together. About like that. We'll come back with a clean brush and blend that a little more. But the color's transparent enough that the black gesso things come through and it'll give that illusion of a lot of little things
happening in the background without you hardly doing a thing. There. This black gesso may be
one of the neatest things that I've ever invented. I really hope you like it. It has just about become a
standard now in the art world. It was, as they say, you
saw it first right here on The Joy of Painting. All right. We'll just bring that right on down. Now, let's have some fun. And I'm gonna take a clean brush. And I have several of each one going, so I don't have to spend all of my time just washing brushes. Just wanna blend this out
till it's nice and soft. And all it's doing is mixing
with the liquid white, just on the canvas, and blending. And you can blend this
to any degree of softness that you want. That's about all we need right now. There. The only thing that I'm really
sure of in this painting is that I'm gonna have a big mass of trees right here in this very dark area. Other than that, I don't really care. You really don't have to
make a lot of decisions with this, you just have a general idea of what you want and you
need to know the time of year and the time of day for
light and of course, if you're doing a winter scene, you want it to look a little cold, summer scene, vice versa, whatever. Without cleaning that brush,
I'm gonna go right into a small amount of the dark sienna. So I still have all that
bottom color and the sky color and I just added dark
sienna right onto it. And let's go up in here and just begin picking out some little background things. I don't want a lot of detail because it's too far away. There. Just a few little things that are way back in the distance there. There. Sometimes it's sort of
nice to take your brush and put it up here and
just bend it sidewards. And it'll make the
indication of little trees that have little arms sticking out. But that easy. Maybe there's another one there, wherever you think they should be. And all you're doin' is
just bendin' the brush. Gonna give him a little
friend right in there. However many you want. It's up to you. Now, I don't wanna cover
up all those little things made by the black gesso
that are showing through 'cause to me, those are very
attractive, very pretty. There. Want it to be very soft
and extremely misty. You can add a little
titanium white to your brush once in a while. Very, very little. Smallest amount. Smallest amount and it'll look just like mist laying back here. There. Something like so. Then we can find a few more dark bushes right in the foreground. Right over the top of the mist. And that mist will act as a separator. It'll keep 'em apart. There we go. And there's not a great
deal of paint on here. There really and truly is
a lot of different colors, but there's not a great deal of paint. If you was to scrape that very hard, you'd get very little off of it. Okay, back to our dark
sienna, let's go near the side and do a little bit over in here too. We don't want this one left out. Maybe over here there's one
of those sidewards trees. I don't want them to be very distinct. If they're real distinct, you'll lose that illusion of distance. We'll do things that are very
distinct in the foreground. Back here, we only want suggestions. There. Once again, maybe the least
little touch of that titanium to create a misty area. And back to some of our darker colors. There we go, just tap in an indication of some little distant bushes
and things that are happening. Now, let's go, let me find a knife here. We can mix up some color. Let's take some black,
a little Prussian blue, some Van Dyke brown, a little sap green. Same basic colors that we had before. All right, let me wipe off the ol' knife. But the predominant color here is black. Most of it is black. We put the other ones in there just to flavor it a little bit. I'm gonna just load
the brush by tapping it right into the color. Just tap it. Let's go right up in here. Have to make some big decisions. Using just the corner of the brush. Now let's begin just laying in all kinds of very basic little patterns. This is gonna be a big clump
of trees back here, I think. That's all. We'll start laying in some
very basic little shapes. And because we have that
black gesso in there, we have to do very little, very, very little in the
way of putting in our darks. They're already there. In fact, the worst thing you
can do is cover all that up. All those little light areas in there will look like light come
right through the tree. That's the reason I put
that on with a paper towel rather than a brush. If you put it on with a brush,
you just have solid color and I'm really looking for
these little light areas. It'll drive people crazy if you
don't know how you did that. Shh, that's our secret,
don't you tell 'em. Just between you and I. There we go. Down in here I want that to be quite dark. Like so. Why it'd be a fantastic place for one of my little critters to live. In the last show, I showed
you Steve being introduced to one of my little squirrels. Now, Steve had never
played with a squirrel. I'm gonna show you him
again while I'm doing this. I'm just gonna be putting in
some of this little dark area. And we'll show you, this is in my backyard in Florida. And Steve finally got enough nerve up to let the little squirrel jump on him. But isn't he the cutest little devil? I mean the squirrel. (laughs) Steve's a little big to be cute. When this was made,
Steve was, what's Steve? 24 now, he's 24. A little short guy, he's six foot five. He calls me shorty. Now then, let's take our liner brush, go into some paint thinner. Take a little brown, grab
a little white there too. There, nice color. A little brown, a little white. Van Dyke, dark sienna, both mixed in here. Hope you enjoy seeing
those little critters. Okay, just pull that to a nice point and let's go back in here and here and there and there and here. Let's put the indication
of a few little limbs, sticks, trunks, twigs. Whatever that live back in here. I don't want 'em to be real distinct, but enough that they stand out. There. Maybe add a little more white to this one. There we go. A little more paint thinner. Let's have a nice one, yep. That's right. There. And let your hand wiggle and jiggle and make all those little crazy things. I have people write and they
tell me they can't paint because their hand shakes a little. Shoot, you have an advantage. Use it. There's no reason that one can't paint. No reason. I have one lady who paints with
us, lives in the Boston area and she's totally blind and she paints along with us. Just from listening. That's one fantastic lady. Takes a lot of nerve to do that. And she does it very well,
I've seen some of her paintings and you wouldn't believe what she's doing. Would not believe. So if she can do that, the rest
of us don't have any excuse. There. This one's got a little more
brown and it doesn't matter. I just happen to hit a little more. However you want 'em. There. Now then. Let's take, well, this brush didn't
have too much on it. We'll just use it. Let's have a little bit
of the yellow ochre. Be right back, I'm gonna
get a little dark sienna. Put in maybe a little more. There. Cad yellow, yellow ochre. We'll use some Indian yellow for it, so, and even some of the bright red. Just load a little bit
of color, just push, so you can see how that's, see that little ridge right there? There's one just like it on the bristles and that's what we're gonna use. And we can come in here and very lightly, I don't want a lot of color back here. Oh, that's perfect. That is perfect. Just a little, just a little. Don't overkill. Want just enough to make
it stand out a little. Want this to be a very
subdued, quiet painting back here at the back. Little bit more of the
dark sienna, yellow ochre, little Indian yellow in there. There. See that, how that works? But I'm using just the
corner of the brush, I'm not using the entire brush. And this will work with a one inch brush, with either one of the round brushes. The oval brush, the one inch oval brush will do it just as good. Just whatever your preference is. Practice a little bit with all of 'em and find the one that
works the best for you. And then that's the
right brush for the job. There. There we go, there we go. I love to do little paintings like this, especially with this black gesso. It just makes it so easy. So easy. There. But you've already got a
whole clump of trees there. That easy. All right. Now maybe, maybe, let's see, I'm gonna add the least little touch of the bright red to that, we need a little sparkler in there. A little sparkler, but I
don't want it too bright. Maybe even then go into
the least little touch of the titanium white and
I'm gonna come right in here. Oh, there's a beautiful little bush. He lives right along in here. Just pick him out, there he is. There he is. Darker, darker, darker,
down toward the base. Down toward the bottom, don't
let him get too bright on you. There. Highlight him with a little touch of the yellow ochre just to change its flavor a little. I see another one right there. See these little things that
you just drop in at random all of a sudden begin, they look like little
things back in there. If you're not too concerned
when you first start, then just sort of let 'em go wherever. But then as you begin painting, all these little things
that were happy accidents turn into beautiful little things. Don't fight 'em. Learn to enjoy 'em. Let 'em happen. Well, I'll tell you what. How 'bout, let's do this. Maybe, yup, you're right. Look here. Maybe there's a nice little grassy area that lives right along in there. What a gorgeous place to
have a little grassy area. Back underneath all these beautiful trees. There. 'Kay. And just think about the way
you want the land to go here. Wow, that got a little brighter. See, that'll look like
a whole different plane. Just by making it a little brighter. Hid a little bit more of the
yellow ochre in that one. Just sort of vary your
colors back and forth. Shoot. It's unreal what you can do. Absolutely unreal. Let me get my liner brush here. Have a little bit of brown on it. Just a little bit of the Van
Dyke, not much, just a little. I want to put a few little
sticks and twigs back here too. Need a little more thinner. If it didn't go real easy, real smooth, add a little thinner. There we go. Some of them very light,
can hardly see 'em. Other ones a little darker. All right, all right. A few over in here. Okay, touch more of the color. But just wherever you want 'em. Now, I see something. I see something. Let me find a fan brush. There. Dip that into a little
bit of the liquid white and then go into titanium white. And I'll be right back, I'm
gonna get the least little touch of phthalo blue and put in
the least, tiny little bit. So strong. So strong, I see something here. it's just, I have to do this. Watch here. I have to do this, watch, watch. Over, choo. It's just a perfect place
for a little waterfall to just sneak out from behind there, come crashing down. And it splashes right along in there. See it, see it? There it is. And it just sorta starts from there. It begins working out. Begins working out. Again, I see all kind of things. Now, watch, watch, watch. Look, pull down. Straight down and it's
gonna pick up that color that's underneath. Here it comes. Now, go across. Back to our fan brush
that has that color on it. And very lightly, just
grazing the surface. Just make the water slick and shiny. That easy. There. Isn't that fantastic? You can do that, that easy. That easy. Now, we need a little something over here to contain it. Because we have that
black gesso underneath, we don't even have to
put anything on there. It'll just go right in. Bright it up with a little touch of yellow so you can see it a little better. There we go. Now it shows up. Now, watch. Okay, let's take, I'm
gonna use a little black and Van Dyke brown mixed together. I need to mix up, I wanna take some liquid white and put it right out here. Just a little bit of the liquid white. And to that I'll mix some dark sienna and Van Dyke brown. I wanna make a very thin brown color. All right. Okay, let me wash off the old knife there. We pull this brush through black and brown and then the half of it
through that thin color we made and let's have, right in here. Yeah, just a bunch of little stones. Just a bunch of little
stones live right in there. There they are. But you can make both sides
of the stone in one stroke just by doing that. There. And, of course, the water's gotta, choo,
sneak right over there. Choo. Gotta make those little noises. Just doesn't work without
those little noises. And back to another brush and let's pull this down. I'll tell you what, maybe this
comes on right around here, I don't know. Where do you want it to go? In your world, you decide. Maybe it comes right and around and just mix in with the
color that's on the canvas and automatically you get
all these beautiful shades and hues. Just very lightly go across. We have instant reflections there. And I don't want this to be too bright. I want it to stay sort of subdued in this particular little painting. I feel it would be quite dark. Just let it just sort
of skim across there. All right. Now then, let's finish up some little
grassy areas right in. Just sort of let 'em flow back here. Farther, farther back. Wherever you want 'em. Here and there I'm gonna
touch the least little bit with the titanium white, so it looks like there's a little light
zinging through there, but not much. Not much, if you use much, it'll ruin the illusion. Too much. There. See there, though, how you can
make all those little hills? There we go. Mmkay. But once again, there's
not a great deal of paint on the canvas. Because you have a black gesso on there. That dark color's already in, so you don't have to
apply very much paint. It takes very little
color to actually do this. Very little color. And maybe, let's really get crazy here. Let's just cut off our little stream. It comes right across here. Gotta have something to contain it. There it is. Mmkay. Now then. Let's take a brush that's got a little of that dark color on it. Maybe right in here, tap
in a few little things. I'll have a little tree right there. Just a little tree. Give him a little trunk. Just some brown and
white on the liner brush. There we go. Just brown and white
then with paint thinner. A few little arms here and there. We can come back. Put a little highlight
on there, just a little. All right. So now we have a little
tree that lives right there. Right about there. Let's get crazy. You know me, you know me. Let's take some Van Dyke
brown, a little black. A little black, a little crimson. Put a little crimson in there too, yeah. In my world, here goes our
beautiful trees back here. (imitates whizzing) Be brave. This is your bravery test. We'll just have us a big
tree that lives right there. We'll give him a friend, choo. Have two big trees. Just drop those rascals right in there. There, and maybe they sit
out here on a big rock. Big ol' rock that lives here
on the edge of the water. Maybe it's all been
washed away except that. And we take a little white,
a little dark sienna, a little touch of the Van Dyke. Get us a small roll of paint and then just touch, just graze. (staccato airy whistling notes) Something like that, just let it graze. Work right down again. Allowing the paint to break, no pressure. Absolutely no pressure. A little Prussian blue and white. And on the one side here
we can put a little blue, mix a little reflected light on there. Let's have some fun here. We got a minute or so left. We can take my filbert brush and turn this into great big stones that are
all around the edge of this. There we are. Just, here they go. (imitates plopping stones) However many you want, however many you want. There, see how you can just give the illusion that
there's all kind of stones and rocks down here at the base of this couple of old trees? It's all you have to do. Take your fan brush, a little bit of that thin paint on it. Clean up the edges. Looks like a little water
lines around the bottom. There. Something like so. Man. Let's go up here and put some
stuff on the big ol' tree. Let's put a few little
limbs on the bottom, then on the top, shoot, we'll just put in some nice leaves. Gotta have a few little
limbs down here, though. Here's an old limb that comes off and goes every which wiggledy way. Like that. Maybe just one on this one. And you can take a little bit
of that thin brown and white. Actually, you could double
load this little brush and do this all in one stroke. However, however. Put a few little things here
and there and there and here. And here's one that comes out. Maybe it comes around in front. Another one here, another one there. There. On the top, maybe those limbs, maybe they still have some leaves on 'em, so we'll take a little dark paint here on the ol' two-inch brush and just put the indication of some nice foliage that lives right up here. Oh, there goes my beautiful tree I worked so hard on in the background. But we know it's there, no big deal. We know it's there. There. You know, if you have time, I love to look at photographs of paintings that people have done
from watching this show. So if you have time, drop us a line, we'd love to hear from you and we'd love to see the paintings and as time permits, every so often we put 'em together in a little board and we like to show 'em to you. So, drop us a line, let
us see what you're doing and let us hear about the successes that are going on in your life. There, a little touch of paint thinner. Wanna thin down, use that same dirty brush and go into a little bright red. That'll make a very dirty red color. Very dull. All right. Maybe we'll highlight the tree with that. Ooh, I like that. That's not very bright. That's just enough so it shows up against the trees
that are in the background. Just a little, right in there. But think about the shape, don't just hit at random. I like it. I like paintings that aren't real bright. But they're a little harder to do than paintings that are extremely bright. Now, when you're doing yours at home, you do it in any color that you want. Any color that you want,
'cause this'll work if you done it in bright
greens or whatever. It really doesn't matter. It's an individual thing. There. Once in a while I just
like to use these colors that are a lot more muted. All right. Something about (mumbles). And shoot, we can take
the old liner brush, put a few little sticks here
and there and there and here. We're about to the point of
having a finished painting. You could take a little touch
of the blue and the white, make that shadow come right on down to really make it interesting. Right across the rocks. And I think with that, we'll
call that a finished painting. I hope you've enjoyed it. Try the black gesso and let
me know how it works for you. From all of us here, happy painting and God bless, my friend. (relaxing music)
