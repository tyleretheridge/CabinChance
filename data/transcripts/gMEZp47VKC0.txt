- Hey, welcome back! Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today we'd do a painting that just has a lot of color in it. One that'll make you feel good inside. So, let's start out and
have them run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me tell you what
I've got done up here. Have my standard 18 by
24-inch double-primed, pre-stretched canvas. But you use any size that you want. And I just covered the entire canvas with a very thin, even
coat of liquid white. So, the canvas is all wet, and we can, literally,
blend color up there. Let's do it. Let's start with our little,
tiny two-inch brush, today. (chuckles) I'll go right
into a small amount of the Indian yellow. Just a very small amount. We'll go right up here in the sky and just do something like that. That's all there is to it. Just make little criss-cross strokes. Something like that. OK, now, without cleaning the brush, I'll go right into a
little bit of yellow ochre. Just right into it, don't
even have to clean the brush. Little yellow ochre, it's
sort of a golden color. There. Once again, without cleaning the brush, a little touch of the bright red. Be careful with the bright red. It's a gorgeous, gorgeous color, but it is so strong. Whew! One tube would turn the
whole Atlantic Ocean red. Be very careful with it. Don't need much. There we go. We just sort of blend
that around like that. There. That's pretty already. Shoot, I like that. Now, then, for the rest of the sky-- Tell you what, let's do the rest of the sky in a lavender color. We'll just brush mix it here. I'll use a little phthalo blue, alizarin crimson. Proportionately much
more crimson than blue, 'cause crimson's a weak
color compared to the blue. All right! Let's go up in here. Now, then, I just want to sort of dance this around a little bit. Just let it play and bounce. Here and there, and there and here. There, just where ever. Where ever. Sometimes it goes to the red side, sometimes to the blue, It doesn't matter. There we are. Gorgeous colors. Now, then, maybe I'll
touch a little phthalo blue and just hit it here and there, up toward the top. Don't what that blue against the green or the yellow here, or we'll get green. Then we'll wash the brush. That's the most fun part
of this whole procedure. Shake it off. (chuckles) Just beat the devil out of it. Now then, clean, dry brush. Let's begin blending
these colors together. Just blend them together. There! Because the liquid white's under there, you can literally move and blend color. That's exactly what we're doing. (brush slaps on stand) I've just beaten the
brush to remove any paint that I've picked up, without going through the whole cleaning procedure. In layman terms, that's called "laziness." There! Just didn't want to bother
cleaning the whole brush. Maybe something about, like that. Now, then, today, let's put
some clouds up here in the sky. We're gonna have a sky that's
just gorgeous, shiny, bright. Lot of color in it. (brush slaps stand) There we go. I usually wipe the old
brush against a paper towel, to be sure I've got all the
excess paint removed off of it. Let's have a big cloud. For that, I gonna go
into the titanium white. I'll be right back. Don't go away. There. Put a little bright red with it. Shoot, let's make a
firecracker, a sparkler. Go up in here. Maybe in our world there
lives a big old cloud right up in here. He just sort of floats around,
has a good time all day. You know, clouds are one
of the freeist things in nature, I believe. So, just let him go. Shoot, let them have fun. Let them have fun, where
ever you want them. Let them go. There. Maybe, I don't know, just
decide where these clouds live in your world, and put them in. Put them in. And don't just try to copy
what we're doing here. Shoot! This is a very
freestyle of painting. We don't use any patterns. We don't trace anything. We just let it happen. That really is the beauty of all this. We'll just pull a little bit down in here. But notice, I'm not covering
up all this nice yellow color. I want some of it to
show through the cloud. There. Maybe over in here there's
some more, whatever. Whatever. Now, today, I want to get our
little, soft blender brush. Very gentle, soft little brush. Just blend the base of
that out a little bit. Gentle, gentle, gentle. Barely touching. Just caress the canvas a little. There we go. Something about like that. And you can fluff it a little bit. Blend it. There. Little old cloud. Shoot, this is a big old cloud. This just setting right
up there in the sky. Now then, we can take-- I'll just use the blender, 'cause this blender's sort of unique. You can paint with it. I'm gonna put the least little touch of that bright red on there. Little bit of white with it. Just begin putting in all kinds of gorgeous little things
that just float around. There they go. There they go. Reach over here and get a touch of that lavendery color we were using. Just the least little touch. There. See, this blender's so soft, you can just get in here and work all this color without at all blending together. Course, if you blend it long enough, it will just blend together. But you can put all these things in there just by doing that. Maybe there's one... Go back to my pinks every once in awhile. It's up to you. Up to you, where ever
you think it should be. There we go. See all kinds of little things. Least little touch of
the phthalo blue, maybe. Ooh, that's nice! Be careful that you don't
hit that yellow, though. Or we'll have a brilliant green sky, and we're not looking for that. Not in this particular painting, maybe sometimes, but not now. Not now. There's a nice little
cloud, floating right there. All right! Little bit of bright red and white again. Maybe up here in our sky, let's just put, while we have this old
brush working so well, let's just put the indication
of some little floaters around in here. Just enough to break it up. See, just little floaters. There, something like that. Wherever, wherever. You make the decision. But isn't that brush fantastic
for doing things like that? Or you can paint right
over that firm paint that we already have up there. Maybe over in here we got a little more. Very soft, gentle, quiet. There, all right. I get carried away sometimes. OK. Now, maybe, I'll tell you what. Maybe in our world, maybe,
maybe, maybe, maybe. Let me grab a fan brush. There's one. Let's take a little bit
of that lavender color that was just phthalo
blue, alizarin crimson, right on the fan brush here. Maybe, let's go up in here. All right, let's do this. Let's put a nice dark cloud in here. That contrast will sparkle. It will absolutely sparkle. There. Maybe we'll put a wild shape on this one. There we go. Got a little bump that lives right there. When I was a kid, I used to sit around. My brother and I, we'd look at clouds. We'd pick out all kind of shapes. We'd see the mean, old witch or the candy man, or whatever. They all lived in the clouds. You can see all kinds of shapes in there, if you just spend a
little time and study it, and you got a good imagination. All kinds of things. Back to my little blender. Now then, just softly,
softly blend this a little. Don't have to do it much. And you can just bring it all together. Looks like that old
cloud just sort of floats right around the corner there. Just like that. There we go. All right! Come right on out like that. Shoot, maybe there's some nice
things happening down here. Just take that color that
you picked up and use it. Let these things happen. Let them happen. Very lightly, that's
where the blender brush really works well. Sometimes, you can take a little of that bright red and white, and you can put a few
little highlights up here, just to dull everything down so it's not quite as distinct. Few little areas right
along in here somewhere. So you can make out a
little detail in this cloud. Don't want much, though. Don't want to lose that gorgeous darkness. It really works in this painting. I like that darkness. There. Something about like that. Now, sometimes, let's take
some pure titanium white. Maybe in our world the sun lives right behind that big cloud, there. So we can just take pure titanium white-- I'm just gonna use the knife. You could take your finger or you could take a brush. But I want to push forcibly some white paint right into there. I want this to be very bright. I'm just gonna go right over that. I'll put it back in,
if I decide I want it, because we don't make mistakes. There. Now, we can take our blender brush and very gently just blend that right in. That'll end up being a
nice, gorgeous bright spot in our painting when it's done. See there, just blend it all together. Look at that. See that contrast? It just jumps right out at you. That's what we're looking for. There. Tell you what, while we got
the old blender brush going, watch here, watch here, watch here. Take a little bit of
that nice lavender color. Let's paint in, maybe the indication of just a happy cloud
that lives right here. Very soft, very soft. Very, very soft. See, we're just working in layers. I want this cloud to look
like it's in front of that. So, put the thing that's
farthest away in first, then begin working
forward, forward, forward. That's all you have to do. There it is, there it is. We just let it work right on around. See there? I get excited when I see these. They turn me on. There. I like to play with color. Little bit of the bright red and white. Just vary these colors. Just vary them back and forth and around and around and around. Something like that. I'm gonna put in several
little clouds here. You know, in one of the earlier shows, I showed the biggest squirrel
that I had ever seen. I'm gonna put him up and
let you see him again. I'm just gonna be dropping in
some of these little things. I won't do anything you don't see. This rascal is something else. I have never seen a squirrel this big. This is called a Sherman's fox squirrel. He's as big as a small kitty-cat. Very docile, very quiet little squirrel. This one is quite a pet. He belongs to my friend, Cindy, one of the rehab ladies that
lives around Orlando there. She takes care of him. She's turned him loose
several times (laughs). He won't go away. He's sort of like one of
my squirrels that I have. I keep turning him loose, too, and he comes back. But, now this squirrel's big enough he knocks on the door and comes on in. There we go. Isn't he something? I like these animals. I really like to play with them. I'm just coming right along here and putting in all kind of little things. We can just sort of
blend this entire thing. All right! But isn't that a dynamite sky? I tell you what, if you have a room in your home that's sort of dull and blase, you do a painting like this and hang it. When you walk in the room, the color will jump on you. Makes you feel good. Humph! I get carried away, I'm sorry. Let's have a little something
down here on the bottom. Shoot! We've wasted all of our
time up here in the sky. Let's put a little something. I'll just take a little of that lavender, since it's going so nice. Let's go down here. Let's just put some of that
nice lavender color down here. About like that. Little more of that lavender color. There. Maybe just put that right down in here. There we are. So we just go all the way across with it. Shoot, doesn't matter. There. Maybe we'll have a little mountain that lives way, way back
in the distance here. Let's do that. Let me find my knife. Just take that same lavender color, put it out here. We'll put some white with it. Maybe... Oh, yeah, something about like that. There, I like that. You just sort of adjust the
color 'til it's what you want. Cut off a little roll of paint. Let's have a little mountain, first-- Maybe we'll do a couple of mountains. We'll have one that lives far away. This little mountain, he
lives way, way back there, almost to the edge of nowhere. There, we just drop him on, drop him on. Let me grab a two-inch brush. We'll grab that and firmly pull it. Just pull it. Then just blend the base of it out. So, all you see is a nice
silhouette sitting there. 'Cause this one's far away,
quiet little mountain. Quiet little dude, he lives way up there. Now, take some Prussian
blue, alizaran crimson, much more crimson than blue. Put a little black in there. Maybe even a little Van Dyke brown. I like that too. Cut off our little roll of paint. It should live right on
the edge of your knife. Then we go up here and-- Here's a mountain. I don't want it to get too big. I like to paint big mountains. I sort of have to physically
restrain myself sometime, 'cause I'll just let a mountain get right out of the painting. It just keeps on going. There. I do like to paint mountains, though. But I've got one young
feller that outpaints me when it comes to mountains. That's my son, Steve. You might have saw him in
some of the other shows. He's just one of the most
dynamite mountain painters I've ever seen. There we go. Pull that. He was out teaching. We didn't get him on this series. Maybe next series, I'll
get him back in here. We rent Steve out. He travels all over the
country and teaches classes to literally hundreds
and hundreds of people. He's tied up right now. There we go. Just blending that out. Tell you what, let's put
a little bit of highlight. I'll use a little bit of that
bright red, little white. I don't want much
highlight, just enough so we see a little sun
zinging right across there. Tiny little amount. There it goes. Zoom! There it goes, a little bit more. Zoom! Right there. I'm just gonna blend it down. By down, I mean, just work it in so it's not so distinct. I want it to be very quiet. Don't want much. That's really, really
about all we're gonna do. Just enough to give the indication of a little highlight here and there. Maybe there's another little
peninsula right there. I don't know, wherever you want it. Then grab it and go down. That's good enough. Let's see. I don't want much back here, or it will ruin that illusion of distance. Maybe, in our world, we have a little hip. Just touch, pull down. Maybe there's just a little footy hill that lives back here,
right below that mountain. Somewhere like that. Just pull straight down. Right below it, same color. Decide where you want reflections to be. Pull them down like that. See? Then go gently across. We have instant reflections. Little white, put little bright red in it, just a little. Just enough to warm it up. We'll go right up here. We'll just put in a
happy little water line. Lives right along in there. There. See, that little bit of
pink that you put in there, just sort of makes it go with the painting and sort of makes it just stand out. I like that. There we go. All right! Shoot, we're coming right along here. Let's have some fun. You know me. I like trees, Let's make a tree. Clean off a spot to work here. Take some black, Prussian blue, some Van Dyke brown. Put some crimson in there. All those good, dark, rich colors. Let me clean the old knife off here. Good, dark color. Should look black on the palette. We'll take a fan brush today. Load it full of color, a lot of paint. A lot of paint. Let's go over here. Maybe, in our world, toop, toop, toop. There is now. Maybe there's a little
tree, happy little tree. He lives right there. There he comes. This will be very dark, though. With this kind of sky you'd
almost have silhouettes here. Very dark. Very, very dark. And that dark contrast is
gorgeous against the sky. There. Maybe? Yeah, why not? Have another one lives right there. There it is. Boy, that tree looks a little sickly. We may have to work on him. By sickly, I mean, he looks
like he had a bad year. Didn't get much water
one year or something. Times are rough. There. While we have that color there, let's take a little of it
and just put down here. I'm gonna have some
reflections in the water. You can put them in any
old way you want them. See there? Just take the brush, pull straight down. Go across. Instant reflections. We just use that brush and go ahead and put in a little bit
of land from the side. What the heck? There. I want some trees on the other side. (chuckles) You know me. I like a full tree here and there. Maybe in our world
there's a couple of trees live right there. Now there's three. See, just put in the tops. Put in a few little indications. Looks like a whole bunch of trees. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Toop! Big one, gotta have one big tree. There. There we go, big old tree. Big strong tree lives right up here. Looks out over this
gorgeous, gorgeous scene. Something like that. Maybe back here we can see the indication of a couple more little trees. They're sort of hid behind. All we're doing right now is just putting on the background color. I'm gonna come along
with a few highlights. We'll bring all those together. OK. Let me see here. There's one. Got too many brushes going today. I'm gonna take a two-inch brush because that's what was handy. Maybe there's a bush
that lives right there. Lot of nice bushy areas. Really and truly, you can
just put anything in here. I just wanted to show you, mainly, today how to do a fantastic sky. Very easy, very quick. There. We'll just fill that up with color. There. All right! I'll take a one-inch brush. Let's go into-- We'll get a little white, a little bit of that same color. There, I'm just looking for
a little highlight color but I want it to be mostly
in the lavender hues. There. Whew! Boy, that's nice. It's not too bright, but it's just enough to pull it out so it shows a little bit. Maybe that bush lives in the background. That's all we have to do if it does. All right. Let me see, there's one. Looking for a clean brush again. I'm gonna take a little sap green, a little yellow, a little yellow ochre. This is cad yellow. Grab the Indian yellow, too. Get a little black in there, too. I want this to be a dark green. Dark green, dark green. I'm gonna come right along in here. Dark green, don't make no
bright, shiny thing this dark. Put the indication here and
there and there and here. Some little highlights. Same thing over here. Something like that. See there? All right! Little bit of the liquid white. We'll put in a little
indication of some waterline right underneath there. Something like that, don't need much. OK, put a little of that
green on a fan brush here. I'm just gonna put the
indication here and there. Not much, not much. A little bit of highlight
on some of these trees. Just enough so you know
there's a little green. Over here, too. There's a little bit. There's a little bit. (chuckles) Just drop it in. There. Darker, darker, darker
down here towards the base. All right! Maybe we'll have a little
path (whistles) right there. Just a little path. All right! Take a little bit of that green color fill that up just to finish
up the little painting. Just to give you an idea. The big thing in this
painting is a gorgeous sky. I hope you try it because you'll like it. The old clock on the wall
tells me it's about time to finish this one, call it a day. I've certainly enjoyed our time together. I hope you try this one. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend.
