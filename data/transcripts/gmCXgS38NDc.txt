- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you can join us today because today is a very special day. You know, from time to time on this show we've had some fantastic guest artists but today it's my
privilege to introduce you to absolutely my favorite guest artist. This is my son, Steve. He's a fantastic artist. He travels all over the
country and he teaches, literally, thousands of
people the joy of painting. Steve, welcome to our show. We're glad to have you here, today. - Thanks, dad. - Tell you what, I'm gonna turn this show over to Steve, let him do a fantastic painting for you and I'll see you soon. Steve, it's all yours son. - Thanks. So far on the canvas, I've got a thin, even coat of liquid white. They'll be running your colors across the screen for you. I'm gonna start off by
using my two inch brush and maybe just a little
bit alizarin crimson. Just go into a tiny bit
of the color at one time because you don't want to get too much on there; end up with your sky on fire. Just a little bit. Then right around in here. Whoa, we better call
the fire trucks out now. It's like I almost got too much. We can always blend some
of that out, though. Maybe a little down here, like we're gonna have some water later. Then you don't even
have to clean your brush just go into a little
bit of Prussian blue. That's an even stronger color, so you want to use less of it. Just a little. And you see right up
here where I'm putting these dark blue shapes is where I can lay some clouds in later. But just little x's everywhere. Just kind of let the shapes get smaller as you come towards the center. Start off like this and then
turn it kind of horizontal. Maybe, just a little bit more of that. Prussian blue with just a touch of sap green. Some straight, horizontal
strokes down here. The reason you want
'em straight is because you want to indicate the
stillness and the flatness of the lake. If you had moving water,
you could do it differently. Okay, something like that. You need to wash your brush out. (banging sound) So much for that pair of pants. Then you just blend the pink a little bit, like that. Try to get out all those little streaks, if you can. But at the same time
you're trying to leave a few little dark areas. And pretty much the same thing down here but just straight. You don't want to blend
out all those little horizontal lines, they kind of help. But only in the water. The sky should be soft and the water can be a little bit crisper. Maybe this one will have a mountain in it and some clouds above. I'm gonna start off with
the mountain first, though. So I can bring some clouds around it. A little bit of Prussian
blue and van dyke brown in equal parts. And maybe a touch of midnight black and crimson in that, too. Leave you're color really dark. This is gonna be one of
those closer mountains. Maybe right about in here somewhere. You can always change
things, if you want to. Just make them a little bigger. Of course, you can get a
little carried away with that. Probably have to nail another canvas on top of this one, if you did. That's okay, though, as
long as you're having fun. Once you get the basic shape in there, just kind of scrape away the excess paint. A lot of my students, while I'm traveling around teaching classes, will ask me, "How come you leave that edge up there? "Is that necessary?" I always tell them, "Well,
yeah, if you're doing "a foreground mountain it is. "But if you're doing one that's way off "in the distance, you want those edges "nice and soft." Now that you got that
part in just pull it out a little bit with your big brush. Go with the angle of the mountain, always down, like this. And then over here, pull to the left. You're pretending each peak is split down the middle and you're pulling to the left on the left-hand side, right on the right-hand side. You can almost see impressions of highlights right away. Then blend out the bottom a little bit. Make it soft. Now, I think I'm gonna
put a cloud in there. Just a little bit of liquid white on the fan brush. Then I'm gonna go through
some titanium white. Maybe even put a dot
of bright red in there. Let's see, what about one right here? Just making little circles and don't kill all your dark areas. They're real important. If you lose some of your pink, just add some more. It's up to you, though. Some people don't like pink, others of us do. I think purple is
probably my favorite color 'cause I like blue and red equally. Okay, something like that up there and maybe a little one right in here. Could be anywhere. Then with the big brush
just blend a little. Only blending out the
bottoms of the clouds and I'm using the top corner of the brush. Just like that. Go over
them a couple times, real lightly. Maybe right over here,
this cloud will shoot right over into the
actual mountain itself. Only if you want it to, though. Right over the top of it, even. Don't be scared of these big brushes. Sometimes they seem like they're so large, they're just gonna mess
up everything, but, in the long run if you
learn how to use them, you can get more accomplished at one time and it looks even better than it does with a small brush. Now, if you take a little
bit of highlight color. Which would be your titanium white, with your bright red, just like that. Get a nice roll on the knife and come in here. You can put on a little bit of snow. Now make sure that when you're doing this you don't push, or anything, on the knife. You want it be a very general thing. Almost like your letting the bumps on the canvas just take
the paint they need as you drag it down. Didn't have to be thousands of peaks, or anything, either. A mountain many times will look better if you just do something simple on it. I find that most of the paintings I do, if I try real hard on
them, people look at them and they say, "Well,
they're just over done." Or, "Too much." I think simplicity is
probably a little bit more important than
trying to clutter up one. Then a little bit of
Prussian blue and white for shadow color. If you want to make your mountain look even closer at this
point, instead of just putting the blue on by
itself, you could even take a little bit of the
dark color that you used originally for the
mountain and put that in behind it first. See what happens, there? Gets really, really, upfront. Right behind the highlight is where you have shadows. So anywhere you see that bright white just come in, put a little blue on there. Right behind it. This is a huge mountain here. I'm gonna just let you guess whether it got out of control on me or I meant to do it this way, though. Back to the big brush one more time. Tap in at the bottom of the mountain just a little bit. This'll be where we make
a little mist in there. Lift up into that. What you're trying to do is lift out the tap marks and diffuse the bottom of the mountain. Make it look really misty. Like it falls right into the pitcher. That's southern talk there, "pitcher". That's really what you
pour Kool Aid out of, I guess, but... Now down at the bottom of the mountain we're probably going
to want some foothills and things like that. You notice I always
stand back a little bit and take a look at it to make sure that everything's going okay. Sometimes I tilt my
head at different angles and stuff like that, too. A little bit of sap
green and van dyke brown for this. Once you get a color mixed up there you want to take a little bit of white put with it to lighten it up. Maybe we'll have some foothills that are kind of big since we got a big mountain, too. Seems like that'll go together. All you have to do is
keep the brush vertical. Just bounce it right across there. You don't have to go with the same colors that I'm going with. I would on my first one, but, as you paint several of them you'll notice that sometimes your colors look even better. When I first started I
always used the same colors as dad did. Now I use different ones. And some I like better and some I don't. Now underneath that, if you go back with the big brush one more time and mist. Did you ever notice that, while I'm doing everything in the painting, I'm always knocking off the bottom edge of it? By doing that that's how you make things look further away. And you could even put a little bit more of the same brown and sap green in that color to darken it down again. Come right back in between a few of these and make it look like levels of foothills coming down. See, there you go. Now one thing that you want to beware of, right here, you don't want to knock out your whole lake. You could end up coming
all the way down in here. You just want to do a little bit and stop. I think a lot of being an artist or doing a painting has something to do with what not to do as well as what to do. 'Cause I have a habit of overdoing things. I'm gonna do that much on that part and leave it alone. I just have to force
myself to do that, though. I always want to play
with it a little more. Okay, fan brush and a little bit of that same brown and sap green. This time we'll leave the white out. Maybe right here we'll have a pine tree. Just using the corner of the brush. The right-hand corner only, if you'r right-handed. As you get further and further down on the tree, you want to push in harder and use more of the brush. In other words, you start
with the corner of it and then about half of it's used and then the whole thing down here. From this pine tree, since you already got it in there, you could just pretend that there'll be a piece
of land across there, like that and kind of just smoosh it right in there. I think for some of the
people that I've taught to do this, what makes
it difficult for them is they're trying to think so hard about the artistic thing. About, "Oh, I just have
to get this perfect." You know things like that. Main thing is just to
get some color on there. That's what I tell 'em. Get some color on the canvas. That way you can work with it and maybe on the next step you can get what you're looking for. 'Cause it always looks
better the more you do. That little guy there is just a baby. It's a nice idea to cut off the side of the painting over here, too. I usually like to do that. Kind of leads you right
towards the mountain more. So just something like that, on those. Then, if you take a one inch brush, you can come over here
and do some cad yellow. Pull through there. We can make a few little bushes out these. Now, I don't use a ton of yellow by itself, but, maybe we'll just have one bright yellow one right there. If you're paint won't stick use a drop of thinner. Little bit more yellow. Maybe this time with a touch of red in it. Make sort of an orange-y color. What the heck, I'll put a red one right in the middle. There we go. You want to remember, while you're doing your paintings at home, that just because you might not be totally happy with something doesn't mean that somebody else won't be. I find that the paintings I do that I dislike the most,
people like the most. So you want to keep that in mind. A lot of fall colors today. Might as well go up and put a little bit of those same colors on the pine trees up there, too. Almost forgot, we wouldn't want to forget something to hold those pine trees up. Maybe a little van dyke brown and a roll on the knife. You can just go in there and touch a couple of times like that. Maybe highlight with a
little lighter color. White or light brown, it's up to you. You can take the fan
brush and highlight those with your same yellows, or even touch a little green in it. Now you don't want too much highlight on your pine trees. That'll do ya' more
pain than good on those. Gotta have those darks. That's probably one of the most important rules I ever learned is it takes dark to show light. Guess who taught me that? Maybe if you pull down a little bit of that green you can get a reflection out of that. I just added a tiny bit
on my one inch brush of that same green mother color that I'm using. I"ll show you a simple
way to reflect color. Just take that same
bush color that you used on the brush, pull down a little bit, maybe brighter here and there. For that red one, a little red. Then you can just take your big brush back in there, pull down on it, wipe it off a little,
and go right across that. Now underneath all this stuff, we're gonna need something to hold it up. Looks like land'll probably
do a good job, huh? Van dyke brown, in pure
form, and if you get a little roll on there
you can come up here and just kind of pull some of that across. And if you're going to angle it, angle it really far out to the right. I mean a really long incline. Stay away from pulling it straight down. That's a no-no. If you use a little bit of
brown and white together, that'll give you a highlight color. Just throw a little bit of that on there. I have a tendency to drag my fingernails down here, through that. That's how flat you're holding the knife. That's a good indication. Maybe a little bit of grass on top of this with that one inch brush. Just like you made your bushes. Just hold it on its side and push in. Try to make it look something like rows. Once again, if it's not sticking, you need more paint thinner in it. Let's get rid of those fingernail marks. There we go, eraser-mate brush. While I got it in my hand, I can pull a reflection out of this land here. I try to do as much as I
can with that same brush before I put it down. Okay, a little of of
liquid white on the knife. Spread that around real good. Little bit of blue with it, maybe. Any blue. Let's get a little tiny roll of that on the knife and go up
here for a water line. Something like that. Just right underneath
the edge of that land. Kind of push in hard, trying to get it to come off the bottom of the knife. Let's go to the one inch brush and over here we might have a... ...a large something. Heck I'm not even sure what it's gonna be yet. No, you know I'm just teasing you. It'll be a big pine tree. Make sure that top's skinny on it. No matter how wide it is. I usually just get the shape in first and then go back and darken it up. But you notice if you don't try real hard on something, a lot of times it does come out better. You know, more rough or realistic looking. I think our minds have a tendency to think more logical and less
artistic from all that school. See, now it's getting
nice and full in there. Always keep it a little
darker in the center, too. And then down here,
maybe just a little bit of this kind of action. Better be real careful
on this part, though, wouldn't want to mess up or anything. Then, just like the other side, maybe a little trunk
up there in that tree. Something like that. Little bit of brown and white on top of it for a highlight. Just like that. If you don't like some of your trunk or you just want to diffuse some of it, you can go in and hit
with that mother color a few times and it sets
it right down in there. Let's see here, a drop of paint thinner
and some cad yellow and a little bit of sap
green and we'll be able to put some highlight on that tree. Highlighting is kind of a pattern, you'll notice. As I come down here, I'm kind of going 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4 like that. I kind of count it off in my head or sing a little song. Some people say,"Middle,
middle, side, side." And then down around here maybe a little bit of bush action. Any old color you want. I like bright colors, myself. A lot of times when I'm doing these foreground bushes I think to myself they should have a little bit more detail in them or something,
but, I don't necessarily try to put any detail on them. But when I'm done with
them I put a little strip of land underneath, it really helps a lot. The way you do that is van dyke brown and you just pull it right in there. Just like that. Then a little bit of
van dyke brown and white on top of it, maybe. There you go, there's some land. As usual, a little grass
on top of the land. Well, it looks like that about does it for this one today. I hope you've had a really good time watching this show. Maybe even as much fun
as I've had painting it for you. I'm gonna leave this one unsigned for now 'cause I'm running out of time, but, we'll see you next time. (jazz music)
