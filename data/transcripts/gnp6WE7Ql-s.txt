hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today you know we get hundreds of letters here at the joy of painting and one of the things that I read over and over again is people want to learn how to do a basic face just how to paint the human face I think I told you the story of years and years ago when I was going to school that my instructor became a very good friend and after a long period of time he took me aside one even he says Bob I want to tell you the truth I want you to go out and paint bushes and trees because that's where your heart is and leave portrait painting to someone else well I thought today I would bring that gentleman here his name is John Thumb he comes to us from Coeur d'Alene Idaho and he's one of the most fantastic portrait painters in the country and he's going to show us today how just to do a basic figure how to block in a face how to get the proportions right the things that we normally have a lot of problems with and I think he's going to show you a technique that you'll find easy enough that you can do at home with very little practice John welcome to the joy painting we're so glad to have you here today well thank you for having me Bob good John what are you going to do today I'm going to explain a technique called the wipeout technique it has to do primarily with the surface that we're painting on which is a shellac surface Bob and allows a person with a rag to get up here and just wipe down this canvas and create lights that are already on there or apply paint and then just simply wipe it out with the rag it's a subtractive process as well as an additive process we'll start today with just the basic shape of the head the human head is roughly eight inches high and approximately six inches wide these are just all average dimensions first thing that we do is find what's called the median line that's the line that transverses from the center of the the center of the forehead right now through the nose through the center of the lips down the chin right down the base of the neck and we can put that line anywhere we want to and be able to tip and turn the head in any kind of a fashion that we choose let's say we want a three-quarter view of the head on a tilt the head is sort of an egg shape like so up if we cut through the center that's roughly where the eyes are the eye line if we go halfway between that point and the base of the chin that's where we find the bottom of the nose this area right in here which collects some shadow then if we go halfway between that point and the base of the chin that's roughly where the mouth lies now you can see by just putting in some shadow areas in the eye sockets this area in here the nose is simply nothing much more than a wedge shape on the dark side there's usually quite a lot of quite a lot of shadow collects right underneath the lower lip so what we're doing is finding those shadow areas and then we'll come back later on and start defining features but what we want to do is find these shadow areas and make this head begin to have some three dimension so I'll play the devil's advocate here John if you don't mind basically what you're going to do is apply the shadows first and then pull the highlights out is that correct right Bob if we come back in here with the rag and establish a light source first we'll say that the light is going to be coming from from this direction I'll make a little arrow up here so don't forget what side the light is coming from well that means that then we can come back with the rag and find some light that would hit on this cheek over here a good deal of the forehead would be casting extreme light this lip on this side the plane and then down here on the chin it's fascinating that you can do with a rag what most of us work so hard to do with a brush and so someone at home doing this needs only a minimum amount of equipment is that correct well it's a quick and simple method that really requires very little in the way of tools as you can see I'm primarily working with just two sizes of brushes one smaller one and a larger brush and these are bristle brushes that you're using right just oil painting brushes this is a half an inch brush this is a one inch brush and we'll come back and establish the lips the lips really are nothing much more than a couple of triangles that are then hooked together a little bit here we'll find some more light that would hit on the lower lip generally speaking the upper lip is in shadow the lower lip has some light cast on it then back to shadow again for underneath the lower lip but just by putting that highlight in a little shadow in there John ups I see a lift there it's beginning to develop now let's let's find the eyes there's roughly the distance of an eye between the eyes if we were to determine the width of the eye would take up an area about like so Bob and the same with this one and then and the width of an eye in between we can come back with the rag and find the highlight that would come down the plane the plane of the nose I've designed a little more dark underneath the underneath the nose right in this area now the corners of the mouth really control expression if we want to find a smile we can move this move this paint around and first thing you know where we've established a trace of a smile here but what I see here already is you know I'm always telling people when I'm painting that we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents that it looks to me like there's nothing that you can't correct change fix move shift in any way that you desire on this it's the most flexible way that that I've found to work a big disappointment disappointment for me as a student was that I get what I felt was a good drawing started and then maybe I wanted to change it in some fashion and the surface that I worked on was usually a gesso surface that was absorbent and once the drawing was down there there was no way you could shift or move or change it around I understand the paint would stain the canvas and you were you were stuck with that right and not with this method this method allows change at any at any point what could you use this method to say paint animals sure you could use it to paint any anything even landscapes Bob oh maybe I wasn't one of the shows in the future we'll we'll get you back here and have you do a landscape with us and show how you would use this to do a landscape or maybe maybe one day you'd come back and paint like the little owl I had on one of the shows earlier sure that'd be fine Bob and I enjoy that this to me looks like the seaport on photographs that I remember when I was younger and I think they're still doing them a lot in around the country where you have the brown tones I'm working with a limited palette here primarily burnt sienna raw umber and that's why it has that look about it I love this effect it as I say it looks like the old type photographs to me I still have some of those of my family from years and years ago that this is just defining the nose and as I say the nose is just a basic wedge shape we can come back and find a few more values maybe just the trace of the nostril well I remember when I was trying to paint heads like this then the nose always seemed to be the thing that I had the most problem with is that normal now the nose is a difficult area it has to it has to line up properly this is a key to the whole thing this median line that goes right down the center of the forehead which is pretty much disappeared now you can still see traces of it here so everybody seems to have this problem with the nose I wouldn't I wasn't the only one this no nose planes where they weren't you weren't by yourself I'm seems like I remember one artist that had trouble painting here so he just removed one old Vincent you know I had talked to John about maybe doing a portrait of me and he said well that would be a little bit too simple because all you'd have to do is paint a brillo pad and put heads in it I wouldn't go and tell that story but I decided to whatever I'm going to tell on you couldn't restrain yourself off just paint a brillo pad with eyes that okay now did you just put some eyes in there how about me I always shifted to a darker color to burnt sienna and we'll ruff in the hair almost taking on a clown like appearance here and at Bob mm-hmm it really is I like that though I like the colors that you're using the earth tones are so pretty here's another area where expression lies in the eyebrows then by changing the eyebrows you can actually change the expression of the whole portrait you certainly can let's do it okay you mean at this point now you can still with this technique change your mind you could you could turn this person and give him a different expression any kind of an expression let's say we want to go from from the smile to a to a bit of a frown and let's try that we'll move the mouth up slightly turn down the corners hmm he's looking meet her already find that line that sometimes goes from the wing of the nose down to the corner of the mouth we almost have a open mouth screaming kind of a look now change it again by moving this lower lip up now you're literally pushing that paint with your finger just moving it around with the finger and the rag is there any special type of rag that you need for this or just just a cotton rag acrylics don't work real well they're not absorbent enough hmm and that little turning there just made the end of the nose alright if you want to start defining nice we can pull a little light out and then find that that upper eyelid that cuts across the eye I'll be doing more dark in here it just sort of it sort of happens well you're making me believe that I can paint portraits again I may have to go back and sure you could Bob if it's always good anybody can it's the the foundation of the thing is finding the major planes of the face and the the proper placement of the features and by dividing it the way you showed us at the beginning it just clearly find that median line find the eyeline the base of the nose and the mouth all there is to it I'm fascinated with the way you keep changing this person I've seen two or three different people here already different expressions and you can still move the paint we can also continue to change the lighting effect if we want to cast this whole side and more shadow we come back and apply more paint smooth it around this sort of looks like Rembrandt lighting where one side of the face is almost totally in shadow and the high side is quite bright Kira Sakura lighting is what it's called or REM lamp Rembrandt lighting that may be one of my favorite types of lighting I like to see photographs done like that now you're painting on a Mason night panel today if I'm not mistaken that's right has two coats of gesso on it and then a coat of shellac and the shellac is what allows us to move this paint around so quickly and easily okay now we're what getting into a neck on the neck line over here trace of a shoulder and that easy we have the basics basis of a neck try to find this depression that's right in the center of the rib cage right here do you have to have a study or good knowledge of anatomy to paint portraits or can you just learn this and just work at it it helps to understand Anatomy but it's not absolutely necessary if you know these these basic divisions the placement of the eyes and nose in the mouth simplifies things greatly so then a person who does not have an extensive knowledge of anatomy can be a pretty good portrait painter I understand of course that is portraiture is a specific approach to painting the head and before before you can do specific work such as portraiture you really should do a lot of heads in it just a kind of a general way working from from memory and and your imagination when I do you prefer to work from like a photograph or to have a person actually sitting there when you know I'd really much rather have somebody sit for me then then use photographs but even though that they're moving it you can pretty well work with it right what you just do to the eye there all of a sudden that eye is beautiful I picked out the the light that's on the upper lid now we can come back and put some dark in above that above that eyelid define eyes find just the don't want to outline the eyes but if we can find that where that lower lid would be we can come back and pick some more light out in here is there a big difference in painting adults and children or is that pretty much the same well the basic approach is the same the dimensions of the header are somewhat different the child's head is what more round more round wider the relationship is not so long and and wider understand and the compression of the features the features are all pulled in tighter together okay now this is this will do what this defines the mouth or there again we don't want to to just draw up one line for the mouth find the corners of the mouth and there's usually more darkness in this area right in here in the corners and there again that's that's area that defines the expression and by changing the corner of the mouth you could literally change the expression on a figure when you're painting it like right another method for removing paint besides the rag is a dry brush like this I think you do this sometimes don't you Bob right where we use a dry brush to pick up excess pick up paint and move it around pull out areas find lost and found lines and you're going to pick out some some more highlights now ran some more lights right in here head around the chin area maybe darken this lower lip slightly fyz are a bit too close together we can move things just start shifting things over you mean you can literally take a brush and move his I just move things in the direction that you want them to go in and then come back and re-establish things again so you're serious when you say you really can't make a mistake with this it's a very flexible approach well this is this is the way I have to paint and I need the room to make an error now and then and it doesn't create a major catastrophe so this is exactly the kind of painting that I'm looking for and I know a lot of people who watch the shows like to be able to to be flexible and to move change their mind and to just really enjoy it and I think this is very adaptable this might be for them I have to mention John has a gallery in Coeur d'Alene Idaho that's him and his wife Kathy run and John has mentioned if anybody ever stops by Coeur d'Alene and you're there as a tourist or enjoying the scenery stop by and see him and look at some of the works that he has on display I think you would enjoy immensely seeing how versatile this man is and what he can do and the gallery's open most of the time and just just stop in and say hello and spend a little time with them you shoot you might even talk you into doing a portrait on the spot I'll be doing John laning a little hair now roughing in the hair right this changes the appearance greatly no brillo pad no brillo pad today but maybe another day I'm never going to forget that man tells me all he has to do is paint a brillo pad with eyes he has my portrait maybe I maybe I'll have to change my hairstyle in the future there that is really something I'm so impressed see how that hairline changed things Bob it looks like a different person yeah it is a different person just with a few strokes totally different person can get back in here now and pull out some highlights and you're still just using the rag and lifting paint off violets same procedure all the way through am really changed a great deal now if you were going to turn this into a portrait that had all the colors in etc how would you carry that out you'd let this dry of course let this dry and then come back and carefully match up the tonality of each of the areas find the the light side of the face and the half tones by half tones I mean all those mid-range values and then the darks and just apply those those colors right over the top of this one when it was dry but yeah I have to tell him you know years ago you painted a portrait of Steve for me oh I remember that yeah Steve was in the fifth grade and that's back when he was only about four foot tall he's now six foot five his everybody knows that son of a guns he grew up on me but I still had that portrait and it's in my collection of art it's maybe one of my most prized possessions I think it's not absolutely spectacular would would you have any objection maybe in one of the later shows I would bring that in and and let everybody see it I'd be delighted Bob if you did that I think people at home would enjoy seeing what you can do with this if you just continue on after you have your your basic wipe out done in and as you were saying begin adding your colors in I think we still have time to narrow this head down a little bit a little more cheekbone and even at this stage you can still change and still add more paint or subtract more paint and you can do that all the way through are you still teaching classes John occasionally Bob I don't teach as much as I used to but I still enjoy teaching the basic construction of the head well we're getting close to being at the end of the show I'd like to have them put up on the screen a couple of couple little paintings that you brought with you there's one of me that you did and that's was from a photograph and the way I look several years back and this one you've went ahead and put all the colors in right huh this is a sketch of a lady then in the same technique is this here's her here's a fellow that looks like he had a rough night and this is my favorite this is a beautiful beautiful portrait here I really like this one John the old clock on the wall tells us it's about time to to shut it down for today I really and truly enjoy your being here I thank you very much for sharing with my friends a fantastic technique I look forward to seeing you again from John and I I'd like to wish all of you happy painting and god bless Oh Oh you
