- Hey, welcome back, certainly
glad you could join us today. I thought today we'd do a painting that's just very pretty to
make you feel good inside, so let's start out and have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what we got up here. I have my standard old 18x24
inch double primed canvas, but you use whatever size
is convenient for you. I've just covered the entire canvas with a very, very thin
coat of Liquid White. So it's all wet and ready to go, so let's just have some fun today. Maybe we'll start out with a
little, tiny two-inch brush and to that, we'll add a
little bit of Indian Yellow. Just a small amount, don't need much. Thought we'd just, let's just do something that's bright and shiny and pretty. As I say, it'll make you feel good inside. Alright, let's put a
little yellow right there. Something about like that. There we go. Without cleaning the brush, I'm going to go right into Yellow Ochre. Yellow Ochre is sort of a gold color. It's very nice, warm color, I like it. There. If you put two eyes and a
big smiley face on there, we'll have somebody's
portrait right there. Nah, not really. There we go, let's just
blend that together. Maybe a little more of the Ochre. Blend it out, somewhere
like that, we don't care. Doesn't make any difference, 'cause as you know, we
don't make mistakes, we just have happy
accidents here on canvas. Okay, now we'll wash the 'ole brush off. Here we wash our brushes
since these are oil paints with odorless paint thinner. Shake it off. It just cover everything
in about a block radius. Now then, I wanna mix up, oh, let's take some Phthalo Blue, I'm gonna make a pretty good
pile into Alizarin Crimson. Just mix it together, Phthalo
Blue and Alizarin Crimson, proportionately, much, much, much, much
more Crimson than Blue, much more, there we go. We'll just make a nice lavender
color, 'bout like that. Okay, good. Now, you may wanna put
a little white over here and test it to see what color it is, because it just sorta
looks black on the palette and you might wanna test it. Alright, I'm gonna put
a little bit of this on my two-inch brush, then I wanna start on the outside edge and just begin blending that in. I don't wanna dark color
here, just a little lavender. Just to bring it up like that. As I say, I thought
we'd do something today that's just very bright and sparkly, maybe even something that
has an autumn feel to it. What the heck. There we go, I'm gonna put a little bit on this side over here too. We don't want him left out. There. Just sort of blend it around. Like that. Okay, maybe right in there, and that's about all we're looking for. There. Now I have several brushes going, I'm gonna grab another one and put Titanium White on it, just a little Titanium White and come right up here
at about the center. Take a little white and
begin blending outward. I want this to be very
bright right in here. So take a little bit of the Titanium White and just really work it
in there and work outward. Once you get the brush
contaminated with color, try not to take it back into the center. You can do this as many times as you want to achieve any desired lightness, but I would suggest
that you clean the brush each time you go back to the center, otherwise you're gonna
drag that dirty color right back into the light area. Now then, we can take it very lightly, just blend the entire canvas and just sort of bring it
all together that easy. There, now let's sort of give us a nice warm-ish glow right out there. Now then, while I got
that 'ole brush going, now let's see, I got another one here that has lavender on it, we'll use that. Let's put a little bit
of that lavender color right on the brush, just tap
a little into the bristles and maybe, maybe in
our world back in here, I don't know, just start
making decision here. Maybe there are some little
things that live back in here, wherever, we're just gonna make some little background indications, things that live far away. There. As you run out of paint,
just turn the brush over, use the other side, either side. There we go. Just some little indications, I don't know exactly what they are and I don't know that we
really care at this point, just background material. Sometimes you can take the brush and just hold it vertically and put in all kinds of
indications wherever. Once again, this is just
background material, we're not really concerned
with it at this point, maybe later on we will be, but right now, it's just
background material. There. As you begin running out of paint, you can put things that are closer to the light source up here, because they would be lighter. There we go. Just little hints of things
that you can see back here, we don't know where they are. Very quiet little, little quiet things. See 'em? See, it gives the impression
there's things back here, but we don't know what they are, and I really don't know
that even matters right now, just indications. And more little things
that hang out over here, wherever you want 'em. There. Just all kinds of little doers. There we go. We nearly have the whole
thing painted already. That's all it takes. It's really all it takes. Just let your imagination take you to anywhere that you
want to be, that easy. Now we come back and begin making the indication of layers. Do the shape that, in your mind, is the farthest away first
and then work forward, and it'll create depth, even in little backgrounds
things like this, and chances are, we'll
cover most of it up, but some of it may show through and people will think that you worked for long periods of time
to create these illusions. Shh, it's our secret, don't tell, just enjoy, just enjoy. There. Just let 'em pop right in there. See, each layer gets a little bit darker, and already it looks like you
can see way back in there, and we really haven't done hardly a thing. We'll have a little water, we can just pull some of this down. We'll decide where the water lives later. But we have a little bit
in there if we need it. Let me take a little bit
of the, little bit of blue, little Phthalo Blue and
just add right in there, so it has a little blue-ish cast to it, but it's still mostly lavender, itt's just more to the blue side now. Alright. Let's see, here's a brush, we'll put a little white
on it, just Titanium White, maybe in our world right there. Maybe there's light slinging
right across the water, want that to be nice and shiny. Okay, back to my brush with the lavender. I'm just sorta going back and forth. There, maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right here,
comes right out like that. There, and we'll pull a little
reflection down for him. That easy, that easy. Who knows, who knows, who knows? Get crazy, maybe over here, maybe there's another little peninsula that comes out into the water, so it looks like that
water 's back behind there. There, once again, just a
little reflection underneath by pulling straight down
and then going across, and that's all there is to it. Take that knife, a little
bit of Liquid White, maybe put the least little
touch of Bright Red, just enough to pink it up a little, just give it a little pink-ish flavor. Pull it out flat, cut across, let's do that slow so you
can see it, cut across. Let's go up in here then we can take and with that, just cut an indication of just a little water line
that lives right up in there. Something like that. I don't want a real distinct one, just a hint, just a hint of color
right in there like so. There we go. Alright, now already, look
at the amount of depth and distance that's in
that, it's that simple. Just by varying the shades, now you could even go in here and take you knife and cut
in little sticks and twigs, sometimes in between
all these little areas. See, there they come. All these little things
help create the illusion of distance in your painting. There we are, that's
enough to get us started. Now then, tell you what,
let's have some fun here. Maybe in our world, maybe
we'll just keep using the 'ole two-inch brush, it
seems to be working pretty good. Nah, changed my mind,
let's go to a round brush. That's the beauty of this, you can just change anytime you want. I'm gonna take a little round brush, still going into the lavender-y color. Put a little background
tree, background for a tree that lives right there. There, a little darker. Each layer gets a little bit darker. Alright, now maybe this tree lives on this side of the water. Tell you what, let's put a
little tree trunk in there. For that, I'm gonna take
a little Van Dyke Brown and Dark Sienna mixed together, load the brush full of
color, a lot of color, see, both sides, and
I'm gonna take one side and just take it through
a little bit of white, so I have light on one side,
dark on the other, see? White, dark, ok? Now, we have to decide, here's
our light source right here, so light's gonna come
from both directions, need to keep that in mind, keep the light side of this to the left, need it a little bit lighter, didn't come out quite light
enough so that it shows up, we'll just do it again here. See, get the light and the
dark side both at once, works well. And maybe, yeah, what the
heck, it's working so well, let's do it again. Okay, one more time. We'll give him a little friend. There, now see, we have
tree trunks, that easy. And let me find my little
round brush, there it went. Let's go into a little bit
of, little bit of yellow, little bit of Sap Green,
maybe there's a little green still going on back here. We decided we'd have maybe
a little autumn thing, but maybe there's still
a little green back here. This little small, round
brush does fantastic on trees like this, this is
what it's just wonderful for. Just wonderful. There, just a little
green left back there, even though Jack Frost
may be doing his magic, still a little green on some of these. There, maybe he missed this one. Okay, but surely he will
come back and get it. There. But for right now, still
got a little color in it. We'll just let it blend
right on down to about there, and maybe, now we'll
start playing with color. Maybe there's a little
Yellow Ochre right here, touch of Bright Red once in awhile. Down in here, maybe this
tree has more color on it. Just sort of let it happen. I'm gonna dip the brush
into a small amount of the Liquid White, because as you know, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint, so we're gonna thin it
down just a wee bit, just a little bit. Maybe a little paint
thinner would do better, yes, that's much better, I'm
looking for a lighter color, so I can go back and, yeah,
that's what I'm looking for, right there, wanna
highlight that a little bit. Just wanna highlight that a little bit so it stands out more. Alright. Okay, now, let's see, maybe over
here on the other side, maybe there's a happy little bush that lives over here on this side, more into the green hues,
just play with these colors, back and forth, forth and back, enjoy. Just really and truly enjoy,
that's what it's all about. If painting does nothing else for you, it should make you happy, should make you happy. Alright. Okay, maybe some other
little bush right here in front of that one. Just work in layers, each
layer, think about it, think about it, shoot,
let's get crazy here. Maybe there's some bushes, on this side, too, while I
got the 'ole brush working, we'll put some right down there at the foots of them trees. Who knows where they go? Maybe, yeah, we'll just
bring 'em together. So as you paint, you'll begin to see all these little things,
just practice, just practice. You'll learn to create as you paint. There we go. Little bit of black right in there, I want a dark color in here, so I want to add a little black, maybe a little Prussian Blue. Prussian Blue is much
stronger than Phthalo Blue. I want the foreground to be darker. There. Now then, back to our little oval brush, dip it into a little bit,
little bit of the Liquid White, a little Yellow Ochre,
a little Cad Yellow, maybe even a little Bright
Red, just tap the brush, and we'll go back up in here, ooh, there's a little firecracker,
a little firecracker. There we go, give him a little
friend that lives there. But just that easy. 'Bout like that. There. And another one, just
work in layers though. Try to leave a little
dark between each group, between each and every group. There we are, let's go on the other side and maybe, yeah, there's
a happy little bush right here, too. Something like that. Just varying colors back
and forth, forth and back. There we are, there's another one. Indian Yellow sometimes, Alizarin Crimson and the yellows make some gorgeous colors. Try that too, especially if
you're doing fall pictures. There. Something like so, whatever, whatever. Go back to the 'ole two-inch brush, we'll put a little color on
it here, the same color's that we're using, the
reds and the yellows, all of those beautiful
colors, and some green. We'll come back in here and just begin tapping an indication of some little grassy
areas that live in here. The more you tap this,
the more it picks up the lavender and blue color underneath and it'll just fade away. If you want it distinct,
tap it very few times. The more you tap it, once again, the more it'll pick up
that color underneath and the darker it'll become. Use that knowledge to your advantage. There. Okay, maybe, maybe we'll use some
more of the dark color. We'll put the indication, maybe something that
comes right down here. I'm gonna add a little Dark Sienna. I need a brown in there. There we go. Something about like so, that easy though. That's all it takes. There. Alright, think about the lay of the land when you're putting these in. Okay, guess what? Bravery time. I'm gonna take some Midnight Black, some Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, just mix all three of these together. A lot of paint, a lot of paint. Bravery test, are you ready for this? Maybe in our world there lives big tree, right there, right there. Maybe the big tree has a friend. Right there, there we go. Looks like something I used to make a slingshot out of when I was a kid. Got in a lot of trouble with them. Maybe on this side, here we go, another big 'ole tree. Don't let these big trees
scare you, just drop 'em in. It's your world and you can put a big tree wherever you want it,
wherever you want it, or you can put a little
tree, it's up to you, or even a tiny little tree, whatever. You can put a lot of trees in your world. Now then, let's make several different kinds of trees just for practice. Let's say, take a little Titanium White with the least little
touch of brown in it, little roll of paint, let's
say this tree over here, let's decide it's a birch tree. Just want to show you how
to make several trees here. Maybe this 'ole birch
tree lives right here. Just sort of give it a round pull. I know that doesn't make any sense, but go round like that with a knife when you give it a little pull. There. Chances are, if that one's a birch, his friend will be, too since they live right together here. Alright, right on up. Something like so and you
can put a little touch on the other side, just remember where your light's coming from,
always be aware of that. The other 'ole tree, let's
take some Dark Sienna, little bit of white, and
maybe this tree over here is a different kind, so all
we're gonna do for this one is just touch, touch, let the tree take off what it wants, give you back what's left, just touch. Oh, and when this is dry, you'll be able to actually feel the bark in this tree. There. And, once again, this one's
probably the same kind, so just touch, there, something like that. Take our liner brush,
little bit of thin paint, thinning it with paint thinner, and we'll just put the
indication here and there of an 'ole tree limb or
two that lives out here. I don't know, wherever you want him, wherever you want him. I'll put some leaves up
there if we have time, so it's alright, we don't
care what's up there. Just the indication, a
few of them will show. There. Maybe this little tree got stomped on and he's not doing so good. Maybe he died. Maybe that's all that's left is just a skeleton hanging out here, and the 'ole birch tree's
got a few limbs too, a few 'ole limbs hanging out here enjoying the sunshine. There, wherever, alright. Now then, let's go back
to our little round brush. I'll just use some of
that lavender brown color, it doesn't matter. Here we go. Let's just drop some happy little leaves right up here on these. This little round brush
it doesn't take too long, we'll do that. Fact, I think I'll just close
the whole top of this in, makes an interesting
composition, 'bout like that. There. Anywhere you want 'em to be, up to you, up to you,
maybe right in there even. Ok, I think for this I'm
gonna use, so it'll stand out, I'll make an orange color
out of yellow and red, nice orange color. There, I need some paint
thinner to thin that down so it sticks, got a lot
of paint on here now. There we go. Whew, boy, that's dynamite. Bright rascal, very bright. Little more red, little more yellow. Ooh, I like it, I like that color, gorgeous, that's what I was looking for. That's what I was looking for. There, once again, remember where your light's coming from, work with basic shapes and patterns, few little things on
this other one over here. We'll just use the same basic color. As I see, Jack Frost
has played through here and it's starting to turn
all these gorgeous colors. I'm just looking for an excuse to use a lot of yellows and oranges
'cause I like those colors. If you hang a painting
like that in a room, it brightens the entire room. There we go, something about like so, and that's all it takes. Puts an indication maybe
of a few little things down here at the base of the tree, and with that, we about
have a finished painting. I can take a little red,
a little liner brush, make a quick little signature, and we'll be gone. Hope you've enjoyed this one. With that, we're gonna call it done and from all of us here, I'd like to wish you a happy painting and God bless, my friend. (guitar music)
