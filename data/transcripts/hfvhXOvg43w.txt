- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Thought today we'd just do
a fantastic little painting that I believe you'll really enjoy. So let's start out and have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I got up here. Have my standard old double prime pre-stretched canvas, and today I've taken a little piece of contact paper and just cut an oval out of it. And then we've covered the
whole inside of the oval with a thin, even coat of liquid white. So the canvas is all wet
and it's ready to go so, tell you what, let's
just have some fun today. Today I think I'll start,
oh, let's use a little a little one inch brush. We'll take just the smallest
amount of cad yellow, very, very small amount of cadmium yellow. We don't need much today. Think today we'll do the little seascape that you see at the beginning of the show. And I'll show you how that was made. And this will not be an
exact duplicate of that, but it'll be very close. Ok, we'll just take a
little one inch brush and just make sort of a little
yellow circle right there. Right there. Without cleaning the brush, I'll pick up a least little touch of the yellow ochre. We're really applying
very little color here. There. There's not a great deal
of color on the canvas. Something, oh, about like that. That's fine. It doesn't matter, doesn't matter. There we go. Now then, let me wash the ol' brush. (splashing) K, and we just wash our brush
with odorless paint thinner. (clanking) Since these are oil
paints, that's what we use. There we go. Now then, let's take, mix
up a little color here. I'm gonna take some white and a little thalo green mixed together. Now thalo green is sort
of an emerald green. It's a gorgeous color. Very strong, though. K, I'm gonna wipe off the old knife. Be very careful with
it, you need that much. And we'll put a little of that red on the old one inch brush. And I'm gonna go right out
here, right around that, and just drop in a little
bit of that, like so. I've got a lot of letters from people are asking for just a very
simple little seascape that's quite effective,
and this is the one that I've designed. I think you'll enjoy it. Think you'll enjoy it. Now then, same color except I'm gonna add a little bit of the midnight black. So I have thalo green, little
white, and midnight black. Just wanna dull it down a little bit. Ok. And we'll go right around here with that. (rough brushing) What we're trying to
achieve here is the illusion that it gets progressively darker as it goes out away from the sun. There. Now then, same color, same color. So we have thalo green, white, black, and now I'm going to add a
little bit of thalo blue. Just to change the flavor
and make it a little darker. A little darker. K, and we'll just fill up the
rest of the sky with that. That easy. And we have a basic idea,
maybe our waterline'll be right along here somewhere. At this point, we're not really concerned. We'll worry about that later. Right now, we're just applying
some color to the canvas. There. See, we already have a masterpiece for the Museum of Modern Art right there. We could stop. (laughs) (splashing) Alright, I just like to wash the brush. (clanking) Ok. (clanking) Now then, let's begin blending, but today I'm gonna blend
a little bit different. Normally I just do a little crisscross. Today I'm gonna touch and push. Just touch it and push. I wanna make this look like there's little rays of light coming out from here without actually having rays of light. I just wanna give that impression, so just by doing this. This is the way that we'll blend it. There. And I'm gonna turn the
brush over occasionally so that I get a little
bit of that color in here. (rough brushing) Alright. And, the least little
bit of titanium white right on that same
brush and begin tapping. There. Just like so, that's all there is to it. (rough brushing) And you can do this
over and over and over, and you will not believe the
effect that you can create. There we go. But all we're doing here
is just tapping, pushing. And I'm doing it quite firmly
as you probably can hear. But you begin seeing that illusion that it's coming out from here. Always start in the light
area and work outward. We don't want to take
that dark, dirty color back into the center. We don't wanna lose that nice bright area. There. K, you beginning to see that? It looks like there's a glow
going all the way around. And as I say, I have some
time restrictions here that you don't have at
home, and you can do this for a long time and you get
it to any degree of softness that you want it. There we go. It will make one of
the most gorgeous skies you've ever seen. And you don't have to
limit it to seascapes. It's also very, very effective and very pretty for landscapes. Lemme just beat the old brush. That just takes off the excess paint. There we go. Somethin about like that. Just keep it going. There. Mmmk. Lemme wash the brush and
we'll start all over again with a little bit of white
into it, just one more time real quickly so you can see
the effect that happens here. (clicks) (clanking) (laughs) That's the brush
that's really fun to do. Go back into a little more
of the titanium white. And I washed the brush
cause I'm gonna start right back here in the
lightest area and work outward. There. (rough tapping) Still doing that tapping and
pushing at the same time. And outward, outward, outward, outward, always blending outward. But isn't that fantastic? And you can do this. It's very, very simple. Very simple. Alright. And right on up here a little bit. In this particular
painting I know basically what's gonna happen since we did it for the opening of the show, so I know there's gonna be some
clouds and stuff in there. We don't have to worry so
much about up in there. There we go. Alright, one more time
we wash the old brush. Actually, I just like to keep
the camera crew on their toes. (clanking) There. Now then, very lightly, very lightly
just blend the entire sky. And that effect will
still remain in there. You can still see that. It looks like light's just exploding. (clanking) There. Something about like that. And you can blend it to
any degree of softness that you want, it's up to you. Little hair right there. Just take the corner of
the brush, lift it off. That's all there is to
it if you get a hair. Cause these are natural bristle brushes, they do have a tendency
to shed a little bit, especially during mating season. But if you happen to get
a little hair, just take the corner of your brush and pop it off. Alright. (clanking) Now, we'll use the same old brush and we'll go right back into
the color that we had there. It's thalo green, a little
black, a little blue, white. Tap a little color right
onto the bristles like that. Something like so. And we'll go right up in here and maybe there's a happy little
cloud lives right there. And all you do is just tap. Just sort of tapping and
givin it a little pushy push. There. Somethin about like that. I had a little cloud. There we go. Maybe, think it was one about here too. Was gonna say this one
won't be an exact duplicate of the one you see at the opening, but it'll give ya an
idea of how it was made. And then you make your own masterpiece, 'bout like so. Little darker color, and
maybe up here at the top you can make out the indication
of a few little clouds, and then way up here. There. Wherever. Now we can wash our brush. And one more time. Nothing else is as good exercise in keeping your brush clean. (clanking) There. Now very lightly, one hair and some air. Ya just blend this. Just blend it and go right across the
entire sky very gently and blend it all together. (clanking) (swiping) There. I beat the brush once again,
only to remove excess paint. It's just it's much faster and easier than going through the whole
cleaning procedure. And it'll clean it pretty well. (clanking) Now, maybe in our world we'll
put a little sun up here. We'll take a little white
paint, a little titanium white. And I don't want this to be real bright, just enough so that you can see it. And then very gently you can blend right over the top of that. And see, now we have a sun,
the indication of some rays coming out, and some happy little clouds. That easy, that easy. Now, major decision. Where's our water line? Let's take, we'll use black, thalo green, little thalo blue, little white. I don't want this water too dark today. Somethin about like that. Not too dark. And big decision time. Maybe our waterline is right along here, right along here. If you have trouble making a waterline that's halfway straight,
which I do frequently. Mine have a tendency to sorta
run to one side or the other. You could put a piece of
masking tape across there before you start painting,
and it'll assure that your waterline, then, is
exactly where you want it. You just pull the masking tape off once you have the sky finished. There. You know it's fatastic. We get hundreds and hundreds
of letters from people all over the country that are painting, and people send me photographs. But recently, right here at the station where it's filmed, they
had a little contest. I wanna show you a picture
that young man did, couple of 'em in fact, named Chris, that lives right here in Muncie, Indiana. Can you believe this? He brought these in, let me look at 'em, cause he won the contest and
you can certainly see why. Chris, you're doin fantastic. But these are the kinda
things that I love to see, because they make it all worthwhile. This young man's probably, oh I dunno, 15 years old or so, and I'm guessing, but he has one heck of a
painting future ahead of him. So congratulations, Chris. There, all I did is just fill
that up with a little color. 'Bout like that. (swiping) And we can wash the 'ol brush again. (splashing water) There. Shake off the excess. (clanking) (laughs) And just beat
the devil out of it. Alright. Let me find a little fan brush. There was some little headlands
back in the background, so I use a little black. A little black, a little bit of the blue, a little thalo green. Same exact colors. We just changed the
proportions a little bit, so it has a little different flavor. Maybe in our world there lives, maybe there's a little,
yup, little headland lives right there. Barely touching the canvas. The more color that you
want, the harder you push. It'll get darker and darker that way. Maybe, yeah, a boat,
little bump right there. It's your world, so you really decide how you want these to look. It's up to you. It's really and truly up to you. Painting is such an individual thing, and that's the way it should be. That's the way it should be. Everybody sees nature
through different eyes, (clanking) and the way you see it is
the way it should be painted. Now just take the big brush and sort of pull that out a little bit, like so. And I have several
little fan brushes going. I get another one here. I'm gonna take a little white, little touch maybe of the thalo green, but mostly white. Here's our light source. All you have to do is just sorta tap. Just tap. This is a very simple way of putting some little highlights back here on these little headlands. There, like that. There we go. You know, I get a lot of letters, also people asking if
there's any possibility of seeing these paintings
that are done on television. And recently the Minnetrista
Cultural Center here in Muncie has started a tour that's
gonna go all over the country, and they have, well in fact they'll have the entire television set. They're gonna have my easel, everything, it'll travel all over the country. And I think there's
about 30 paintings there that come out of the hardcover
book, the original paintings. So if you've ever wanted to see any of these actual
paintings sorta check around and see if it's gonna be in your town. Cause I think you'll enjoy it. They've put a tremendous amount of work into this exhibit, and it's for a good cause. Think you'll really love it. There. But you can actually see
the easel that we use here, and I've even gone
donatin' my dirty ol' shoes that over the years I've
beaten the brush above 'em. The paint sorta falls on
'em and the tops are green. You don't ever get to see that. So, if it comes to your town, (clanking) come out and see us. We'll have people there that are talking and showing ya how to do it. It's just gonna be a good time. Alright. Let's start putting in some little waves and stuff back in here. And today I'm just gonna do waves in a extremely simple way. I'm gonna use a small knife,
pull the paint out flat, got a little thalo green and white here, very little thalo green,
little roll of paint. And now very firmly,
and we wanna literally bend the blade, decide in here where all the little things live. And you can just begin, very firmly, pushing in the indication of little waves that are far, far away, real far away, see there? But it's that easy. There. And this is probably the simplest
type of seascape to make. Even if you've never
painted a seascape before, this one you can do. (tapping) This one you can do. Cause sometimes these capes
give people a little difficulty. This one's easy. (tapping) This one is easy. (scraping) There we go. Few little things here and there. But, see, you just allow the paint to work and create the illusions. Maybe there's another one. I remember right in here somewhere. There. But firm. Really, this is where you take out all your frustrations with the canvas. You get in there and really. Steve, my son, he says moosh it in there. I don't know if that's
really a word or not, but you certainly
understand what he's saying. Just moosh it in there. (scraping) (tapping) And I think there was one
more, maybe, right in here. We had a little boat in there, we'll try to put a
little boat in here too. I like those little devils. Somethin about like so. There. And you can go back and add a
little ripple here and there, whatever you want. Whatever, and wherever. (soft scraping) Alright. Now then, I wanna create
the illusion up here of maybe the sand's a little wet. So we can take a little white paint and just pull it downward like that. Just pull it downward. Grab it, and with a large
brush, pull it and go across. That easy, it'll make
it look like that's wet. Now then, to do our little boat. Easiest way that I've
found, take the knife and begin scraping out
just a little basic idea. That'll help you lay out your
perspective and everything. Just lay it out, shoom, here
it comes right up in here. We have a front, we have
the other side, down, we have a back, then
it'll come back in here. Somethin about like that. Then you can scrape out all this excess. There we go. Tell you what, let's use
a little filbert brush and we'll make a little
brown outta some sap green, some sap green, alizarin
crimson, and about equal parts, and make us a little brown here. There. Maybe a little more green. You can take this to the
green hue, green side, or the reddish side, it's up to you. I usually like it a little
to the reddish side, but it's an individual thing. K, and we wipe off the ol' knife. Now then, take our little filbert brush and we can just begin filling this in. Just begin filling it
in, somethin like so. (rough brushing) There. And here it comes this way. (low breathy whistle) And this is just a very
simple little boat. Maybe the guy parked it here when he ran up on the beach somewhere, who knows. There. Now I'm gonna take a little black and begin filling in
some of the darker areas. There, back in there. Like that. K, maybe a little black and white, make a little greyish color, bring it (low breathy whistle) right along here. It's just so that stands out a little. Maybe a little, oh that's even better. There we go. And then underneath here
a little dark color. (low breathy whistle) Could there be a little
shadow under there. See there, somethin like so. Over here on the other side we need some nice little dark colors too. There, now we get the little liner brush. (water splashing) Dip it in little of the paint thinner, make me a thin brown color. And a little front on the boat right here. (low breathy whistle) Like that. (water splashing) Wash the little brush. And i'm gonna highlight that with a little bit 'a titanium white. Or you could just use liquid white. Doin somethin like so. And back here on the back of the boat. Choom. Maybe there's some, see? There we go. Somethin like so. And you can put in a few
little details here and there. There, it's parked up there on the beach. Was gonna say, maybe
he's out paddlin around and decided ta take a little break, and maybe caught a little fish out there he brought up here to cook. Who knows? Just make up little
stories, it really helps bring everything together. Little liquid white, I'm gonna add some titanium white to it. I just wanna thin the
titanium a little bit. Our little roll of paint still, and we'll put the
indication here that maybe there's a little water
sorta settled around it. Just a little, like so. Shoot, sometimes it's even
nice, maybe a little brown down here in the sand so you can even see the indication that there's
a touch of reflection of the color into the
damp sand underneath. Just a little touch, little touch. There we go. (light scraping) Push very firmly, though. And that'll help give the impression that there's water all around this bottom. Alright. There. (tapping) Sometimes back here we'll play just a little bit, back in these waves. If you take just a little dark color and put it right underneath,
it'll make it look like they're upstanding, or standing up. Least little bit 'a dark
color right underneath, and it gives depth underneath. As I say, I'm gonna keep
this one simple, I promised. But, without getting too crazy, it's little things like
that will just sorta help give the impression that
there's depth under your water. In some of the other series, we've done some seascapes that're,
if you want somethin with the big, crashing
waves, we've really done some that have some nice waves in 'em. There. Now maybe, maybe there's some little sea oats that
live right up in here. So for that, I'm gonna
take a little sap green, little bit of that brownish
color that we made, like so, and I'm just
gonna take a one inch brush and just sorta pop in a little
indication here and there, some little weed, maybe some
over here if I remember too. Somethin like that. Doesn't much matter, however you want 'em. Yeah, we'll push that up like that. MmmK. Then underneath there,
we'll take a little brown, a little white, mix it together. Need some soil for all this to settle, just like so. Little bit 'a dirt under there. There. Somethin like that. So say, if you get a chance
ta watch this little exhibit when it comes to your town, I
really think you'll enjoy it. I really think you're gonna. So proud of it, so many fantastic people have put so much work into it. It's really beautiful. Just taking a little paint thinner, little bit of the brown, to begin. Lifting up a little of this, so we'll make some little sea oat things out there. (splashing) Go into a little bit of the
greenish color here and there. There. And the wind's blowin
up here on the beach. (low breathy whistle) There, maybe there's some,
ooh right over our boat. That's okay, because
that's the way it would be. There. K. Maybe put a yellow ochre, little
white, and paint thinner and we'll put in a few right in here. And some of 'em have little
doers hangin on the end. You just take the little liner brush and just put 'em hanging on there. It's real easy. No problem at all. Alright. Now then, let's take a little white. A little white! Some of that brown color we've
made, a little yellow ochre. I wanna make a nice little color like it. Don't over mix it. See how marbley that is? That's what we're looking for, cause when you cut off
that little roll of paint it'll be right there, in the same way, and how we put it on the canvas, it'll still come out with all those variations that you wanted in there. So that's what we're looking for. I just wanna put the indication of a little light zinging across here. (low breathy whistle) That easy. Barely, barely touching. Just one hair and some air. Just like you puttin
snow on the mountains, that's all we're looking for. That easy. K. And shoot, I wanna take a little more of the greens and the
browns, put the indication that there's a few little weeds up here in the foreground too. Like that. (splashing) Now then, we gotta second left here. I'm gonna take a little bit 'a, I'll just use a little midnight black. On the liner brush, thin the paint 'til it's almost ink consistency. And maybe in our world back here, maybe there's some little birds flyin. These are little M birds,
you just make a little M. Tiny little things that're far, far off in the distance there. Now, the moment of truth. If we bring the camera right up here, let's pull the ol' contact
paper off and take a look see at how well we did today. (tearing) (laughs) Isn't that fantastic? That's one of the most neat
little ideas we've ever come, I think we introduced
the contact paper idea back in the third series. Way back there. And we were cutting out shapes and putting 'em on it
and painting around 'em. Since that time, it has
almost become a standard. People are doing it all over the country, all over the country. We'll take a little red,
little paint thinner. I think this painting is
about ready for a signature. Make your paint very thin. Once again, almost like ink or water. And we'll sign that one
right in the middle, what the heck. Right in the middle. There. Sometimes I get letters, people say, how do ya sign a painting. What name do you use? It's really an individual thing. Some people will use their whole name, 'specially if they've gotta short name. Some people will use initials, and I've even had people
that just use symbols. So it's up to you. You might just wanna
design your own little logo that you put on every painting. But whatever you put on there, it should be special, only for you. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. (70s easy listening music)
