(soft music) - Well, hello. Welcome to the third
Joy of Painting series. I'm Bob Ross, and I'll be your host for the next 13 weeks as we experience this fantastic wet-on-wet
painting technique. In the next few weeks,
we'll show you how to make fantastic pictures here, using only 12 colors, an almighty brush and a great big palette knife. So, I've already covered the canvas with a think layer of Magic White and then we just blend it out with just long horizontal
and vertical strokes like so. This just assures a nice even distribution of Magic White all the
way across the canvas. So, while I'm washing the brush here, I'm going to get them to graphically run the 12 colors that
I use across the screen. These colors will come across your screen in the same order that I have them on the palette, starting
with Titanium White and working around. So, let me clean the brush and we'll get started here. We clean our brushes with
odorless paint thinner. There we go. And just beat the bristles dry. Today let's start out with a tiny little bit of Indian Yellow. And we'll go right in here and just lay on a little bit of color. Just like so. Then we'll go right into
some Alizarin Crimson and pull a little bit of paint out and beat it into your bristles so it's nice and even. We'll put just a tiny bit of Alizarin Crimson here. And we do this making
little criss-cross strokes, or x strokes, just back and forth. There we go. Just let it blend right
down into the yellow. Okay. Now up here on the top, let's go into a tiny bit of Prussian Blue. Now Prussian Blue is very, very strong, be careful with it. And right across the very top, still making the little
criss-cross strokes. We'll just lay in a little
bit of Prussian Blue. And while we have the brush dirty, let's take a little bit of blue and add us a little tiny
bit of water right here. And you pull from the outside in. And leave this area
open, we want it to show when we're finished. There we go. And continually, your color's mixing with the Magic White and it blends it, makes very soft, nice, gentle color. Okay. Now, let's take a clean, dry brush and just blend all this together. Still making the little
criss-cross strokes. And then we'll hypnotize it gently. Down here, all the way across. The yellow will still remain on the canvas and if it happens to touch the blue, it'll just turn green, which
is very nice for water. So we can get away with it today. Okay. Let's start out with a
little bit of Van Dyke Brown. We'll take a small amount of brown and we'll go right up in here and let's put in an almighty mountain. There. Just let this mountain
flow right off your knife. And we're really pushing this paint into the canvas, we want to push it right into the fabric if possible. Maybe another little bump right there. Okay. Now, with a large brush, we can very gently pull
this down a little bit. This removes excess paint
and allows your moutain to get lighter on the bottom. Just pull it down. All we're worried about
is a nice outside edge. We could care less what's
happening inside right now. So, let's take a little
bit of Van Dyke Brown and Burnt Umber mixed together, just mix it right here on the palette. And we just touch, and follow the angles of the mountain. We'll do a nice brown mountain today. There. Just let the paint flow
right off your knife. Right over here, maybe
a little light strikes. And we can take a little bit of white and begin adding to it. To really put some nice little highlights on this mountain. There we go. And this is your world, so let your imagination take you wherever you want to go. Burnt Umber and Van Dyke
Brown just mixed together. Little bit of the highlight color. Now, let's take a little
bit of Van Dyke Brown with a touch of Alizarin Crimson in it. And with that, we'll put some shadows right in here. Just a tiny bit of crimson,
so when we highlight the shadow color, it'll sparkle. A little bit right over in here. Just very basic, quiet little mountains that are way back in the background. Little bit of highlight over here in the shadow. There. Okay, now we can take a clean, dry brush and all we're going to do is begin tapping this bottom at first. Just tap it. And then lift upward. We want to pick up some of the yellow that's underneath here. There we go. Just follow the angles
you have in the mountain. We'll add a tiny bit more of the yellow onto the brush here. Just want this mountain to
softly, softly disappear. Always follow your angles. There. Okay. That's super quick nice little way to make a happy little mountains way back in the distance. Okay. Now, let's take, first of all, clean us off a space so
we have somewhere to work. Put some Sap Green, Prussian Blue and Van Dyke Brown. Just mix all these together,
make a very nice dark color. There we go. Now. Let's take the fan brush
and fill it full of paint. Just pull it through the
paint and fill it up. A lot of paint in the bristles. And we'll use it like so. Just touch and go down. We're going to make some indication of some little evergreens
that are way back in the distance. Far, far away. We don't want much detail back here. They're too far away, we
want to show distance. Just let them work right down, like so. Okay, maybe there's one lives right here. Just wherever you think
there should be a tree, you just drop one in. We're not looking for detail. There we go. Just let these rascals fall in. Now one thing I should mention for the people who are
joining us for the first time, the paint we use is very dry and very firm in comparison
to most oil paints. You need a very firm paint, one of our golden rules here. A thin paint will stick
to the thick paint. So we start with the
thickest possible paint we can find and then we can put layers of thin paint on top of it. Same color, just adding
some ground down here. There we go. Just good dark color. One of the golden rules, you need dark in order to show light. So here we're just
applying our dark color. And watch how easy reflections are. They used to drive me crazy when I was a traditional painter, but watch right up here. All I do is touch and pull down, because the canvas is wet, you can make beautiful, beautiful reflections this simple. Just touching and pulling down. There we go, and then gently go across. Makes it look just like water. And maybe, maybe, maybe, way back in the background back here, maybe there's a little, maybe there's a little waterfall back here that feeds this lake. So touch Titanium White, just touch it and come straight down. And then we want it to splash a little as it hits the water down here, just a little, there we go. Now, let's take a little
bit of Magic White, a little Cad Yellow and maybe some Sap Green. And just load this fan
brush full and we can begin putting some highlights back here. Touch, push that brush so it bends upward. There. And you can make these as bright or as dull as you want them. If you want to show a lot
of sunlight back here, use a lot of the yellow color. If it's a quiet, far away, maybe you want to have it much duller in color. There we go. And maybe there's a little projection that lives right out here, so we just drop it in. It's your projection, you can
put it anywhere you want it. Okay. Maybe, maybe there's
another one over here. It just comes right out like this. Okay. Now we can take and gently
pull a little bit of this down, just so you have a little of
that reflection into the water. Go across. Now, let's take the knife,
little bit of Magic White, pull it out very flat and cut across it, so we can do a very sharp, very small little line back here, just to show the water line. There. There it is. See, I told you that was easy. And this is a very, very
free form of painting. We do no tracings, no drawings, we just sort of let these
flow right out of our heart. Now, maybe as we get a little closer, the evergreens get a little bigger. So, still using the fan brush, I'll go right there.
Evergreen lives there. Corner of the brush, we just begin making a nice little evergreen. Just sort of go back and
forth with your brush, make all the little limbs that hang there. We'll highlight this little tree, so all we're looking for
here is a nice background. And maybe, maybe, maybe there's one right here. You know, trees get lonely too, so they need friends. Let's give him a little
friend right there. Now we can take a little bit of Sap Green and just come back and highlight the tree. You want to place a lot
of emphasis on putting the highlight on the
right side of the tree, since your mountain's
showing that the light's coming from the right. And if you're right-handed,
you'll find it's usually easier to highlight things on the right. If you're left-handed, it'll sort of vary from person to person. Left-handed people have been forced all their life to do right-handed things, so they will find through experimenting which way is easier for them. Okay, now maybe on this side over here, maybe we've got an almighty tree. Maybe there's a nice big evergreen that lives right there. We just start right at the top, using very little pressure. As we work down this tree, we're using more pressure and making the brush bend downward. There we go. Isn't that a super way to
make a little evergreen? I used to agonize over these. So this really is the way to do it. Just back and forth, let the brush work, let the paint work. There we go. And we have a happy
little tree that quick. And maybe we want to have some leaf trees, some big trees here. So let's use the big brush. Fill it up full of paint, just load a lot of paint into it and figure out where you want a tree and go right up in here
and just drop it in. Bend the bristles, make that brush bend, make it work for you. And just come right on, maybe there's a little peninsula
right out through here. So just drop it in. There we go. Now, while we got the dirty brush up here, let's put a few little
reflections, right there, just let them fall in, pull straight down and go gently across. When you're doing these reflections, be sure you pull them straight down. If you pull them at an angle, they just won't look right. So now, let's take a one inch brush here, we'll put a little
Magic White in the brush to thin the paint and
load it full of paint. Here I'm going to load
it with some Cad Yellow and let's go back into the Sap Green. Cad Yellow and Sap Green and a little Magic White to thin it. Lot of paint in the bristles. Now, touch, push, bend the brush. You need to bend it to make all these beautiful little leaves here. Let it bend and then sort of work in patterns so the tree
has some shape to it. You just don't want a
dead tree laying out here, let's put some life in him. There. Now I'm beginning to go
into a little Yellow Ochre. And we'll drop right down here, there's another happy little bush. There they are. Sometimes you can add just a tiny bit of paint thinner, to thin your paint. There and that doesn't dilute the color. Maybe there's another little bush that lives in front of that. Layer your bushes, it gives depth to your painting. Okay, there we are. Now, this sort of reminds me of my home in Alaska, because you have so many
beautiful, beautiful mountains and water things here. So, let's put a happy
little cabin in here. This is just too pretty of a spot not to have a cabin. So we'll just take a little Van Dyke Brown and we'll do the back
eave of the cabin first. There it is. And we'll come in here
and put in the other side of the cabin. Just drop him in. In this series, we're
going to try to show you quite a few buildings and how to do it. We've had so many requests from our first couple of series people wanting to do buildings. We're really going to try to do some in this series. Okay, a little side over here. We've already got the makings
of a little cabin there. Take a little brown, white,
little touch of Umber into it. There we go. Now maybe we'll just
put a little indication of some logs here, We'll make this a little log cabin. And at home, where you
have unlimited time, you can put a lot more detail into it. Here, if we go over 30
minutes, they yell a lot at us. There we go. Now maybe these logs go in this direction. Just want to show you how to do it. As I say, at home you have unlimited time and you can put a
tremendous amount of detail into these paintings. Now on this side, we want
it to be a little darker. So here we just, just want
a little indication showing. And if you had a little cabin, you'd need a little door to get in it. So we'll put a little door right there. It's just straight brown
and we'll cut it off so it fits the cabin. Maybe there's a little window right here. Here I'm using the
little edge of the knife. Maybe there's a little window right there. Your cabin, so you put
windows wherever you want. And now, let's put some land under here. Need something to hold all this up. There we go. Straight Van Dyke Brown again. Just let the land come out like there. And with a large brush,
you can touch and pull just a tiny bit of that
down into the reflection. Very lightly go across. Now we'll highlight this with a little bit of brown and white. Just so it stands out. There. Isn't that fantastic? Now we'll take a little bit
of the dark Van Dyke Brown and just put some logs
over here on the edge, you can see the ends of them. Like so. You go back over here, there we are. Maybe there's a little color in the roof. I'm going to add just a
tiny bit of Permanent Red to some brown. And we'll put a tiny little bit of color up here in the roof. And a little bit over on this edge. There. Makes that roof stand out a little bit, a little so you can see it better. Let's go back to the fan brush here. We'll get right into our Yellow Ochre and Sap Green and a little Cad Yellow and let's just push in
some little grassy areas. He keeps his yard mowed nice so we got some nice little
grassy areas going here. All right. Now, back to the Magic White. This is a very thin paint, it's almost like water, it's a liquid. And into that, I'll put
a little bit of brown. Just to make it look like sand. And we'll go right up through here and let's begin putting in, maybe a little sandbar right here. There. Just let it flow off your knife. Now we can go right back into here and get some Van Dyke
Brown and let's just start, let's go all the way over here, what the devil? We can do anything. Just let that dirt flow
right off your knife. This is brown with a
little bit of Umber in it. Van Dyke Brown. Van Dyke's a very nice chocolate brown. Beautiful color. One of my favorite colors. Okay, we put the dirt in first then we can come back and
highlight this a little with some grassy areas. Just touch, let the grass
grow slightly above here. There. Sort of bring all this together. Now you know, if you had
a little cabin like this, you'd have to have a way to get to it. So let's have a little walkway, maybe it starts back here and just comes around like so, right out toward the front. Little bit of brown
and white, touch of red to highlight it a little. There, there we go. Now we got us a little trail,
so we can get back in there. Now let's take and begin
to laying a little tiny bit of grass here that grows down from his walk, down to the water. See how much distance that creates? It pushes everything back. Maybe right in here. Just like so. There we go. Now maybe, maybe when the old fellow built this cabin, maybe he was having a good day and he put in a little porch out here. Let's put a little porch on the cabin. There. I'm using the little
edge of the knife again. Then we can come, wait, needs a... there! One little post to hold the porch up and a tiny bit of
highlight right out here. There we go. Got it. Maybe a little highlight out here on this post there, just a tiny bit. Now with our fan brush, we can bring all this together. Just like that. Okay, now I'm going to
use just a clean knife and cut a few little sticks and twigs here and there. Need some sticks to hold up all these beautiful little bushes that you've done. There. Now let's take some more Sap Green on the fan brush and let's highlight these
big, almighty trees here. Once again, you want the most emphasis on the right side of the tree, since your light's coming
from that direction. There. And as it goes down the
tree, let it get darker. Start at the top, as you work down, automatically your brush
is going to pick up the dark color underneath. It'll get darker as it works downward. There we go. Now. Maybe, maybe we'll just take and let's put a little bit of highlight around the door, so that stands out. A little bit around the window and that'll sort of square it up a little. Little bit over here,
maybe, just an indication. This side's very, very dark, you don't see as much there. Okay, let's take, let's
take a one inch brush, and I'm going to take
and put a little thinner in my brush. A tiny bit of paint thinner, so it'll thin the paint out a little. And go right into the Van Dyke Brown and load a lot of paint into the brush, just really fill it up. Load it full. And then we'll go over into the white and pull just one side
of it into the white. So now we've got brown on one side white on the other. There we go. This is just double-loading a brush so you can get a fantastic
effect in one stroke. Remember to put the
lighter side on the right, and maybe we'll have, maybe there's a huge tree, big pine tree lives right there. Just come straight down the canvas whoo, right through the cabin. Putting some little foots out here and we can darken it up
a little if you'd like. Just come right straight down. And that's the way you
make an almighty tree. And add a little bit
more brown on this side, I want to darken this
side a little bit more. And then we can work here. Little fixes, little foots up, Okay, now let's take
another one inch brush and go right into the Sap Green, get a lot of Sap Green
on here, dark color. Very dark. And once again, I've added a tiny, tiny bit of paint thinner to it, just to thin it down a little. Lot of paint in the bristles, though, lot of paint. Okay, let's go right up here and put some nice little leaves on this great big tree. Just use this corner of the brush and all we're doing is just tapping. Just touching. Just let those leaves
fall right off your brush. Putting a large tree in
the foreground like this, it helps push everything back and makes the perspective better. Makes your painting more interesting. Maybe there's a little limb
that comes right there. Okay. Now, we can go right into a little bit of Cad Yellow and a touch of Sap Green. We'll make a highlight color to drop on this tree. And we just come right
here, and once again, you want more emphasis on the right than the left. Juts put some highlights on all those beautiful little leaves that you made. There we go. Okay, a little highlight right here. Like so. And if you wanted to, you could take your liner brush with a little thinner on it, just to thin the paint down and just put the indication here and there maybe of a little limb that you
can see a little bit of back in here. Just here and there. Like so. Maybe there's some nice little sticks that live out here that are growing, some little twigs. There. Okay. Now back to our fan brush and we go back into this yellow and green and a little bit of Yellow Ochre. And let's work on this foots down here, we'll just put some grass right down here and cut the tree off wherever we want it. It's your tree, you can
cut him anywhere you want. And maybe there's a few little sticks that hang out over the
bank, just here and there. And I'm just using the
point of the knife here. Okay. Well, I think we about have
this painting ready to sign. So let's take a little
bit of paint thinner, or you can use a thin oil if you'd like, a thin oil probably works
a little bit better, works a little smoother. Little paint thinner and
we're going to mix this until it's like water. Very, very loose. Thin. Turn this fan brush, or
this liner brush, I'm sorry. You caught me. Turn this liner brush to bring
it to a nice sharp point. And let's go right up in here and sign. The paint's very, very
thin, almost like water. And with that, you can
literally just write your name. R. O. S. S. That's what it is. There we go. Next week, we hope you're here with us, have a big glass of iced tea ready, got your canvas set up. We're going to do a black canvas, we'll do a happy little
seascape and show you how to very simply do a seascape that's effective, lot of fun. And we'll be looking
forward to seeing you. Until next time, we'd like
to wish you happy painting. God bless. (soft music)
