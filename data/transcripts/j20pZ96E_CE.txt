hi welcome back I'm glad you could join me there you ready to do a fantastic little painting good tell you what let's start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let's look up here I have my standard Oh pre-stretch canvas I paired it's all covered with a nice even coat of liquid white and it's ready to go so let's go thought today we did a little animated opening that's the one you see at the beginning of each show of this series that just sort of it just sort of pops in with the music that's a beautiful little painting it only takes a couple of minutes to paint it but it takes a lot of fantastic people a long time to to animate it so let's do that one I'll start today with a with a small amount of phthalo blue on the two-inch brush just a little bit of blue just tap it and we will reach over here and get the least little touch of phthalo green leaves little touch very strong and we'll go up here and let's just bounce in some just some happy little areas up here in the sky Salo blue pale green now this won't be an exact duplicate of what you see at the beginning of each show it'll give you an idea of how it was painted it's almost impossible to paint an exact duplicate and we never try to paint exact duplicates okay maybe over here we'll put a little bit more wherever you want it nice dropping some happy little colors then I'm bounce around and play there now the color is continually mixing with a liquid white and you get all these different values and shades let the liquid white work for you this is a lazy man's way of painting it's why I like it so much basically a very lazy person there and then we have a little water in that painting so while I have this on the brush tell you hardwood this mix a little more color right on the brush and let's go down here and just put in a little bit of water pull from the outside in outside in like so see about mixing those colors on the brush you get all kinds of different colors that are happening there and from the other side we're still pulling from the outside in and I'm leaving a little area open here if everything works out just right that'll look like a little sheen of light coming across the water now just barely touch anything go all the way across and bring everything together and that little white area remains there and then we can very gently just blend the corners of this out the edges out there don't want to over blame this I want to leave it sort of rough and ragged right now that's what my dog says ruff that's what he said he set down the sandpaper rough there okay and then let's wash your brush we just wash it as usual and odourless thinner shake off the excess and just cover the whole studio hey listen let's put some big clouds where we just use a two inch brush - you could do this with a fan brush or one-inch brush just pull it through a straight titanium white a lot of Payton bristles okay let's go through and put a similar cloud maybe their lives a little cloud right there I just use tiny little circular strokes they sort of mix it up why into depth there Kimi and it'll cloud lives yep there he is there he is son again just floats rendering his fun all day and try not to stay in one area and keep keep working it it'll just turn into a great big cotton ball in the sky keep your brush moving don't don't try to work on the same area over and over and over you'll be much happier with your clouds if they're loose and free but there may be some thread in here wherever you want to just sort of make a big decision where clouds live in your world and drop them in there we go see there but you can make a sky full of clouds in just a few minutes doesn't take long these old big brushes will do fantastic things for you there maybe it is another one right there and the paint's quite thick here in order in order to do all this blending without it just mixing together you need a very firm and dry thick paint I can't say that enough I know you hear me say it over and over and chill after show but it's most most important if you're going to get the best results a thick paint is an absolute necessity never wash the brush again take a no then nice dry brush and I just want to blend this very gently just blend it just sort of stirring it up and I'm not touching the top much at all trying to avoid touching the top of each cloud mostly the bottom but every once while you can just beat the brush little that'll take off the excess paint without going through the whole cleaning procedure yet there and at this point don't expect your cloud to look like it's finished should still look a little rough we're going to blend the chip it's just this just blends that bottoms out get some ready for the next step knock off the excess now we're going to fluff these up just very gently very gently barely touching the candles grab these little son of a guns and just lift them up that's all there is to it lift up lift up let them get fluffy so you've got a difference that makes their once while knock off any excess paint continue to fluff work in layers they're now very lightly - hairs and some air all we're gonna do is just gently gently gently there's a hair on the canvas all you do is take a corner to brush and lift it off there very lightly just enough to take out the brush marks and that easy you got a fantastic little sky okay now then today today we're going to make some little foothills back here and so for that I'm going to take some blue and a little bit of white a little touch up a little touch of midnight black into it so we get some phthalo blue midnight black a little touch of white looks like it might be a little touch a phthalo green there - that was an accident but it's fine and we'll put the least little touch of crimson in there okay makes a nice color now let me clean the knife today we'll use an oval brush and it's easy to to identify it has a black handle the rest of my brushes have white this one has some black hand law okay now decide where your little foothills are gonna live out here just touch with this brush and pull down it's sort of round on the end I see so it it makes these nice little round areas we're looking for very easily there we go okay and maybe this little footy Hill this goes right down my cat however you want it just pull it straight down it would take a clean two-inch brush and I want to create a misty area in here sod this tap all we do is just tap and then lift slightly upward see how soft the base of that becomes okay then we'll use the same color the blue little black I want the same color only darker less white and at this time because this one's gonna be closer to us a little touch of the crimson there just load the brush BA back and forth and maybe there's another little foothill and it came right down my cat now you can also turn this brush this way and make more individualistic little things and pull up straight down it's very lightly see this darker color now separates there we go just like so like this just work its way right on out here and there some more individual things I'll turn the brush vertically and we can go back to our big brush and tap the basin tap it firmly probably hear how hard I'm hitting this but I'm using only the top corners brush is happy want to create that illusion of missed again now sometimes on foothills maybe you want to show a little bit of color a little bit of highlight so let's do that today shoot we got to get it going here I'm going to take that same over brush and go into little yellow CAD yellow blue yellow ochre and just sort of work it around like that that's all we need okay a little bit of color on there then all we had to do is just sort of tap just tap and give it a least little downward pull I just want to put the indication here and there's a little bit of highlight not much not much there and we'll come back and soften that with a big brush too but that's the way you make trees that look a little closer to you just by putting a little color when things are far far away from you they look sort of bluish color as they get closer then you're able to make out detail in color and all those wonderful things so in a faraway they should look just blueish like Abba and that helps create the illusion of distance in your painting cable yellow ochre and then a little touch of Indian yellow just break it up there we go back to our big brush we can just tap the base of this a little just to soften it and bring it all together there okay then lift upward and that little oval brush super make some fantastic effects let's go on the other side here we'll use some more blue and some black I want this to be even darker even darker okay maybe over here lives another little foothill I think in that little opening at the beginning it had several layers of foothills and this is the way they're made so each layer gets darker now maybe before we get too far here let's put some that puts reflections back here watch here grab this and pull it down and we'll have a little bit of water back here in that background just touch and pull down so straight down then come across that will give the illusion of water and we can take a little touch of white paint and well just make the indication here and push it upward just some little water lines some little things see makes it look like yes there just by grabbing it pushing upward sneaky huh lay it on grab it just let it go upward and it's all there is to it okay now then we'll bring this this foothill forehead on down here in front of it maybe it comes right on out here and add we see there's a little recessed area that's place the big trail could go back here and hide there and maybe on that indications here and there a little bit of highlight on it it's also quite close so if you can see highlight over here chances are you could see it here - just a little see luckily in this painting I know pretty much is what's going to happen since we animated it so I know what areas are going to be covered up I don't have to worry about put the whole bunch of stuff here most the time we just we're just about halfway making these things up as we go I have a general idea but that's about all that where you're flexing is gonna be and you can pull that down tap it lift it upward bring it all together reflection there and very lightly across and we can do that same thing again with a little touch of white paint this is not liquid white usually on the water lines I use the liquid white this is just plain white then I'm lifting it upward there okay I grab an old fan brush here there we go over here on this side let's have some fun let's have some fun I won't take yellow ochre a little bit of a little bit of dark Sienna in it on the fan brush but almost be right back right back there I am there we go the yellow ochre dark sienna mixed together now up in here we had a little little tree or two yeah that was just mostly yellow ochre with a little Sienna in it and I want these trees today to be like little swamp trees once it the limbs hang down they're tired when you've had a rough life out there in the swamp let's see maybe there was another one and he lived you right there but sort of push those limbs down that I'm hanging these old trees they have a lot of hangy downs on them and you could just take the brush and just wiggle it upward create the illusion of some little bushes and stuff it lived back in here mm-hmm I don't talk to that or in front of that we'll begin putting some other things from clean my brush and come back in here and let's see here we'll take some Prussian blue midnight like the muzzle makes a pretty good path we're gonna use that some Van Dyck Brown crimson to throw some SAP green there too whatever you get mainly dark you're looking for a nice dark color let me wipe off the knife we just wipe off the knife on old paper towel now then we'll load the fan brush full of color both sides a lot of color and let's decide here where some trees lift maybe there's one right here and once again we're looking for these old hanging down limbs just let them hang down I can't turn in the brush these are old targets there give him a friend I can't and maybe into your painting you won't trees it so maybe here a little better off in mind you can do that I just want to show you how to make these all I call them small pines because usually which is very wet you have evergreen trees that where I come from in Alaska you have evergreen trees that the limbs hang we down and the father South you go in Alaska the more of these limbs just hang there beautiful but usually it's where it's a very damp but now if you want nice straight ones and yours please do that there we go singing that quick we've got some happy little trees I'll just take the big brush up little ones too slow and let's put some land in here thinking all we're doing is just having and we don't care some of these little hanging downs off the brush get down here because we'll just turn those into reflections will use them Rascals and that's our land area for that side and while we have it brush going just grab and pull down a little string F then come across they're instant reflections again and then back to our same old fan brush and we can just go right into a little touch of the CAD yellow and it's immediately immediately it's going to turn green because of the blue I just want to put the indication here and there of a highlight or two I don't want too much over here not too much all right okay now then we can take a one inch brush put a touch of the liquid white with it just to thin the paint a little then paint will stick to a thick paint and we go right in some yellow and some yellow oka okay yellow ocher little touch of the bright red let's go up here and begin putting in all kinds of little little grassy things and just using the corner of the brush and just tapping just tapping it's most important the angles that you follow here we want to create the lay of the land of the land to sort of move over this way there we go see there okay maybe there's a little bump it depends right here wherever you want it just drop him in back here but leave some of those little darkest areas in between that's what gives depth and distance can't take a little touch of the van Dyck Brown and let's just put in a little little dirt under here and just rubbing that just rub it a little bit Brown right in there like so there we are back to our titanium white got that little roll of paint on the knife and it's just trying to lay a little bit of white right underneath there for a little waterline not I'm doing is touching you allowing the canvas I love what it wants give you back what's left there hmm and we can take the line scratching a few sticks and twigs wherever you wherever you I don't think we back get that side finish let's go to the side let me grab I have several oval pressures going here we just grabbed it I like his oval brushes they're fun okay let's come right up in here load the brush full of paint and there was an evergreen tree who lived he lived he did live right there just start out by making a sort of a little center line and you can take this brush just sort of work it back and forth we want these we want these old limbs just to hang on this tree this oval brush does that very nicely Auto hanging down Lamson there we go nice old tree okay and he's got a friend lives right next door friend lives right there and same thing they're he's to a good buddies they live next door to each other and maybe here and there there's a happy little Bush who saw the crows right down by his foots this sort of make up little ideas and do him and we had one big monster tree big guy he lives right there that's a big son of a gun there and come right along in here right over all that sky load the brush frequently as required whenever you start running out of paint just load it back up see that oval brush makes all those little doers happen there I don't don't know what kind of name you put on those doers that sounds good there we go but that easy you could make a fantastic tree just let him grow right out of the brush there we go okay going back to my big brush here let's just fellow this yep I mean come right down here and just begin putting it all kenza this is just dark color so our lights will show on our lights to show and you could really put all this on with a paint roller doesn't matter we had a little path there so we can sort of leave that open hmm we go back to our oval brush it has the light green on it put some color on it and let's come back up in here just indicate a few little highlights on these evergreen trees just a few here and there there don't cover for you last darks why this does look like an old swampy area okay go back to my one inch brush let's put some highlights on the little individual bushes yes I drop tums in wherever you think they should be maybe let's go right over here and work from the one that's farthest away forward always coming forward forward forward forward before we get too far along there we need to stop put in our little path so we can have some of the bushes and stuff hang over the path so we'll take the knife titanium white just pull it out very flat okay let's go ahead up here just this is just white I like it's bright in here it really makes everything shine stands out there hmm and till then I will add the least least little touch of dark sienna there just the least little touch just enough to color it a little okay and then we can go back to our one-inch brush and with that we can begin completing the rest of these little bushes and let some of these little bushes hang over the path that pushes a path down into the painting so it fits don't want it to look like it's floating around and just having a good time push that rascal down in there there's another one see and that pushes that path right on back now we don't know where it goes and we don't care it goes back there to it to a happy place wherever that is and then individual bushes it's most important when you're up in the foreground I guess to do one bush at a time so that each one's an individual has its own personality you'd give them names and people think you're crazy but that's sorry that's sorry long as you happy doesn't matter there's one it's got a little little red flowers out on the end of it one them happy accidents there just like so okay now we can take her a little script liner brush thinner on it go right into the Van Dyck Brown and maybe tell you what maybe there's a little stick it is right there something like so say there and add a few little details and yours and yours should also be finished and I think with that we'll call this painting complete I hope you've enjoyed seeing how the animated opening was made and until next time from all of us here happy painting and God bless you
