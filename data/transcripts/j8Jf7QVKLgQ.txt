- Welcome back, I'm glad to see you today. I thought today we'd do a
fantastic little painting that's a lot of fun. I think you'll enjoy it. And let's start off and have them graphically run all the
colors across the screen that you need to do the painting that I'm gonna do up here today, and they'll come across your screen starting with the Titanium White and working around in the same order that I have them on my pallet. Now, if you already have a
way to set your pallet up, don't change it just because I have mine, but try to set your pallet
up the same way each time so you don't have to, you don't have to waste a lot
of time looking for color. You always know where it's at. So let's get started. I've already covered the canvas With a thin, even coat of Magic White. It's wet, slick, and ready to go. Start with a little bit of prussian blue, and I'm just gonna work
that into the brush and maybe today, maybe we'll make some, some little streaky clouds. And I'm gonna just start just making little criss-cross strokes, sort of like that. And we'll just let them go back. Now, I want them to be darker up here than back here, so start at the top and work downward. And maybe, maybe there's one right there. And I'm just sort of going back and forth. Keep it a little bit darker in color than you want it to be
when you're finished, because we're gonna blend a lot, and it will lighten in value. And maybe there's another one wherever. Wherever, just drop them in. I think we'll do a
little farm scene today. We film in Indiana, which is a beautiful, beautiful state and has a lot of farms. So maybe we'll do a
happy little farm scene. Okay, now we've got the
color on the canvas. Little darker right there. There, okay now I'm gonna wash my brush. And once again, we wash our brushes with odorless thinner, paint thinner. Shake off the excess. (chuckles) And then just
beat the devil out of them. Now then, I'm gonna go
right into titanium white. Titanium white, I'll tell you what. Let's put the least, least
little touch of permanent red into it, just so it has
a slight pinkish glow. Load that brush full of paint. Okay, let's go up to the canvas here, and in between these areas now, I'm gonna begin just doing
this with a little color. So it overlaps the dark. Okay, a little more of the color. Maybe there's a little in here. Like so. Little right in there, maybe. Not a whole bunch. Okay now, I'm gonna begin
blending all this together. Just like that. Just blend it together. Make all kinds of beautiful
little things happen. Maybe there's a little white right there. Wherever you want it. You can even take your brush and put a few little swirly
patterns here and there, just to separate things, blend it out. Skies, oh there's as
many, many different skies as there are people to look
at them and paint them. There's really no absolute
set way to make a sky. There we go. All kinds of little things happening. Maybe we'll put a little
white right up in here. There we go. Now, we'll just blend
out the brush strokes, and it gives us a very
quick, simple little sky. Easy to do, and very effective. Okay, I'll clean that
old brush one more time and we can get started. Now, if we're gonna do an old barn, maybe we'll have a... Maybe we'll do a couple
of buildings today. Buildings are always a lot of fun, and they bring a lot of joy to your heart. Let's start out, maybe we'll do a, maybe there's a small building back here. And we'll start with some van dyke brown. A little roll of paint on the
knife, and let's go up here. Maybe there's a happy
little building right here, a little shed or something. We'll put it in first,
then we'll come back and do a big old barn. One of my best friends
was telling me about a saying they have here in Indiana. They talk bout the barn built the house, and I didn't understand that at first. You can look at the size
of the house and the barn, and see how well the old farmer's doing. If he's doing real well, then he's got a big barn and a big house. Okay, now we need some... We'll put a front on that old building. This is just van dyke brown. All you're doing is just
laying in base color right now. You could really care less. This is strictly,
strictly just base color, and then we'll come back
and begin adding detail. Okay, now then we've got
to make some big decisions. Some big decisions. Take van dyke brown, I'm gonna put some permanent red into it. Like so. And just blend that together. Now, cut across it, and
let's go right up here. And we'll just put, this is old wood. I like old wood. Very rarely do I paint new buildings. I like old buildings. Now, this is where you begin making all those decisions and
bringing all this together. And you also have to decide
where's your light coming from? Where is your light
coming from in your world? Maybe today we'll have
it coming from the left. So the front of the buildings will be lit. So I'm gonna take the same
color add a little white to it, maybe a little bit of yellow ochre. So now we've got van dyke brown, a little yellow ochre, a little white and a little permanent red. Let's go back up here. Now, touch very lightly. Very lightly. Oh, very lightly, just
barely caressing the canvas. And that's enough. That's enough. Now I'm gonna take some blue, prussian blue and van dyke brown. Mix those together and
make a very dark color. Should look black. And right under this eve here, I want a little bit of dark. And under this eve a little dark, and just barely lay this on, like so. And I'll just take a clean knife and touch that, and lightly pull down. And it creates a shadow
under these overhangs. That easy. Okay, now we need some roof up here. And we'll use van dyke
brown, permanent red. Let's go right up here. And we will just start over in that eve. And maybe come over on this eve. Just sort of outline it a little bit. Okay, now all I'm gonna do
here is just sort of touch, just let the paint be
pulled off onto the canvas. Canvas will pull off what it wants, give you back what's left. There we go, old old roof. There are shingles missing
and shingles broke. It's like me, it's had a hard life. There, okay. Now we need a door on this building. There we go, just come
across, maybe it's like that. This is just the dark color. We don't care what color
it is as long as it's dark. Maybe, maybe this building was, maybe it was made out of boards. So I'll just take a small amount of white, cut across it, and we'll
put some indication of some little boards here and there. This is your building, so you
have to make these decisions. And just a few little
indications over here. I don't want too many over here. Just like so. And a little bit around the door, where the light's striking,
make it stand out. That simple. We got a happy little building. Now then, I'm gonna mix up van dyke brown, permanent red, and prussian blue, and we'll just mix them all together here. And we're gonna use quite a bit of this, so I'll mix up a pretty good sized pile. There we go. Just like that. Alright. And I wipe my knife here
on just paper towels or a clean rag, whatever you have. And we'll take this old brush, and we'll begin dropping in what'll end up being some
nice little grassy areas. Maybe they're not taking too
good care of this old barn. It's an old barn. The weeds are beginning to
sneak in there and take it. There we go. All we're doing is just
dropping in some dark color so our lights will show when we come back and put light color in there. And that mixes with the magic white and automatically gets lighter in value. Okay. Now, a lot of times as I
drive around here in Indiana, I see old barns and the have, I don't really know what they are. But they have sticks, or poles that sort of project up. Maybe there's one in right there. This is where they hook their antenna so they can pick up our show. (chuckles) Little bit of highlight. Now, we said the light
was coming from the left, so it'll be on that side. There we go. And that's just a little brown and white. Put the least little bit right there. Like that. Okay, and let's have a big old barn. Now, a lot of times it really helps if you come up here and you sort of scrape out a basic shape. Maybe the old barn, top of it's here and it comes down. It's got a bend, here it
bends, and it comes over here. This is a super easy way to
lay out your basic shape. It also will help you to remove this excess paint. Especially if that paint is thin, because we're gonna put a thick color over the top of it. Tell you what, let's get crazy. Maybe it comes over here, then it comes right in front
of that one a little bit. That'll help push that one back. Alright, what color do we want the roof? Let's use some brown, and some white. And we'll put a little
bit of blue into that. And we'll lighten that down
into a couple of values. There we go, very nice. Let's go up here. Let's start up here on the roof. Now, when you're doing buildings, when you're looking at a 3/4 view, and it's a 3/4 view if
you can see the front and the side of the building. That's a 3/4 view. One of the big things to remember, the back of this building has to be a little tiny bit lower than the front. That's so, so important. So important, and it's one of the easiest things to overlook. Try to remember that. People will look at your painting and they might not
understand what's wrong. But they'll say, "Somethings
wrong with that painting." And they may not understand what, but their mind will tell them
something's wrong with it. And that's usually all it
is, is that little angle. And it's such a simple little thing that we have a tendency
to overlook it sometimes. Okay, now right here it bends. Big old bend in the roof,
and it comes down like that. Just let it go down. Angles are very, very important. There we go. Just like so. Okay now then, let's pick up some of this brown that we've made. This is van dyke brown, permanent
red, little prussian blue. And let's begin putting in some overhangs. Barns need overhangs too. There. See, that's so the cow
has a place to stand while it's raining so he won't get wet. There we go. Bring this right on down. And here once again, all we're doing now is just laying in dark color. You need the dark in order
for the light to show. You need the dark. Painting is a great deal like life. You need a little dark in your life so that you know when
he good stuff happens. There. Now, we've all had that, and we'll all continue to have that. That's what makes it all worthwhile. And the very fact that you're aware of it is enough reason to be overjoyed that your'e alive and can experience it. Just think, if you were a stone you'd never get to enjoy anything. We are so fortunate. There, well, we are building
us a fantastic barn here. Big old barn. There. Now, we need to put some
highlights on this barn. Permanent red. Permanent red and bring it
into some van dyke brown. We'll make this a nice
reddish color brown. We'll do a red looking barn here. Touch, very lightly. Very lightly. Caress the canvas. Caress it. There we go. Just caress it. Okay now, over here this
sides gonna be darker. So we can use the same color
and add more brown to it. Brown is your duller. It makes colors much duller. Okay, now then. Touch, and just pull down. Let the paint break. Just let it break. Look there, it looks
like old wood already, and you haven't hardly done a thing. It's unbelievable what you can do. Now then, just like in the
other one we need some shadows. So I'll use a little bit of this dark. That was prussian blue and van dyke brown. Just like so. Just lay it on first. Let me mix up a little more. Prussian blue and van dyke brown. And right under this overhang
here, we need that dark. It sort of sets everything off and makes it look so much better. Now, clean my knife, touch. Just pull it down a little bit. You don't wanna kill it all. There. Now maybe, maybe, maybe maybe there's right across here, we'll touch again with the dark color, and I'm gonna grab that and pull down. Just pull it straight down so it looks like there's a division there. Now, we'll go right into a
little bit of light color. And we'll put some happy
little boards right in there, and all I'm doing is just
cutting right though. Little bit of color on the knife, just to give indication
of some old barn boards. If you can find an old
barn in your neighborhood that the farmer doesn't want anymore, these old boards make some of the most beautiful, beautiful picture
frames you've ever seen. Try it, and they're easy to make. Okay, now we need, we need a place up here so the, the old farmer can pull
his hay up in there. Okay, and right here
we'll have a big door. And this is just blue and brown. Just a dark color. Big door. Big door. And then around the edge of the door, a little bit of light strikes. Makes that door stand out. And we'll put a little bit
right around here, too. Just to make it stand out a little. Okay, we'll have some little
indication of some boards here. We don't want it to be left out. There we go, just drop them in. There. Now, if this doesn't stand apart enough, take a little dark color because there needs to be a division between the front and the side. Take a little dark color and put in there. There, and that'll help separate it. Just like so. Okay, I think we're ready
to play a little more now. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe we'll put some nice little grassy areas right along here. And I'm just tapping this
with this 2 1/2 inch brush. And this is where you straighten
out the bottom of your barn and decide where everything's gonna be. There we go. Just let it go. And really, you could put
this on with a paint roller. It really makes no difference. All we're doing here is
just applying dark color. There. Just need some dark color. Heck, we'll just go into some sap green. Just add a little sap green into that. Even a touch of crimson, alizarin crimson. Because when you put sap green and alizarin crimson together,
it makes a beautiful, beautiful rich brown color. So we're still working in brown tones, but by mixing on the
brush and on the canvas, we're gonna have some nice effects here when we get done. Alright. Now, no farm's complete
without some fences. So, let's build some fences. We'll start with some of this brown color made form the permanent red, the van dyke brown and our prussian blue. Prussian blue, it's almost a
tendency to say Persian blue, but that was my kitty cat. Okay, put a little fence right here. Maybe there's one here. I'll tell you what I wanna do. I wanna put a little grass back
there before I do all that. So we'll take a little
yellow, a little sap green, because if I put that fence in first, then it's gonna be hard to sneak that grassy area back in there. Now I'm just using a little
indian yellow, yellow ochre, just mix them on the brush. Let all these little colors happen. Not too much color in between. There's a big shadow in there. Just little indication of some color. There we go, out here. Look at that. Look at that. Right along the barn here, a few little weeds are beginning to grow up the side. He's like me, he don't
cut his lawn enough. And I'm the world's worst lawn keeper. I'm ashamed to tell you that. Okay, a little bit of the
happy little grassy areas right out through here. And wherever, wherever. There we go. Now, you don't wanna kill all this dark. Because there's probably been a lot cows and horses walking around here, and they sort of tromped all this down. There's a lot of dead grass in here. If you were stepped on by a horse you'd be brown too. Because they hurt. When I was a little boy, I had a horse step on my foot one time and oh, you don't realize how much they weigh until they step on you. Okay, now we can put our fence in. There it comes, maybe here, and let's play some games today. Maybe this fence goes
up there and then over. I'm just doing this so you can see how you make a fence move all around. (humming) Be brave, be brave. Drop them in. Drop them in. Maybe it comes right down like that. Okay, let's put one more
little one right there so it goes around so it goes
around on the other side. Now, we need to highlight these, so I'll take some white and
a little bit of light brown, and all I'm gonna do is just touch. Just touch so you have a
little bit of highlight on these posts. (humming) There we are. Now, we need some rails. We wanna just use the
same old brown color, and all I'm gonna do is just touch. And this old farmer, he's like me. He just picked up whatever
happened to be laying around. And he made him a fence out of it. Now, here we want it to go uphill. See? Bloop, bloop. See how you can bend fences
right around your painting? And fences help add a lot of depth and a lot of perspective to your painting. Use them. And they're fun, they're
easy, and of course we're not interested in those happy bucks, but if you ever wanna sell a painting, fence adds a lot of interest. Okay, maybe, maybe. Tell you what, maybe there was a little fence right over here. Just a quick little indication like that. And in here, I'm just gonna rub. Just let that color rub so
it looks like a little path. And we're just mixing all
the colors on the canvas. Maybe, maybe maybe, maybe this is where the
horsey lived right here, and so the fence comes right on up, and you just let your fence
go wherever you want it to go. But as it gets closer to
you, it needs to get bigger, and these posts need to get
a little bit farther apart. and just let them get closer,
and bigger, and stronger. That's where this old
knife is so fantastic. It really makes beautiful,
beautiful fences. Okay, a little highlight on these fences. Bloop, bloop, boop. We're just using a little brown and white, a touch of blue in it. Just barely, barely touch it. You don't wanna cover up all the dark. Just a little. Now, while I've got hat color on the knife I'm just gonna add the tiniest
little bit of highlight here on these little rails. And you could also make these rails using your liner brush. That'd work. Tell you what, a little top on those. We'll just use a little
touch of permanent red here. (humming) there we go. Now, we're back to our brown, and we'll put some rails
coming right up through here. Touch, touch, there they go. Just like I say, this old farmer he just use whatever he
can find laying around. Limbs and sticks, trees that fell down in his back yard. You use what nature gives you. And nature gives you everything you need. See there? There it comes. And when you're at home,
maybe you want three rails on your fence, or four. Or maybe half of them's fell off. You have to make these decisions. And that's what makes it fun. Because it's your world. You create what you want. Now then, a little highlight
up here on these rails. But you can see how this little fence adds a lot of depth to the painting, changes your whole perspective. And it's really a lot of fun. Gives you a lot of practice
with this old mighty knife. Tell you what let's do, let's go back into our big
brush, get a little more of this yellow ochre, and we'll just put some little grassy things. This is yellow, add a little yellow ochre. And all we're gonna do here is just touch and let these little
things happen like so. See, we got our little path now. You need to bring some grassy areas right on down into your path. Cover up the foots of these. And if you pick up a little
of that dark, that's fine. I'm gonna take a liner
brush, a little paint thinner go right into some brown
paint here and there You know you never get the grass cut good around the bottom of the fence, so there's always weeds here and there. Wherever you want them. Just grab them, lift up. Tell you what, let's take
a little bit of thin oil little permanent red, sign this one, and call it finished. I really hope you've enjoyed this one and it's sparked your imagination and you've got your canvas out and you're ready to go. And with that, we wish you happy painting, God bless. ( "Interlude" by L. Owens)
