hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today I brought my little friend who'd own one more time so you could see him we've got so many cards and people have called asking about him I just want to show him again he's a little baby owl and he's one of the cutest little devils so if we can get him put his wings out here look at their knee beautiful he's about three weeks old now two and a half weeks or so and very very cute yeah he's going to talk a little bit he really is a beauty I am so fascinated with these little creatures and I hope you are too because I like to show them to you the credit there you see there we go it he's just nothing but down as I mentioned earlier him and I have the same hairdresser we both got the fuzz top up here okay tell you what it's time for us to go to work so I'm going to set him down I'll have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me today and we'll get started so I'll set him right over here in his little basket now this son of a gun has some talons on him that's just unreal even at his age they must be a half an inch long and he will get you not on purpose but that's just what happens tell you what I've got something a little different up here today I've had so many letters come in from people who like to paint on wooden objects asking if this technique can be done on wood I thought today I would show that so what I've done here is taken just a piece of plywood I've just sort of cut out a little design and when you're at home you can cut out any design that you want one thing you might do is when you cut it cut it at an angle so this slants outward on the sides all the way around and then maybe paint that a flat black when you're all done and it's like a frame so I've cut this out and then I've covered it with a thin coat of white gesso let that dry then I've just put a thin even coat of liquid white over it so it's ready to go basically it's the same way we do a canvas on its own wood and I thought today we just do a very simple little painting just to show you how it works we'll start out with a little touch of alizarin crimson on the two-inch brush just pull a little bit of the color out small on the Mount tap it into the bristles must put a little pink in this guy maybe right in here there we are now we don't want to set this guy on fire all we want to do is put a little pinkish glow in the sky just making little crisscross strokes but now in yours you can make it as bright or as dull as you want it's up to you totally up to you anything that you want to do there maybe a little more right in here no no that without cleaning the brush I'm gonna go right into a small amount other theta blue phthalo blue and just tap a little into the bristles very easy let's go right back up here now right at the very top still using our little crisscross strokes just begin putting in a happy little sky there we are just let it blend right on down to the pink and painting on this wood is very nice it's very solid and it works well you can also paint on masonite if it has all a coat or two a gesso on it we've just bring some little streaky things and here just by tapping and giving it a little blend you can make all kinds of little effects wherever you want as I was saying though masonite makes a very nice surface to paint on the only thing that's really different about wood or masonite is when you're using the knife this is very hard there's no give to it unlike canvas when you paint with a knife on canvas it it gives it bends to the shape of the knife this has no bend to it of course maybe we'll put a happy little cloud in there what the heck let's go into titanium white we'll use the old fan brush just titanium white be right back don't go away a little bit of right red in it will just Sparkle this up a little kings clip here maybe in our world there lives a happy little cloud here and you could put them anywhere you want just any old place tiny the circles tiny little circles okay they were brightening up just a wee bit there I hope you enjoy seeing hoot and all the other little creatures that are bringing you they are really very special to me and they're some of the best friends in the world I love little animals all kinds of little animals there and with a large brush I'm just gonna blend the bottom out just exactly the same way we would do in canvas just like so I still have a little squirrel that lives with me in my home he lives in a great big cage we call it squirrel Hilton why that little son of a gun name he is something else but he's a little bit to uncontrollable to to bring on the show maybe I'll take a picture let me show you one of the next series or something I couldn't keep him still along enough to bring him out here he lives him he lives in Florida I have a home in Florida and the squirrel stays there he knows about his cold weather okay maybe tell you what let's just take us a little black a little Prussian blue little crimson a Van Dyke Brown a day just dark colors pull it out very flat really get tough with it when you pulling it out like this pull it out as flat as you can get it go straight down with a knife touch and just pull it this knife has a straight edge on it so it's very easy to rule to load a roll of paint right at on the edge of the blade okay maybe in our world here there lives a happy little mountain and we'll do this just like we do when you're painting on wood but you can hear the difference of course and just really push that color in there's a little bump there where do you want just any kind of mountain that you want and maybe where you live or maybe in your painting you don't want a mountain if you don't leave it out just leave it out there we go now we'll just take the large brush and begin blending that color down because there's liquid white on this wood the paint will move it'll slide it's just fantastic and these wooden things are pretty in your house or you can paint such things as cabinet and doors or whatever you want just hang them around the house there beautiful decorations and you can cut any shape that you want I used to live in Alaska for years and years I lived in Alaska and I used to cut out maps of the state of Alaska and onto that then I would paint beautiful scenes and sometimes maybe even mount a little clock up here in the corner or something just you can buy a quartz movement to put on the back for only a few dollars and you can have a clock here with your painting and of course nobody's interested in selling paintings but if you're looking for that happy buck little things like that sometimes sell like hotcakes I'm going to take just straight titanium white with a little bit of a little tiny bit of bright red in it cut off my little roll of pain again just like before and let's just go up in here touch no pressure no pressure at all just let it glide soon make little noises see you can just clear it-- down the side of the mountain you'll go anywhere that you want to go with it there is another one there barely barely touching barely touching just caress it there mmm-hmm maybe the over in here there's a little bit of light playing through there it takes a white we'll put a little bit blue in it a little blue a little touch of black just to dull it down a little bit so we have sort of a blue gray color once again get our little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife then with that will come right a pair of touch and follow the mountain right down soon no pressure though all you're doing is just allowing the knife to float that easy and it's easier to do it fast that it is to do it slow one of the things we do when we're training instructors we have instructors that travel around and teach while I train these instructors one of them one of the tests that we give them we make them paint very very fast because you find that they can paint better fast sometimes and they can slow when you're doing things like yes it's hard to do it slow like this if you just do it it happens much faster much easier in the paint breaks better by braking we mean it has all these little holes in it and you can do that see anywhere you want to shadow you just drop in a little that blue in the opposing or opposite direction and you can make some mean rugged looking mountains with a clean dry brush I'm just going to tap the base of this just happen like so then very lightly blend it upward by blending upward all it does is take out the little tap marks brings everything together it creates that illusion of mist at the base of your mountain it's very soft and very delicate far away over here you follow these ankles it's most important when you're doing this tapping that you follow the angles in your mountain take a little more that blue of my brush just tap a little and sometimes it's fun just to take this and maybe we'll just bring it right on out and create a whole new plane in the mountain and all these planes are what create the illusion of depth and distance and we put some of the shadows back in here all kinds of little happy things there we go okay let me watch the old brush I know we wash our brushes as you know with odorless thinner shake it off beat the devil out of it now I'm just going to tap this that brush beating is so much fun hoots not too crazy about it though it sort of shakes him up he thinks he's next there we go and while I have blue stone that brush shoot will just go right into a little touch of crimson and come right across here throw in a nice little color just like so little lavender color in the middle and we'll go right into a little bit of phthalo blue and do the edges like so we'll just put a little bit of water down here what the heck but once again this is mixing with a liquid white and it's very smooth and it just flows if you had a dry board here that you were trying to paint on you would really be an agony city right now and you'd be very unhappy with me you'd be calling me names by having liquid white on there that's just slick as it can be your color is continually mixing with it and all these beautiful things just happen automatically okay maybe back here we have some little foothills we'll take I've got some black here and a little bit of Prussian blue brown little SAP green be right back and get a little a little white a little bit of white there we go maybe a little more Brown I want to dull that's getting a little too bright oh that's nice that's nice tap a little color into the bristles screw it up here now then maybe back in here just live some beautiful little foothills all kinds of little trees it are we back here in the distance I'm using the brush up like yes so it makes it look like the tops of just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of little trees I used to sit with little one haired brush and try to do these one at a time this is certainly easier okay now we just take a clean brush and I want to create the illusion of mist down the base of it here so all we're doing here is just tapping the bottom just the bottom see how it just sort of floats around in there very very lightly very easily just lift a little bit upward and that creates a beautiful misty area right in there now maybe there's more than one little foothill all you do is use the same color on the darker less white in it as things get closer to you in a landscape they should get darker and darker alright let's go right up here you have to make a big decision where's your little footy he'll live there he is now we don't want to lose all this mist in here see there's miss between them there you go now you can see see the mist in there that's important you don't want to lose it there lose that they just going to sort of blend together we just let that run right out I kept a little more color maybe shoot maybe just goes right on up here we don't know where it goes there we are but as long as it's a little bit darker then it'll show it'll look like it's closer to you I'm intentionally letting some of it hang down here below because we want to happy a little reflection under there it's all we do now decide where water and land meet pull straight down with a large brush just give it a little hmm little downward pull see there and once again because there's liquid white on here this is a wet surface so color moves now just go gently across and it'll give it a watery appearance instant reflections that easy little touch of the liquid white like so I will put the least a little bit of blue into it just to cool it down a little lose a very cool color it's nice pull it out flat and then take the knife and cut across let's do that one more time so you can see it pull it out flat and cut across that loads a little bit of paint right out of the edge of the knife okay now just push very hard we'll just cut in a happy little water line now this is a little slicker than worked in a canvas because it's wood so you have to hang on to your knife a little tighter because it'll slide up and down and make you unhappy and it'll run right on off down here somewhere that's one of the disadvantages of painting on wood or metal you can paint on metal the same as you do on wood if you want to paint on metal I recommend you paint it first with something that'll stop the rust just a spray paint or something if you're going to paint on metal then put your gesso on it allow that to dry and paint like normal if you want if when you're painting on metal for example if you want a little texture so it's similar to canvas I used to use a paint roller with a small short nap on it and it'll it'll make it feel like there's little bumps on it it'll give you a texture like canvas and it makes it much easier when you go over it much much easier to paint on okay let's do some little things back in here let me grab if you will use a fan brush today clean off a spot to work we will take some blacks impression blue Oh put some brown there what - anything you like I'm just SAP green lizard crimson pickle gaba paint long as it's dark okay let me clean my knife off here I just wipe the knife on a paper towel that or clean rag all works fine use old number 6 fan brush sometimes I use the number 3 sometimes I use number 6 doesn't matter whichever works well for you Kass go up here maybe in our world may be right there lives a happy little tree all right yes just work back and forth look at that a little son of a gun he lives right there in that brush right - can you let's give him a friend you know me thank you everybody needs a friend I think they're the most important thing in the world there we are this is a place for hoot to sit right up here the little owl kind of gotta have a place for him he sits right up there maybe tell you what maybe his little baby tree since hoots just a baby will give him a baby tree over here to set in maybe he's not brave enough yet to fly up in that big one so we're just give him up just a little tree just a little tree I like I like to show off the little animals we just done a whole thing in the newsletter about animals and showing some of the little squirrels and birds that I have so I hope you enjoy those there we are tell you what oh we got this old brush working here I'm going to just watch right here I'm just going to tap down see I was telling you reflections are easy watch here just there's a big tree there's a big stick now all we do is just put in some very very basic little ideas that's a sad looking tree but that's alright if you were upside down you'd probably look a little different to there we are put his little arms on you've upside down now then very lightly two hairs and some air just grab that and give it a little pull and we have instant reflections that easy look at that now watch right here watch see this is exciting I love to see these reflections work just go across you can push them see there make it look just like water see the shimmers not fantastic you have unbelievable power here should I get carried away sometime tell you what tell you what now when I cut this out I knew I was going to put a big tree here rest of it I didn't care about but I wanted a big tree so let's go right up in here and let's just put in this big old tree err I bet you knew from the beginning there was going to be a tree there when you saw that there we go we should have done that with a two inch brush it had been a little faster it didn't matter whatever is handy whatever you feel comfortable working with some people like to do it with a two inch brush some with a 1 inch brush some people like to do it with a shoe whatever it makes you happy and it doesn't hurt anybody else and it's alright ok there let's see how neat that is as I say when this is all dry if you go around these edges and paint on black you don't have to even frame it it's already framed there maybe I'm having so much fun making these evergreens this will give you some practice with little evergreens and maybe in your painting if you don't want to evergreens you can put a different kind of tree but you can cut out all kinds of different shapes sometimes it's fun if you're going to have like maybe an old barn or something cut the basic shape of the bar and halfway out of the piece of wood and then paint half of it in there and half of it out of there and it's neat you'll love it guarantee guarantee let's take your big brush pull it through the paint in one direction one direction that rounds one corner that won't turn it over so it rounded corners to the top so you're up here on the top corners around from pulling in one direction okay let's go up here with that rounded corner to the top push and Bend the bristles and just begin making some very basic little bush and grass shapes and you have to make some big decisions now where does this go maybe it comes down here wherever you want it doesn't matter doesn't matter you could really put this on with a paint roller start a whole new style of painting it's the highlights account but this is a good place to practice just making the brushwork and feeling how it feels when you push because so much of this is a feel I can show you how to do it I can tell you exactly how to load the brush but so much of it comes from practice and just doing it and very soon you feel exactly what's happening and you know soon as you touch the canvas if you have a bush or you have a blog devote a little time to practice it'll pay you big dividends take some white a little bit of the dark sienna leave it marble like that cut us off a little roll of paint and maybe in our old tree here here and there you can see the indication of a nice tree truck is showing through just here and there we won't see the whole thing this little tree maybe he's got a little trunk right there over here wherever you on them they're just indication just indication to do now let's grab another fan brush let's take a little bit of that tree color and mix it with some cadmium yellow that'll make a very nice green or a little SAP green either one okay let's go up here now then let's take this brush and come right along here just put some highlights right on these evergreens right on there wherever you want think about where the lights coming from in our mountain tells us a lights coming from the right so we won't or the bright highlight color on the right side then on the left side there that's a nice place for the little birds there we go and they have a place to sit these are beautiful little things these little wooden things to do and and give to friends and relatives as gifts or Christmas presents or for whatever occasion and it's very special because you did it people like people like gifts that that you make yourself for them a lot of times better than gifts you go out and spend a lot of money for because then it's per anybody can go buy something but to make something with your own hands and your own heart and give it to somebody because you care about them that's special that is really special there we go the bush lives there now if you have trouble making your paint stick and a small amount small amount of the liquid white or paint thinner when is put some little bushes there maybe we reflect some of those right down here into the water what the heck okay I take a large brush to hairs in some air one here and some here this is very light down and across makes those beautiful little mirror reflections now over on this side here maybe there's a happy little Bush lives right there see there okay I want to add a touch of paint thinner to our brush just to touch tell you what's fun I won't I'm going to go through some yellow they don't want to go over here and I will put just the corner of the brush into some bright red just the corner so you can see it let me turn the brush around see how top corners got a little red on it now watch if this works just right you'll have a little green Bush with red flowers look at that isn't that sneaky look at that it's beautiful and it so nice now we just put in all kinds of happy little plants and stuff wherever you want them another one may be right here working lairs they'll do the one is farthest away and always work forward forward forward a little more the paint thinner and we'll just keep right on going here working layers though work and layers and you vary your colors a little and in your world you pick out the colors that you want the colors that make you happy there add a little bit more on the bright red a little touch of Indian yellow yellow ochre very some of these little things maybe who there's a nice little bush he's sitting right here there we are now then with their knife just a clean knife we go up here in these dark areas scrape in our little sticks twigs all kinds of little things I won't take a little Ben Dyke Brown let's go right over here and put in a little bit of land there look at that a little brown and white though highlight put a liquid pipe on the knife I'll put in a water line we got that risk we'll just about finished I hope this shows you how you can take old piece of plywood and turn it into a beautiful beautiful painting that once again makes a fantastic gift to give to loved ones or just anybody you're looking for something to give for a gift so with that they will call this one finished for all of us here and from Oh hoot I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless ah production of this program is made possible by a grant from langnickel manufacturers of select artist brushes and by the Martin F Weber company manufacturers of
