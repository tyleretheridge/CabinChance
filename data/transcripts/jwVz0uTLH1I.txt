hello I'm Bob burrows and I'd like to welcome you to the 16th joy of painting series first of all let me thank you for inviting me back for another series of painting shows if this is your first time with us let me extend a personal invitation for you to get out your old brushes and your oil paints and paint along with us each show or just pull up the old easy chair which it foots up and enjoy a relaxing half-hour as we play some of nature's masterpieces on canvas tell you what let's start out by having to run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that come on let's go up here let me show you what I've already done I've got two canvases up here today we thought we'd do something a little different I get a lot of requests from people wanting to do like winter and summer or the different scenes so I thought today I would show you how to do two paintings at one time and this will be your challenge for the day so let's start out with no two-inch brush today I'm going to go right into a small amount of the phthalo blue just tap a tiny bit of it into the bristles just pull a little paint out and tap it but tapping assures that we have an even distribution of color all the way through the bristles okay let's go right up here now maybe on this one we'll just start up at the top and make little criss-cross strokes we'll say the one over on this side is our summer scene so we're just put in a happy blue little sky just like so just using little criss-cross strokes now the canvases were both coated with liquid white so the liquid white is continually mixing with a color and that allows us to actually blend color right on the canvas rather than working yourself to death on the palette of the canvas take a small amount of lizard crimson and maybe maybe right in here we'll just add a little touch of that it'll make a nice little lavender hue right in there just to Sparkle it up again there okay now then without cleaning the brush let's go right over to the canvas and let's say it's winter the other one will have winter I'm gonna take phthalo blue and I'll retread up here and get a touch of the midnight black because this is a winter I want to gray this guy a little bit want to make it a little chillier a little more mood to it okay and here we'll just once again use the little crisscross strokes and depending on what you want you can add more of the black you can gray it down or you can leave it brighter it all depends on you however you want your world to be that's the way it ought to be okay that's a nice little grey sky there so tell you what let's take some of that same color just the black in the blue that's all we need and let's go down here and let's have a little water in these paintings what the heck what the heck pull from the outside inward outside Emory there both sides that way to leave a little open area right in here and when it's all done it looked like a little sheen of light coming across there and be very pretty not very gently very gently three hairs and some air we just go across and blend that the little light area still remains in there okay and I'm going back into my phthalo blue and I might add a touch and let me say that again a touch of phthalo green it's very strong very strong it will go back to our summer canvas and let's do the same thing I put the green in there once again to make this one a little brighter this is summer it's happier all the birds are having a good time so that's what we want to show over here but still pull from the outside in there we go and very lightly just go across okay now we can wash the old brush and if you've painted with me before you know this is the fun part of this whole technique we wash our brushes with odorless thinner shake them off and just beat the devil out of them and that's where you take out your hostilities and frustrations and a lot of fun ok let's put some clouds in here what the heck take titanium white let's do the summer one first we'll take white be right back right back get a little touch of the bright red a little touch not much okay maybe their lives in our world a little cloud right up here we're making small little tiny circular strokes little tiny circles little tiny circles there we go just sort of let the cloud float around have fun maybe this got a little friend lives over here there see how easy that is now then on the other side in our winter scene I'm going to add a touch of gray to a little bit of the midnight black just to gray it down because once again we don't want this as bright now maybe this old cloud lives right here he just sort of floats around there but when you're doing this just sort of think like a cloud they're free and they have a good time and just just enjoy it little tiny circles and don't overwork it if you overwork it it'll begin to looking like a big cotton ball that lives up here in the sky we don't want that we want some life in this son of a gun all right now with a good clean dry brush I'm going to gently gently blend the base of these clouds just blend the base of it there we go now fluff them grab them and fluff them and then very lightly blend the entire sky and that easy you've got a fantastic little cloud and while we're going here let's do the little summer scene over here same basic thing fluff it pull it lift it they're very gently though there we go now then let's have some fun maybe in our world today maybe this little mountain back here I like the paint mountains I lived in Alaska for a dozen years and mountains are very are they very special to me I like them so it takes some black Van Dyck Brown put a little lizard crimson in it and a little bit of the Prussian blue very strong blue pull the paint out and very flat go straight down with a knife cut across and that gives us a little roll of paint right out of the edge of the knife okay now you have to make a major decision where does your mountain live maybe in our world lives right here I want this now it'll be quite small just a little tiny mountain it's far away it's all we need is just a basic little shape there's little bump lives right there the only thing we're concerned with is a nice outside edge we could care less what's happening down here don't worry about that we'll take care of that don't worry about it now over here we use the same color and we'll try to make a mountain that looks about the same we're trying to do the same scene and a winter in summer we'll make them look similar okay maybe right there once again we're only worried about the top of the mountain we could care less down here scrape off all the excess paint just scrape it off then with a large brush we want to grab this and move it because the liquid whites on the canvas you can literally move the paint this was a dry canvas you'd be an agony city right now and just blend it down same thing over here on this one grab it and pull it just pull it think about the angles in your mouth there we go I just let it just sort of blend right into nothing just like it's laying in the mist down here now then we go back to our knife and tell you what let's do we'll take some titanium white dark Sienna I'm going to mix them together but leave it marbled like that don't over mix and cut off our little roll of paint so right down the edge of the blade there let's go up here now this one over here that has the summer scene on it here I want some nice Browns on it and all kinds of things happening and by not over mixing the paint this happens automatically you get all kinds of beautiful colors and shades and tones you could work yourself to death trying to do this by mixing each color this is a lazy man's way of painting let the canvas work let the paint work maybe we'll put a little bit right out there there we go now then we need a shadow color for that I'll just take some oh use some dark Sienna a little bit of the Prussian blue in it that'll gray it down once again we cut off that little roll of paint a small amount of paint and we'll just put in a shadow so all there is to it just in an opposite direction just see there you can create just the illusion of all kinds of things happening in your world there we go maybe right in here just let that come down just like so and where you want them over here a little bit okay now then we'll take a clean dry brush be sure it's dry if it's not dry you're going to be upset with me because your color is going to sort of just mix together we just tap the base of it here we want to create the illusion of the mist soft misty areas down here at the base of the mountain if we lift it up and that'll sort of bring it all together there we go all right and that easy we have a summer type mountain now let's go over here to the cold side will take titanium white and there's a little bit of that gray color left in it not much once again our little rule of paint snow on this mountain as they say in Alaska the hawk has came there we are the old Hulk you put snow on the mountain and we'll just let that come right on out like it a little bit on this peak like we had on the other one so got to make those little noises or den work the hair we are let's take a little bit of the we'll use a little a little blue a little touch of the black in it a little white will make a happy little shadow color once again right out in the edge of the knife just let that doom but absolutely no pressure no pressure it just floats across there as I mentioned before and other shows when I was teaching my son Steve to paint I used to tell him to just pretend that he was a whisper floating across here it's that delicate of a touch just barely touched the canvas okay now then we'll tap this just to create that old illusion of missed again there just touch it like so okay yeah then maybe there's some maybe there's some little foothills that live back here so let's take we'll use use some wholesome black and brown and we'll reach up here get a little touch of the SAP green not too much green a little bit of white just to lighten it up okay let's go up here maybe on this one here we'll just touch with a corner of the two-inch brush and just make the indication a little distant foothills that live far far away they're just touching Manhattan there's going to be water down here let's have a reflection so all we'll do is just tap some of that color right down like so all right that's coming along nice and I'll take the big brush pull straight down straight down look there look at there instant reflections when I was traditional painter reflections used to drive me crazy and it's one of the easiest things you can do in this technique all right let's put some over here on the winter side we'll take some white some wait I'm gonna grab some black there we are a little bit of black least little touch of blue we want these to be gray once again this is winter it's a little more drab okay let's go out up here now same basic shape or just tap in there we are all there is to it just just think in your mind we're a little foothill lifts and put it in put it in this is your world on this piece of canvas and you could do anything at your heart desires here you have absolute and total power this is the only place in the world I have any power but here here I'm the dictator but I can do anything here anything and you can too just think of a scene in your mind and put it on canvas that easy we have a happy little reflection I'm going to dip the knife into a little bit of the liquid height just pull that through the right back get a little touch of crimson to brighten this one up pull it out and then cut across just like that let's go up here that let's put in just a happy little water line and we act just like we're trying to cut a hole in the canvas so all there is to it just a little ripple here and there okay on the other side I'm using just straight liquid white don't want the pink over there I want this one to be a little colder there see they're set easy though you can do it can do anything anything that the mind can conceive you can do at least up here alright now we have to make some big decision what lives up the foreground here I'm going to tell you huh let's just get crazy a little take so black so blue I grab some lizard crimson little Van Dyke Brown I'm not using any green in this then I'll use the same color on the both sides just the blues both blues and black brown crimson okay let's go right up here maybe maybe their lives in our world a nice tree big tree and he lives here and he watches everything yeah just push pins brush upward there we go maybe there's shouldn't Lee there's little land comes right across here I don't know just whatever you want here you can create any illusion that pleases you all we're doing is just filling that in okay now then pull the brush in one direction when you're doing this see one direction that causes a curve you turn the brush over so I'd curves to the top house go up here let's push in a tree over here on the winter scene same basic tree maybe we'll do one over here that's all covered with snow cold over here on this side had to wear a coat when you paint this one yes like so tell you what just so you have some practice let's let's do us a find a fan brush there let's do a happy little evergreen tree - we'll use some blue and some black and brown crimson test those same colors same old colors load the brush full of paint let's go ahead up here maybe in our world there lives does now mmm just a happy little evergreen tree just go back and forth back and forth see they live here in your fan base sometimes you have to sort of scare them out there we go there we go and leave some arms out here like this so the birds have a place to set when they come there and he goes down here somewhere we don't know where he goes over here let's put one about the same height and we'll just drop him in these little paintings will give you a lot of practice show you how to do all kinds of different things use all the equipment's all the colors we only use about a dozen colors 13 to be exact into those 13 colors you can do anything it's unreal unreal what you can do maybe see some time you change your mind maybe there needs to be a little baby tree right here don't want that tree to get only so we just put him in and when you do your painting let's go over here when you do your painting you just sort of look at it and you decide how many trees live in your world you can have two 10-0 any number in between any number in between s s this is a winter scene over here we need some snow on the ground so let's just take titanium white on the big brush just just pull some in there just like so now then decide where your snow lives maybe it lives right here into the trees just like so that's what's great about this whole big brush you can just do it quick see allow some of that dark color to pick up and pull it then it looks like shadows under these bushes and trees okay now then let's start having some fun maybe we'll highlight this so I will dip the brush into a touch of the liquid white on the one-inch brush and let's start out we'll go through CAD yellow let's do the summer one first just caddy I'll be right back don't go away right there a little bit of the SAP green added to it pull the brush in one direction though and look at the amount of paint that's in the bristles tremendous amount of paint that's what you need okay now if you have a lot of paint in here and it's a thin paint this is thinner than the paint that's already on the canvas we use a very firm dry paint up here now this is thin now all you need is a gentle little touch and you can put beautiful highlights out here on your tree beautiful highlights but now think like a tree tree has limbs it has little arms that live in here don't just don't stab these own at random think about shape there's little branches and stuff that live inside of here and they're little individuals they each have a personality okay we can add a little yellow ochre little Indian yellow here and there maybe a little touch of the bright red just a spark lit there okay a little touch Braintree head and shoot maybe there's a firecracker lives right out here mmm well that's pretty that's pretty so that we got see but work in layers now then come right up in here notice that we leave some of the dark areas those little dark areas in between are very important that's what gives you little bushes and trees depth okay now yeah let's take we'll use a fan brush here I'll just take a little yellow some SAP green mixed in it pretty dark color load a lot of pain in the bristles and our evergreen tree here just add some little highlights on them don't overdo this gets working so well that you just want to cover up all the dark and you lose your beautiful little tree then go away and leave you there okay now we here's an old dirty that's just two inch brushes dirty wheel just tap it right into various colors just tap give it a little push now that let's come right down here and we can begin putting in all kinds of little happy grassy areas that easy that easy think about the lay of the land here just layer after layer after layer okay maybe look at that so you can create a whole nother plane that that easy there but don't kill all that dark once again it gets it gets feeling good and you just go crazy and you can kill all that dark and then your painting gets very very flat looks like you almost like you cut it out a newspaper something glued it up here now we just take a knife clean line and here and there we'll just scrape in the indication of little sticks and twigs and little happy things that live all back in here that's all there is to it let's do the other one now now I have several fan brushes going so I don't have to spend all my time washing them we'll take we'll take some white be right back little touch it a phthalo blue nice warm blue very pretty there okay let's clip here maybe there's a little snow hanging on this tree there what see that's where the bird sit right out here even the wintertime they have to have a place to sit sometimes you when you painting you can almost you can almost hear the little birds there they just once again they'll make up little stories and think that this is your world it it becomes a special place to you and of course people may look at you like you're a little strange but us painters you know we have an artist license and says you can do anything on this canvas that makes you happy utilize that will take titanium white and liquid white mix together on the brush pull it in one direction load a lot of paint a lot of paint the liquid whites in there only to make the paint thinner let's go right up here but the rounded corner to the top and let's just put all kinds of beautiful little snow-covered limbs out here if you wanted to you could just take your liner brush and just make like a tree trunk maybe all the leaves fell off in your world I sort of like to have these snow-covered things to me it is just beautiful when I lived in Alaska everything looked like this in the winter times it is maybe one of the most beautiful times of the year in Alaska it's cold oh it's pretty it is so pretty God was having a good day when he made Alaska things were going right there we are and maybe down in here lives up a little bush there isn't just make up all kinds of little stories maybe over here see you can put a little blusher right there just wherever you want now then once again with our clean knife and come right up here with the camera see this dark area that's where you want to put your stems you don't want to put them up here put them down in the dark area because that's where you'd see them and just just scratch it a scratch of it all you're doing is allowing the canvas to show through okay once again though mainly in these dark areas we come over here drop in a couple just wherever you want okay find the old liner brush go into some paint thinner some dark Sienna and we want this paint to be thin like ink turn the bristles turn it a lighter brush has very long bristles on it loads a lot of paint there we go okay maybe maybe in our world right up here lives it a little stick just take touch and it helps here if you're a little nervous makes a much more interesting little stick than one is just straight or I think so just you sort of make the decision maybe in your world you want all straight sticks I like to have them with little character can't we take that same color let's go over in the winter side and maybe the little stick lives right here see there he is there he is you knew he was there they're just touch it give it a little pull so all there is to it and you can put them wherever you want and that's how easy it is to make two scenes at once I'm gonna take a little more the paint thinner going to some bright red and let's sign these and just then you paint once again just like it was inked and you can sign on wiggle step right over to the winter one sign it and I think we're all finished we have two paintings today for the price of one there we are and I hope you've enjoyed this and it shows you how to do a winter and a summer scene off the same pallet at the same time think you'll enjoy and from all of us here happy painting and god bless I'll see you next time ah you
