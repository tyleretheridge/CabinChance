- Hi, welcome back, glad to see you today. I thought today we'd
do a little sea scape. So, I'll tell you what, let's start out I've brought all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you this crazy thing I've got up here today. Today I have my standard old canvas, but I've taken a piece of contact paper and I've cut a design out. In fact, the design, if
everything works just right, will sort of look like a seashell. On the top, I've painted the, little more than half, I've painted it with gray gesso. On the bottom, black gesso. And then, we've taken and
covered the entire thing with a very thin coat of liquid clear. Just enough to cover, you don't need much. On the bottom, down here, I've taken a little bit of Phthalo Blue and Phthalo Green and put it, just put a little color right on there and right at the very bottom, a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. That's all. And I've got a piece
of little masking tape right here to keep the horizon straight. Believe it or not, it's a
lot simpler than it sounds. Let's start with a little
Indian Yellow today, and let's just go right in here and drop in a little bit of color using the old two inch brush. Just like so. I like using this gray and black gesso it makes some gorgeous effects. Just absolutely gorgeous. Take a little bit of white, a little bit of Yellow
Ochre and mix them together and come right above that. A little touch of the
Titanium White in it though. That'll make it shine, sparkle. Alright. Okay, now then. I want it to be very bright
right there at the horizon. Once again, this little
piece of masking tape here is just to keep the horizon straight. Okay, without cleaning the brush, I going to go right into a small amount, a very small amount, of the red, Bright Red. Bright Red. Maybe a little touch of the
Titanium White in it again. Since we have no color on the top, sometimes you need to put a little bit of white paint with it. There we go. Isn't that pretty already? I like these colors. And you can do this to any degree of brightness that you want. Alright. Now, maybe a little Alizarin Crimson. I'm going to add a little
bit of white to that, too. Alizarin Crimson, Titanium White. And let's just put a
little of that in there. I want it to get progressively darker as we move away from the horizon. Okay, as I say these colors
are pretty just like that. Just like that. And, right up here at the very tippy top let's have, I'll tell you
what, let's use Phthalo Blue. I like Phthalo Blue, it's very pretty. And, we'll just put a little
touch of that in there. There. A little bit of Titanium
White with it also. Okay, maybe a little more white. If you want it to stand
out a little brighter, add a little more of the white. Okay, see there, that's
all there is to it. Now then, let me just wash the old brush. I'm just looking for an
excuse to wash the brush. Shake off the paint thinner. (taps brush) (laughs) Just beat the devil out of it. If you're going to do that, be careful, you can change the decor
of a room in a heartbeat. There. Something about like so. Now then, that gives us
a pretty nice little sky. Very colorful, very effective, that's not bad at all. Just beat the excess paint out there. Let's take, let's take
a little Phthalo Blue, Alizarin Crimson,
proportionately much more crimson than blue, I want this to be sort of to the reddish side of lavender. Okay, there we are. Now, let me clean the old brush, knife, whatever we've got. Let's find a, we'll use
a number 3 fan brush. It doesn't matter, that's what I picked up so that's what we'll use. Load a little color on it. You don't need a whole bunch, just a little color on it. Okay, let's go up in here. Maybe in our world here, there
are some happy little clouds that just float around and
have a good time all day. They just sort of float around just decide where they live in your world and drop them in. Drop them in. Wherever, wherever,
wherever, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. There, just sort of stir them up on there. We're going to come back
with a little blender brush and softly blend them together. There, we'll just use this little, we'll just blend it with
this little two inch brush. See? Very gently. Very, very gently. That easy. Using just the top corner of the brush making little tiny circles. ♫ Tiny little circles ♫ There you go, just like that. Okay, now then. Over here, we'll just blend it. Blend it and blend it and blend it. And then maybe ♫ in our world ♫ maybe, yeah why not. Maybe there's several little clouds. We can have as many clouds as we want. In your world, you
decide how many you want. Drop them in. Now use this lavender color,
because if you use blue and went into this yellow,
guess what you'd have? You know, don't you? You'd have bright green. And we don't want that
today up here in the sky. Sometimes, maybe a little
green in the sky is okay, but not today, not today, not today. There. Shoot, while I've got that going, maybe over here there's
just a little stringy cloud. See, just put in a basic shape, that's all you need, that's
all, it doesn't matter. Clouds are very easy. (taps brush) There. Beating that brush just
to take off excess paint. I used it before to blend, so
it collected a little paint. But when you're doing clouds like this, do them in layers. Do the one that you think
is the farthest away first. And then put the next layer
a little closer to you. Put it on top, that way it has the feeling of depth and distance. Alright. Now this is just a very, very simple way of making some little
clouds in a seascape. Very easy, even if you've never
painted a seascape before. This one, I believe you
can do without any problem. Alright, this little cloud
here, just blend over it. See, it'll just softly go
right into the painting. That easy. Take a brush here, and
take a little white paint. And you can blend this out and make it look like there's
light shining through. There's a million things you can do. When you start this,
practice and have fun. Don't just try to do exactly
what we do here on TV. Do your own thing. Do your own thing, that's
what the young people say. And it's true in painting. Just get in there and do it. There. I like to work with young people because they don't know any of the fears that we know when we get a little older. They just get in there and do it. I'm going to take this
little piece of tape off now. Just slip it right off. There we are, now, see our horizon line is perfectly straight, or
as straight as the tape was. It just makes life a little easier. Okay, take a little white,
take a little of that same old cloud color I was using. Maybe far back in the
distance in our world here, maybe there's a little headland
that lives out in here. It comes way out, wherever
you want it to go. There. See? That's all there is to it. Far away, we don't want a lot of detail. It's too far away. Much, much too far away. Give it a little pull, just
to blend the color together. Because that canvas is wet,
paint will move on it that easy. See, already it looks like
a little piece of land far, far in the distance. Okay, let's wash the old brush. Fan brush isn't near as much fun to wash as the two inch brush is. Now then, we have to start
making some big decisions. For me, the easiest
way to paint a seascape is to first determine where
your major wave is going to be. Or the big old crasher wave. In our world, I think it's going to be maybe right there, crash over. Come back this way. Helps to make little sounds
like you are at the ocean. Now if this doesn't make any sense, think about it, right here
it's going to crash over. Okay, does that make sense now? Hope, so, and maybe back in here a little thing like that. That's really about all we need. That's really about all we need. Okay, let me wipe the brush off. I'm just wiping all the excess paint off. Now then, we want to start creating the shape of these waves. And what's important
here is the dark area. Save the dark area. That's what we're looking for. See, there? Can you see what's happening? I know at first, it doesn't make sense when someone says save the dark area. But the dark is what will
form the basic shape. The light, no big deal. See, the same thing back here. Already, you're beginning to see the little trough between the waves. See that dark area right there? It's the most important,
most, most important. And then we can start putting in just little indications of
things that are far away. We have that Phthalo Blue
and Phthalo Green color that's underneath on
the dark, black canvas. And these things just work. Look at that color. If people don't see you put this color on, do a demonstration for
your family or friends, and don't let them see
you put the color on. It'll drive them crazy. They'll think magic is happening there when they see all these
colors that just explode. Because the canvas will still look black. Alright. Now then, let's start deciding. We'll take a little yellow, Cad Yellow, and a little white, right in here. Right in here will be the eye. So we'll put that yellow in there. We'll just use a fan
brush, it doesn't matter. Filbert brush works
very nice for this too. Okay, better wash that
brush, it's a little dirty. Because we want this
brush to be very clean so we can blend the eye of that wave. The pretty part. Okay, now we take just
the corner of that brush. Just the corner, and just very gently, very gently, using just the corner just begin to turn it a
little bit, just wiggle it, and it'll blend that
out as smooth as silk. Just like that. Now, I changed corners, so
we still have a clean corner if you want to go back and
blend it a little more. Don't take a dirty corner back in there. Alright, see there? But isn't that neat? Already, you can see the light
zinging right through there. (taps brush) And it's very simple. Very simple. Seascapes, seascapes
can give you a hard time when you first start them. I try to make them as simple as possible. Titanium White on the fan brush. Titanium White. This is the fun part. That's where the old wave just crashes over and has fun. Take some of that lavender color, I've still got the same brush, a little white on it, doesn't matter. And some of that lavender color that we, that we made for the sky and the little headland in the background. And let's begin putting
in this shadow here. This is just the shadow for the crasher. There it comes. Maybe it splashes clean up like that. I don't know. We'll put some stones
in there, what the heck. So it has something to crash on. I like to put little stones in seascapes. There. Just let that crash right on back. See, just let your imagination go. Sort of try to think like a wave. Think that you're down at the ocean today and you're having a good time and this is what it looks like to you. Let's wash the old fan brush here. I'm still using the
number three fan brush, but you could do it with the number six. You might find, you might
find the number three is just a little easier, a little easier. I'm going to take Titanium White. Still using that number three fan brush. Add a little, light
touch of yellow into it. Cad Yellow, but a light,
light touch, not much. Now then, let's go up in here. And now we can come in here and begin putting some highlights on this foam. Just highlight it. There we go, you don't want to kill all that nice shadow color that we worked so hard to put in there. Just think about that old
wave crashing over there. There it comes. Let it just churn and carry on. These things get violent. If you're a surfer, you sure
know what I'm talking about. Boy, they get violent sometimes. Good clean, dry two inch brush. Barely, barely touching. Just barely touching with the corner. Blend it, blend it, blend it. You could do this with a
little soft blending brush too. It would work just as
well, probably better, now that I think about it. But isn't that neat? See the old wave coming over there crashing and banging and carrying on. Alright. Maybe let's take some Midnight Black, Midnight Black, Van Dyke, we
just mix them together here. I've got another fan
brush, number six now. And, maybe in our world, yup, there's a big old stone. Right in there. Right in there. Big old stone. And, maybe there's another stone there where all this is crashing and churning it coming in right, like
that, like that, like that. See? Now sometimes you can
take the liner brush, we'll use some Bright
Red, it doesn't matter, there's paint thinner on it. And you can go in here
and just very carefully begin to shape your rocks. You can just shape them. There, see? Just enough to give them a little high- I want them to stay very dark. Very, very dark. Very dark. But that's a neat way of just putting in all kinds of little details. Here comes another one. Right there. Get a little more paint thinner. There, see? But that's one of the
easiest ways I've ever seen of forming the basic
shape of little rocks. Because you don't, you
don't have to do much. And I'm a lazy painter. Now then, you take a little, a little white, with a little
touch of Phthalo Blue in it. And do the same thing if you want to show, like, water is running off those rocks. Thin the paint, very, very thin, and then you can have this just churning and carrying on here any
way that you want it. Then back to our little fan brush. Have it sort of climbing
up in here and there. Covering up the edges. Boy, there's a lot going on in there. But isn't that neat? And you can do it. Okay, now maybe, we put a little Van Dyke Brown right in here. Let's take, let's take
a little Yellow Ochre, a little Titanium White, we'll just put it on the old brush there, maybe a little Cad Yellow in there too, that'll brighten it, oh yeah, that's it. That's it, now let's decide
maybe the water is coming right down here, and
there is some reflections in the wet sand, so pull it straight down and then go across. That's all we have to do. And that will give the impression of wet water or wet sand. Wet sand is what I meant to say. Take a little Titanium White, a little Phthalo Blue, mix them together. Wipe off the knife. Now we'll get a little roll of paint, just like we normally
put on the big knife. And with that, I'm going to start using a lot of pressure. And, really bend the knife. Bend it. Alright, this is where we decide where the water line is. Where it's coming up on the bank. There. And maybe it's coming down through here. However you want it. However. Take our little fan brush, once again, grab that and begin pulling it. See there, isn't that gorgeous? It works easy. It works so easy. And you begin to have foam patterna and stuff that are
coming down through here. Like that there. All kinds of little doers. A little filbert brush
works great for that too. See, you can just take it and go. Make all those little
watery things that happen. Let's use our script
liner brush with that. Put a little bit of the
blue and white on here. And let's begin putting
the indication of all kinds of little things that
are happening in here. There they come. Now when you have a lot of time, you can put tremendous
amounts of detail in this. Tremendous. There. Paint thinner. I want to go into that
dark lavender color, and I need a little dark line that lives right under
here to pull this up. Little dark line, see it? There it comes. Alright, and, you also need it right in here, it separates, separates it. Makes it just jump right out at you. Maybe you can see a few
little dooders right in there. That helps create that curve that you want so badly in that wave. There we are. Okay. (taps brush) And you can take a little blue and white and make the indication that maybe there are some little watery
things that are happening all about through here. See there? Just to make it look like water. That easy. Okay, a little bit of Titanium
White and paint thinner. A touch of blue right here,
but just mainly white. And then you can begin putting in some details back in here. Just all kinds of little things. Just to give it a wave action type feel. You can put all kinds of
little doers in between here. Once again, when you have time
to put all these things in, just take your time and do it. Something like so. You know, I've gotten so
many letters from people all over the country, and
one of the earlier shows I showed a cartoon version of
my little squirrel, Peapod. Well, people have asked to see that again, so I'm going to put him
up for just a second to check out old Peapod, isn't that cute? And I've got another surprise for you, my cartoonist, he got a little crazy. Guess what he made a cartoon of now? Old Bob-a-loop. So, I guess you'll be seeing Bob in cartoon form pretty soon. But isn't that cute? I think so, my little painter man suit. It's just like the little
opening that Jerry makes for us. It's cute though. Little painter guy. Alright. I've got a minute left here. I want to, yeah, check out your bravery. Okay, maybe we'll have us
a little palm tree in here. Maybe we'll have a big palm tree. Alright, give him a friend. There we go. Just a little old palm tree. I'm going to grab another fan brush, I have several going. We'll take, let's use a
little, doesn't matter, use a little, a little light color here. Just tap along the edges and give it a little pull. Make it look like a palm
tree lives right there. A little bit on this one. There. Just to give it the, just to give it the
impression of a little tree. Now then, I want to take the brush that has the black paint in it, this is Midnight Black, and I've put paint thinner with it to thin it. Just to thin it. Now then, here we go. Here we are. Just take and let's just pull in a few little leaves on this old rascal. I'm from Florida, so, we have a lot of palm trees around there. There we are. Okay. Someone asked in what
part of Florida I live in. I live right in Orlando, right close to Mickey Mouse's house. There we are. But very soon, when we
start a show in Missouri, I'll be moving there. So I hope to see you in either place. Alright. There, see? That's a very, very nice, easy way to make a palm tree
that looks pretty good. Pretty good. Alright. A few little old limbs on him. And you decide how many
limbs are on your palm tree. And if, where they're situated, how they're blowing, and
the wind is usually blowing, around the old ocean here. There we are. And you can come back
with your liner brush and put a lot of greens and
stuff in there if you want to. Okay, I'll tell you what, let's
pull the contact paper off and see what we've got here. And, as I mentioned earlier, I tried to cut this into
something that looks sort of like a seashell. And that's a little different. I have done some that I've taken like the pattern of a fish. A fish swims in the ocean, so I don't see anything wrong with having the ocean in the fish. Any pattern that you want works very well. Try it. If you have time, take a photo. Send it to me, let me
see what you are doing. We're going to call that
little painting finished. And from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. ♫ "Interlude" ♫
