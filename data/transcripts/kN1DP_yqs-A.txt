- Hi, welcome back, certainly
glad you could join us today. It's a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you're at. So I tell you what, let's get started. Let's have them run all of
the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. And while they're doing
that let me show you what I've got up here today. I have my standard old canvas up here, but I've cut a little
oval out of contact paper and stuck it on. And then I've covered this portion up here with gray gesso and the
bottom in black gesso. And don't laugh at my wavy line, I know it's not straight. Then I've covered the entire thing with just a very thin, thin
coat of liquid clear. So it's all wet and ready to go. So I thought today maybe
we'd do a little seascape. One that's very simple, very easy, and one that we'll just
have some fun with. So let's start out with a
little bit of Indian yellow. I'm just going to load a
tiny little amount up here. I want a seascape that's
very bright and shiny. So we'll just take a little
of that Indian yellow and we'll just run it
right along like that. Somewhere. Maybe, without cleaning the brush we'll go right into a
little bit of yellow ochre. There. Just something like that. That's really all we're looking for. I'm going to come back and add a little white in
that and brighten it up. But we're just putting some little base colors under it right now. There we go. And just let that sort of blend upward. And once again without washing the brush I'm going right into a
little bit of a bright red. Just a small amount, doesn't take much. Doesn't take much. Now the gray gesso
underneath will dull that so it's not so bright
that it hurts your eyes. There. Maybe just a touch more. Right in there. Something along that order. That's all we're looking for. Now then time to wash the brush. And that's really the most fun
part of the whole procedure. So let's do that. Let's wash the old brush. Just wash it off good, give it a shake (brush tapping) (laughing) And there we go, there we go. Now a little bit of the titanium white. And let's start right in here with white. And then we can begin painting
right over the top of that. Just begin right over. I want this to be the
brightest area, right here. Maybe the sun sorta, maybe
it just went sorta went behind the horizon right there. I don't know. You just decide and put
it wherever you want it. And blend upward. Now we're just going to blend upward. Let that white mix with all the
colors you put on the clear. And a small amount more of the white. There. Just let them all blend together. Something like so. Alright. I like skies and seascapes
that are very bright and shiny. They just seem to make you feel better. And you can do this several times to achieve a desired brightness,
up to you, up to you. See now when we hit
that bright red up there it makes a gorgeous paint color. That easy. That's about all I'm going
to do for that little sky. Now, I think today I'm
going to take a little phthalo blue, some alizarin crimson mix it together proportionately. Much, much more crimson than blue. I want sort of a reddish lavender color. Maybe a touch more blue in it. There, I think that's just right. Just right. Wipe off the knife. Let's use the, we'll
use the fan brush today. Load a little color on the fan brush, just by going back and forth, that's all. And maybe in our world there lives. Here's your bravery test right off today, a big old strong cloud
lives right up here. Just floats around and
has a good time all day. There we go. There, big old cloud. I said a big strong cloud,
I guess I was serious. But I'm going to start on
the cloud that's the darkest. Which to me would be this one. And maybe we'll make a few more. But now we're beginning to
have less paint on the brush. Less and less paint. So automatically it's going to get a little, little, lighter in value. Let the canvas work. The brushes work, the color. Just go with it. Go with it. As I've mentioned before this is certainly the lazy man's way of painting. And I look for easy ways. Maybe, there's a little
paint left on the brush. Maybe there's a little
cloud that's right there. I don't know, I don't know. Just basically wherever
you think they should be. We'll put several in here, just so you have a little
practice with clouds. There maybe. Okay, okay right there
a little string even. Something like so. Maybe even one over here. But that's really all we need. (brush tapping) There that had a little color
on it, but I just banged it to knock the color
off and we can go in here and just blend this some. This will pick up the excess paint. There. I tell you what, I want a softer brush. I want to pick up the blender
brush so I can get in here and make all kinds of
little soft things happen. Very gentle. With this blender brush you
can go right over all this without mixing it together. Just bring it together. There. Something about like that. That's all we're looking for today. And that gives us a sky full of clouds. We'll wash that little brush out. (light tapping) It's not near as much
fun to beat that one. Don't like to beat that one
near as much as the other ones. Maybe I'll blend that
one a little bit more, now that it's clean. Okay. Let's spend the majority of our time today working on the bottom. I'm going to take phthalo
blue and phthalo green and just mix them together
on the brush here. Blue and green, phthalo blue and green. Okay let's go back up in here. And I'm just going to cover. Right along like that. See my crooked horizon
didn't matter at all now. And they were laughing at my
horizon line in the studio before we started this. But it doesn't matter. There, because we don't make mistakes. Okay, that's just applying a little color to the liquid clear. Then I'll wash this brush. (brush tapping) And we're in business again. Now we'll mix up some sap
green and alizarin crimson. I want to make a nice transparent
chocolate brown color. And these two colors make
a gorgeous, gorgeous brown. Gorgeous brown, alright. But it's a very transparent brown. And we can take our brush,
with this transparent brown And I'm just going to fill
up the bottom of this area with a little bit of that brown. I know you can't see it. And that's the beauty of it. That's how you tell if
a color is transparent, if you put it over black and you still, it still seems to be black to you than the color's transparent
enough for what we're doing. Can be semi transparent. But it will work. Now let's find a little
number three fan brush today. I find in seascapes
one of the easiest ways of getting one started,
figure out if you're going to have a big major wave,
figure out where it lives and then work around that. So let's say our major wave
is going to live right here. There's the top of it. It's going to come out
maybe and go like so. Behind it then we can
have whatever we want. And that just sort of gives you a little layout back in here wherever. See maybe this will help. The waves going to curve over like that. Does that make sense now? Crash right over. That's all there is to it. And that sort of gives you an idea of where everything is going to live. Let's have a little in
the background back here. We'll take a little white a little bit of our
lavender color that we made. Mix it up, we'll just mix it on the brush. Doesn't much matter. And up in here, maybe we'll
add a little black to that. Yeah, yeah I like that. Maybe in our world, right
back in here is a little, is a little headland that lives back here that just sort of projects
out into the water. There, something like that. See, that's all there is to it. No big deal. Now we have one out there. I'm going to go back
to the small fan brush. And now we can start picking out things. Today maybe I'll use the
little fan brush some. I'm going to strengthen these. Actually what I'm doing is
adding a little white paint Just a little white paint. And I'll show you why. Let me wash that brush. There we go. Now be sure it's clean and dry. And the paint that's up here is enough to do what we want to do. We're going to take that
and begin pulling it back. Just pull it back. See, just pull it back. But notice the strokes there. Sort of rocking like little strokes. Very, very important. And what you're interested in is the dark area, not the light area. There just wipe off the paint. See there, just little rocking strokes. And from here lead them back. Try to maintain that dark
area in there though, that's what we're looking for. That's the goody. Now the most fun part of doing seascapes is the eye of the wave. Or the transparency,
whatever you want to call it. Let's say it lives right here. We can still use the little
fan brush, it doesn't matter, or you can use a filbert. Scratch in a little bit of that. But we're really applying
a lot of pressure. We're really pushing that
color right into the canvas. And you can do it several times to achieve a desired lightness. But I'd recommend you
wash the brush each time so you start with a nice fresh color. There, we about wore this
brush out washing it. But that's okay. Now to our little blender. And very lightly. This little blender's wonderful for these. Wonderful, because you can make thing here that are absolutely
just as smooth as silk. There we go, just tiny little circles. But the bristles aren't hardly moving. Just wind it up. There, just a nice little
light spot out there. A little hair there. Alright. Okay, now we can begin
putting some goodies in there. Let's take a little bit
of the titanium white and think about where the
water's going to crash over here. It's going to go, shew, like so, You've got to make those
little noises though, if you don't make those little
noises it just doesn't work. No, that's not true, you
don't have to make those. I like to make them, but
you know how painters are we're sort of different, a little weird. There we go, that's basically all we need. And to make the little
crashing thing there we'll take that, we're
using lavender in this so we'll just continue with it. Works well. Just load a little bit
of that lavender color, I'm going to add a touch more blue to it, get a little more to the blue side. There we go. Now maybe, I don't think
you'll be able to see this, but it's just a shadow color
I'm putting underneath. There you can see it as
it comes up over here. See just a little shadow,
so when we put that nice foam on top of it, it
will jump right out at us. But you need that dark color underneath, just sort of bring it all together. Once again you could
do this with a filbert, and I do a lot of the times. Today I just sort of got
started with a little fan brush and decided to go with it. Doesn't matter, anything
that works for you. Load a little bit of
titanium white on here. There just a little crasher, just a little bit of crashing
going on out in here. Just wipe of the paint,
reload it sometime. There we go. Little more paint. Shhh, as I say these
little noises sorta help me I like em. Okay,now then. Let's take a little
blender and very lightly, just barley touch, just barley touch. I'm going to blend this
edge out a little bit, right in here, very soft. Alright. There we go. And now then we can start
having some fun here. Take the paint thinner, little
bit of the titanium white, And let's make a thin paint here so we can just start putting some
of the goodies in here, some of the things that
really make it stand out well. There we go. Little more paint on the brush. See, just pick out all the little waves. Way back in the distance here, shh. There. That's a very simple
way of making a seascape that's very colorful, quite effective. You'll like it, you'll like it. And let some of these
things just work down. See you begin getting all kinds of little foam patterns in here. There they go. This is where you create
this shape in the wave. This is what makes it all come together. There we are. Okay, maybe, let's see here, we had alizarin crimson and
sap green to make brown. Make up a little more brown. And maybe in our world, maybe in our world We will use a filbert here,
maybe right over here in this this little crasher wave lives, a big old stone. Right there. Just making that out of brown. Comes right down into the crashing wave, just going all over that. Let me wipe off the excess paint. I'm going to put a
little bit of bright red. Maybe a little lavender mixed with it. Oh, that's nice. That dulls it down just a little. There, and we'll just sort of form us some basic little rocks out
here, we don't much care. I like doing little seascapes like this, they're so much fun. So much fun. I was born in Daytona Beach, Florida. So I sort of grew up around the water, sort of grew up around it. There. I still spend quite a bit
of time over by the beach. I like that, I like the water. Put a little, a few little splasher
doers all up through here. Little splasher doers,
that's a word I made up. But you know what I'm talking about. Steve, my son, now both seem to have this tendency to make up words. Alright, down here I want
a little beachy area. So I'm going to take a little white. A little white, a little
touch of the cad yellow in it. Figure out where you want the beach to be. Pull straight down. Just pull it straight down. See, that brown now shows up. I then go across. Already it's beginning
to look like wet water just by doing that. Take our knife, small knife, small knife. Get a little roll of paint on it. Figure out basically where you want the little ripples to be. There they come. Firm, firm pressure, really
firm, bending the blade. Don't break it, but bend it. And that will help give you that illusion there
that you're looking for. Alright, and maybe in our
world, yep you're right, there's another one,
something about like that. Goes right off that edge. That's okay, take fan
brush and very lightly, we want to grab that and pull it back. Just give it a little backward pull. There, but basically pretty straight, if anything let it tilt downward so it looks like the water
is running downward there. We can use a little filbert,
put a little white on it here. And we can just begin working
on all kinds of little, little patterns and little things, little foam patterns that
are happening in here. Let them happen, don't worry about em. There they go. See and maybe in here there's some, just little things going on. There. Just give it a little pull. Angles are most important in here though. Pay very close attention to your angles. They can be your best
friend, or your worst enemy. Just depends on, just
depends on how they go. A little bit more of the titanium
white, little blue in it. Come along and enforce
some of these things. Now at home, where you
have unlimited time, you can really put some time in here, you can put all kinds of little details. That's what makes your painting special. That's really what makes it gorgeous, what makes it stand out. There, just sort of skip
around here and there and put all kinds of little doers in. There we go. (tapping) Now then, back to my little filbert brush that has the brown on it. And maybe there's a little stone
over here on this side too. Shoot, bet he's got a friend right there. We'll have little rocks
all over the place. Okay, a little bit of the bright red. And we'll come right in here and just highlight that little stone. Just enough to make him stand out some. Take a little bit of the
liquid white on the knife. And just like if we were
in water you can put little water lines right around it so it looks like it's part
of the whole overall scene. There. Liner brush, oh liner brush. We take a little bit of the brown. A little bit of the brown. You know me, I've got to have a tree. I've got to, okay, little tree. But I need a tree, I like trees. Maybe, off of this old rock
here there's one old tree. That's trying to make it. He's trying to make a living
out here on this rock. This is not the best
place to try to survive. Maybe he didn't, maybe he didn't. Gnarly old tree. So the arms are wiggly. He's really had a hard life. Okay See that tree has some character. This would be a nice tree for
the seagull to come land in. Sit up here and see what's
happening, he could check it out. Okay take a little more paint thinner. A little bit of that lavender color, but I'm thinning it down
too, very thin, very thin. Just about like ink. And underneath this little wave here, I wan to put a dark line. A dark line will separate. And we can see little seaweeds
and things through there. But this is how we shape the wave. We have curves now,
you can see through it, it's transparent. We can see right through that rascal. Little of that dark right along in there. That dark is your good friend right here. It separates once again. There, something like so. And you just sort of vary
these back and forth. I'm going to go into
the white with the least little touch of cad yellow
thinned down with paint thinner. Right underneath here,
where it's the brightest, we can begin putting
some nice bright shiny little highlights that are just
zinging right through there. See you can just put those
wherever you want them. Something like that. And that's basically how to do
a very simple little seascape Let's take the contact paper
off now and see what we have. You never know until
you take the paper off whether it's going to work or not. And I think this one
turned out pretty good. Pretty good for a quickie. Let's take a little bit of the bright red, a little paint thinner. I think this one's ready for a signature. So we'll just come right down in here and sign this little rascal. Like that. I hope you've enjoyed this one. If you have time, send me
a picture of your attempt. I'd love to see what you're doing. And from all of us here I'd
like to wish you happy painting and God Bless my friend.
