hello I'm Bob Ross and I'd like to welcome you to this our seventh joy of painting series if you've painted with us before I'm certainly glad to see again if this is your first time with us I think you'll really enjoy this fantastic wet on wet painting technique we'll use about a dozen color some sorta unorthodox brushes it will have a lot of fun and each week we'll do a fantastic painting here I hope you drag out your paints on your easel big glass of iced tea and you sit down and you join meat week and learn the joy of painting so I'll tell you what let's do let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do the painting we're going to do today and they'll come across your screen in exactly the same order as I have more my palette starting with a titanium white and working around and while they're doing that let's talk a little bit about what's been done on the canvas I've already covered this canvas with a thin even coat of liquid white this makes a canvas wet makes it slick it allows us to actually blend color right here on the canvas instead of working ourselves to death on the palette and today I thought we'd do a painting that uses a very limited palette in other words only a few colors and I'll show you how you can do a beautiful painting using only a couple of colors some big brushes and let's go up here and do it I'm going to take off today and go right into some Van Dyck Brown and we'll use this whole big brush and I'm just gonna literally tap some of the color right into the bristles suggest you tap that way it it gets a nice even distribution of color all the way through the brush see there both sides nice and even good let's go to the canvas let's start out today right up here it will make little X patterns little crisscross strokes just this isn't this is the way the teacher used to grade my paper in school once you just go through it and make all these big X's that's the kind of grades I get there we go now this color is blending with a liquid white and automatically beautiful things begin happening continue to keep this brush moving don't stay in one spot and just and just work the color did we want some we want some life in this guy there we go just keep it going now as we work downward here maybe we'll put a little bit of warmth down here this is gonna be the horizon area right down in here so go right into a little bit of dark Sienna without cleaning the brush and tap a little of that right into our bristles just a small amount all right watch here now we'll go right up here and with that color I'll blend sort of upward so we have a nice warm color right at the horizon and it goes up into the Van Dyck Brown a little more color and let it work up working in that fantastic you know while I have this little dirty brush it has all the Browns on it I'm gonna take and add a little touch of yellow ochre to it so we've got the sienna and the brown add a little bit more of each there no let's go get out here to the bottom of the canvas hmm it just hasn't but just pull that across this will end up being shadowed I think today will do it painting it oh it has some snow in it and this will end up being some shadows yeah very gently very gently I'm just gonna blend this entire sky together just blend it very lightly this just takes out the brushstrokes but you don't want to kill all the little patterns that you have up in the sky that that's what ends up being the interesting part of okay so you've got this duo I'll clean this brush and we clean our brushes with odorless paint thinner and I really recommend you use odorless thinner or you'll be working by yourself your spouse who run you right out of the house shake off the excess I have a box down here I shake the brush into them and that's that's really the most fun of this whole technique is just raising cane with that brush of course it's also one of the best ways to redecorate your whole room if you're not careful try to try to contain that part of it I'm going to take a big old round brush here and go right into some titanium white we'll just pull it through there and load it up load it up a lot of paint okay let's cook to the canvas maybe there's a big happy cloud that lives in this painting and he lives right there see just just work at brush let this old cloud just float around the sky that it have fun mmm there we go don't stay in one place continually keep the brush moving continually keep it moving there if you stay in one place and just cry in this coloring all you're gonna have is well you gonna look like big cotton balls up in this guy now we'll take this big brush just very gently blend the bottom of it just blend the bottom of it if you pay me with a specific before in this series I'm gonna introduce you to something some new brushes and some new equipment I think you're really enjoy there we go now I'll be just brush a little and I just takes off the excess paint then we're gonna fluff these clouds look at there look at this okay close up all those beautiful little stringy things and don't worry if you pull up big stringy things here because when we blend this they all go away and they end up being the nice saw fuzzy edges of your clouds see there okay maybe you want time maybe you want several layers of clouds in your painting can do easy just load a little more paint come right in here and drop in another happy little cloud and in your painting you put as many clouds as you want she has drop them in and clouds are very free they may be one of the freest things in nature they just sort of float around and have fun all day and think about that when you're painting make how free clouds are paint your clouds at the same way give them that feeling of looseness of freedom James let him go there okay now then maybe maybe back here let's have some little background trees and live all back in here I've got several of each brush going so I don't have to spend all my time washing the brush I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyck Brown and I'm just gonna tap this pressure right in some Brown and right into the sienna back and forth here we just sort of mix them on the brush see really get in there and tap that son of a gun work it hard alright let's go up here yeah they have an ad right here there's a happy little tree there it goes it goes right on up now notice here I've started at the bottom and worked upward that way it's darker at the bottom than theirs at the top so you have the illusion of dark shadows down at the bottom okay just put in some very basic little shapes you're not looking for you know looking for distinct shapes at this time later on we'll begin worrying about very distinct shapes right now we're just blocking in maybe here lives what oh look a here he's a little taller a little bit taller there we go see how simple that is but keep the dark color down here at the base and this is this is really what makes it fun you sorta this would let these things go we have another little tree right here keep it very dark at the bottom and begin forming some basic shapes very big very basic oh my gosh I got to talk in there and my little tree turned into a big tree we may have to nail another canvas on top because we have enough room to cover all this we'll give him a little friend here too and some up here maybe that are very light very light very light just barely can to see some of them look at that and then a super weight to throw in some happy little background trees there we go and I have it tell you what I set that brace down and I'm gonna get a number two script liner brush and go into a little bit of paint thinner and right into my dark color here this is just the Browns turning that brush you want this paint to be just like water very very thin very thin turn it and pull it out that'll bring it to a beautiful sharp point okay let's go up to the canvas now then I want to put in some indications back here of just some little tree trunks some little stems and all we do is just quickly drop them in since this paint is very thin and very wet it slides over the thicker paint this base paint is very thickened it's a very dry thick paint now the thinner paint will just slide right over look at that look at that there okay put a few in here and there wherever you want I'm just sort of just sort of take a look at your trees and decide where you think little little trunk should live and drop them in there's little indication where you back here one I think you're really going to enjoy this series on this series I'm gonna bring you a couple of special guest artists I have one guest artist that you might you might have heard of he's a fantastic painter he's one of the best painters in the country that are very proud in this series to bring you a man named Ben stall and I hope you've heard of then he is unreal he's one of the best painters in the country and he agreed to come into a demonstration for so you'll see him in this series okay tell you what let's do let's build a happy little tree trunk in this big tree and for that I'm gonna take brown on the fan brush load both sides there you can see it both sides are very full this is Van Dyck Brown let's go up to the canvas hold a brush straight into the canvas touch it as you come down add more pressure make it get bigger toward the bottom in a super super way to make a little tree trunk it's that easy it's nothing difficult about it now let's put some highlights on this we want this tree trunk to stand out and be strong I'm gonna take a little bit of my yellow over on the sienna we'll blend that together with a touch of white like so now I'm gonna take the knife and cut across and get a little roll of paint right out on the edge of the blade see there hangs go up here now then if our lights coming from the right and if you're right-handed that's normally the easiest touch give it a little pull just let it sort of bounce across there just here and there just let it bounce here there okay now I'm gonna take some weight this is almost straight titanium white because I want this edge here to really stand out this is almost straight titanium white there was a little bit of the color left on the blade but mostly white there we go yeah then you take a little bit of liquid black liquid black and take my liner brush again and I put a little paint thinner and to make it even a little bit thinner okay let's clip to the canvas here and with that we're just gonna very quickly throw in a few happy little indications of some tree limbs so all there is to it see I paints very thin and it flows absolutely flow there and however many limbs you want on your tree maybe there's one that hangs down here and there whatever and we can go right into some liquid white and go right back over and throw just a hint of some highlight here in there like maybe there's a little snow laying on top of some of these there it gives you no idea how to do that now let's put some highlights on these maybe there's a little snow that's been captured up here in the in the limbs so I'm just gonna take the old round brush here but at least little touch of yellow ochre in here and just tap in a little bit of color just like so let's tap it in okay let's go up here the canvas just barely barely gonna touch and just begin forming some of the basic tree shapes here that we want just basically us look at there see how easy that is don't overdo listen this will start working so good for you in a heartbeat you'll cover your whole tree and you don't want to kill all the beautiful dark color that you work so hard to put in there just here and there yes let's send these little things just just all in there the least little touch of the yellow cord out not much but just to kill the white all right now all I have that color on the brush here let's begin laying in some snow right here you can just use this brush there all I'm doing is laying a little color right on the canvas we'll come back and clean it up with another brush might as well use it hardly got it here though this is where we begin determining the lay of the land allow a little of that color to pull right down in there that'll end up being some nice shadow areas and back into my Browns and let's just pop a few happy little bushes look there see already that begins to create the lay of the land shows you which way the land flows maybe there's a big old bush at this right there it makes it look like as little thing it goes back into the distance there this is what helps create the illusion of distance in your painting now I'm gonna take a fan brush it's a number 6 fan brush and very lightly just gonna grab these edges and begin working on the lay of the land see how you can just pull the light color out and it makes it look like there's a shadow right there and you haven't already done a thing just like there we go there's a little bit I'll live and you can always take an add just a tiny bit more if you want your shadows to be a little more distinct and make all kinds of beautiful other things happen look at the amount of distance that we've put in here with just a few strokes you can see all the way back in there it's very soft and very gentle tell you what now if I was in a place like this I'd want to build a little cabin out here so let's have some fun today and build us a happy little cabin I'll start out with a VanDyke Brown pull it out very flat cut across we get our little roll of paint again I always get that little roll of paint let's go up here alright maybe the cabin lives yep you're right he lives it right there we'll do that back Eve there it is and then we're going to come in here and put the front in there's many many ways to paint cabins this is just one of many during the series will show you several different ways let's paint the other side we're gonna leave the roof off right now we're gonna come back later and put the roof in there say all we're looking for right now it's just just the front and amp the side there there we go that easy and let's have some boards in our cabin got little hair on there so I'll just pull him off yeah we'll take some white some of that dark see you and a little little tiniest little touch of the Prussian blue like sort of a nice warm gray color a little darker there across it a tiny little roll of paint let's go up here now now grab it and gently come across very lightly barely barely caressing the canvas let the paint break if you paint with me before this is about the same as putting snow on the mountain just about the same now to the same color so I'm going to add a little more white because I wanted to be a little light isn't the site here a tree says the lights coming from the right so very gently will decide where our site is here it's a little bit lighter came out and tell you what let's put some slabs or some boards in there I've got a little bit of brown on my knife and here all I have to do is just touch the canvas and begin laying these in and this guy that built his cabin he was about as much of a carpenter as I am it some of them are fat summer skinny Oh Kevin he's had a hard life see there but that easy and easy you get decided your cabin now and we got to put a little roof on there the guy who's living in there now he's he's a chill City he's getting cold let's go up here touch pull and bring it down look at that okay touch bring it down touch and bring it right down didn't that fantastic paddies even build a cabin who I wished it was that he using a real life there put a little snow on the other side like so and we got a cabin except I need a way to get in and out of it so right here let's put a little door little door you know take a little bit of the light color and just work around it give a little highlight tell you what tell you what let's put a window in this little cabin we'll use a little too brown then we use a smaller knife it makes nice little things it's a lot easier to get into these small areas there and let's give the indication maybe is a little glass left in the window touch give it a little pull it's a little pression blue a little pression blue just a touch don't overdo don't overdo work a little bit here like and if you wanted to use a little tiny edge here a little chimney use a touch of a bright red not much it's very strong put a little red on there maybe nobody's home today there a little bit of snow on the roof okay let's have some fun now we got us a little cabin I'm gonna grab the bottom here and begin pulling this out helping to create some shadows once again there we go now maybe maybe I'm gonna tell you what I'm the world's worst lawn keeper and I believe this guy probably was too let's go up here maybe maybe he didn't cut his lawn and there's a huge big weed lives right here in front of his house that comes right on down wherever we wanted to go yes sir he takes care of a lawn about like I do I get more trouble about that there we go just put some happy little weeds here in there don't tell you what we'll take some of the spray on without flaps cut across get that little roll okay maybe there's a happy little fence a little snow fence type thing and it lives right there yeah super easy way to make a beautiful little fence maybe they're sort of falling down I'm gonna take a little bit of light color cuz it just sort of the brown and the white just touch touch a little tiny bit of the blues in there to makes it look a little bit colder there we go just drop it in yeah with a small digital knife just gonna go along here and just barely barely touch put the indication maybe the little bit of snow that's laying up here on top of them look at that now right into the liquid white and I'm gonna cut across it with a knife and this is use a heel a knife and we'll put a little bit of wire hanging on there look at that look at that that's easy look at there I used to use a one hairbrush and work myself at death trying to put water on there we try to show you the easy way of doing things use the old fan brush we'll pop a few weeds up around here and maybe there's a few coming down here wherever alone go this is just a fun little painting we go back with a little with white and I want to grab some of this brown and turn it into shadow cause it's a little darker back behind there and just let this work let it work let it play see look at all the beautiful little effects and once again this is the way this is the way that you create the lay of the land look at that little bit right there Mike coz the Sun would hit right here in mama in my mind it would strike right turn to be a little bit brighter yeah well put a little bit right into this here and you can't make a mistake with this if you put a weed in here that you don't like you just turn it into shadows it's that easy there was gone just thank her a little light would hit let your fan brush just pull it right across there and sparkle and have fun now hmm brighten that with a bright tear a little baby maybe yep right here it's another big old and each one of these represents another plane in your painting it makes it deeper and each plane really helps it really helps make the painting look like it has more depth there we go let's drop in a happy little shadow right in here there it is wherever you want them you pop them up yeah then I'm gonna take a little bit of paint thinner on my liner brush go into my brown bring it to a nice sharp point okay so up here maybe there's a few happy little sticks and twigs that live around here this is also a super super easy way to make little beach scenes here we want to paint the ocean with a happy little beach this works very very well the same principles you know what I'll let you let's take bit the soulful ahead our fence out here one time and it might be a little bit of it left right there it's just about fell down but there's still a couple of them Oh tell you what right there right there this one has really fell over hard life and then take a little bit of white touch of the yellow ocher in it and I'll just put the least little indication of some highlight on that just like so maybe maybe there one old post still turning on one rail right there one rail there it is yeah then we'll take the fan brush and just pop up some happy little things right around the foots here see now we can begin maybe bukka there this is where you go in and put in a few little finishing touches see each different little layer you put inside of this helps create the illusion of distance again I know you're probably tired of hearing me say that right now but it really is what makes paintings interesting it's the fact that they have depth to them but they're not just flat you're working with a two-dimensional surface trying to make a three-dimensional painting so you have to use illusions light against dark dark against light continually that's what makes it work that's what makes your painting pretty I'll put a few these little weed things here they come right over the top just like so and you can do a few of these using a little of the liquid white to see how they stand out against the dark that easy look they're beautiful beautiful beautiful that simple and I think we're right on the verge of having a finished painting I'm gonna take a little the thin oil and go right into my bright red I like oil because it's very slick you can use thinner but oil to me works a little nicer turn it let's go up here and we'll sign this when I sign it right here and I certainly hope you've enjoyed this painting it's been a lot of fun I look forward to seeing you in the very near future for the next show and hope you become a regular viewer with us and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless Oh you
