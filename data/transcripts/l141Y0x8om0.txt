welcome back you ready to do a fantastic painting with me well last week I promised us that we would do the painting that you see animated at the beginning of each show so I've taken the liberty of going ahead and covering the canvas with paint we're using a black canvas today it has been painted with a flat black acrylic and allowed to dry completely on top of that I have one area right here of alizarin crimson and over in here I just put a little bit of crimson somewhere just so we'll have a little bit of pinkish color in the sky the rest of the canvas is covered with a mixture of about equal parts of phthalo green and alizarin crimson it makes a very beautiful grey color so that's what we have the canvas covered with don't allow this to dry now before you start you want this wet okay let's start with a one-inch brush and we'll go right into a little bit of CAD yellow and load quite a bit of paint on the brush here we're going to start out by making the little glow that you see in the sky which ends up being the glow around the lighthouse so go right up in here where you just wherever you want the little glow to be and start making little X's just very gently and work around in a circle like so you want to get darker and darker and darker as it goes out from the center there we go there now you can make this as bright as you want it all you need to do is clean the brush each time you never want to go back into the center area with a dirty brush so I'll go back into the CAD yellow and then go right back in here and add a little bit more of the yellow make it as bright as you want it one thing I'd suggest when you're doing these at home you might make this a little bit brighter when you paint it then you want it to be when it's dry as it dries it's going to lose a little bit of the brightness so make it a tiny bit brighter than you really want it to be all right now we can take the large brush and still making the little crisscross strokes very gently blend this out leave a nice spot of yellow right here in the center and that's where we'll put the lighthouse there we go just blend it out and then very gently we can just hypnotize that just to put a little glow in the sky okay now let me clean the old brush shake it off and redecorate the studio now let's take a little bit of white this is just titanium white there's going to be a moon in this painting so let's go right up in here and put a little black background color in and we're just just making little X's little criss-cross strokes there I want it to get too bright just enough so it stands out a little bit now we can take the large brush and very gently blend that together and take out the brushstrokes okay now we can start having some fun I'll get this brush cleaned up let's do a little finger painting here I'll just take my finger and let's see the moon is right there just take titanium white on your finger then just make a little circle up here in the sky there ain't that easy now with a large brush very gently three hairs and some air let's just very lightly go across it we don't want to destroy it by now there's three layers of paint there so be very gentle now let's take the fan brush and go right into a little bit of white and all we need is a small amount on on the brush for this color stands out so strong and we'll just go right up in here and begin putting in some happy little cloud shapes now this will not be an exact duplicate of what you see at the beginning of the show because it's almost impossible to to make an exact duplicate just want to show you how that one was made in at home you can just make all kinds of beautiful little things these black canvases really are fantastic they're some very basic little shapes and maybe maybe right here is a happy little cloud it just sort of floats around here I'm using just the corner of the fan brush just let it drop right through there maybe just the corner of the brush maybe maybe there's a little little stringy cloud right there wherever you want them that's where they ought to be okay now let's take the large brush be sure it's good and dry and I want to very gently wind the bottom of this cloud out just like we're making clouds on white canvas there we go and then we'll fluff it a little bit very gentle and then just brush everything out in that something you never believe the sky could be made that easy mm-hmm that went so well us let's drop another happy little cloud right in here let me just let him work right around now here it's beginning to pick up a little bit of that crimson color that I put in so it'll be a little bit different color just give us some variation so they're not all exactly the same color and we just let this one float on and on wherever it wants to go blend the bottom of it out just using the corner of the brush there and we can fluff it up and then gently gently blend it okay now maybe maybe we'll just get crazy and put a few little stringy clouds in here little little skinny clouds and you just put them in like so wherever you want maybe there's another little in lives right there maybe just one back here then all we do is brush these pastes break it up a little okay I think now we're ready to start putting some water in here hands will take titanium white and to that I'm going to add a small small amount of CAD yellow just a little bit don't need much Tiny's little bit now let's decide where our water land is going to be here let's see it's right about there and we'll just make a basic line going all the way across the canvas so you know something like so okay there it goes just riding across and try to keep this fairly straight don't let it get too crooked on you it'll bother you via water run right out of the painting you left a bucket on one side to catch it there we go and sometimes when you're doing this step back from the canvas and look it's very hard to see when you're up close so just step back and take a look you'll see it from a whole different angle and you can see the entire painting much better it'll help you a great deal when you're at home doing all these fantastic pictures and I'm just touching the canvas I have a small amount of paint on the blade and just touching the canvas allowing the canvas to pull off what it wants let the canvas do the work now we take a large brush and very gently we're just going to blend all this together just very gently and if you want it to get a little darker you just continue to blend you can finally blend it till it's very very dark we don't want to lose all this last color that we put in there so I'm going to stop about here okay now I'm going to add a tiny bit of magic white to my paint just to thin it a little bit and we can begin working on some some very basic little wave structures here and let's go back in here and just barely touch the canvas just barely touch now one of the shows earlier we did a seascape that was all in blue that's a good exercise before you start this one it'll give you confidence this one's a little more complicated than the other one we did just because there's a little bit more in it but a little highlight up here on this wave there we go and just let that go right on out true world so you decide where it's going maybe a little more highlight right there my guy one standout a little he's got a little light coming from the moon into it and we just let that disappear right on into the background and some little things happening to all down in here and just let the fan brush sort of just drift around the canvas and have fun just wherever you think light would strike the water and there's another little happy wave it right there there he is okay just pull down word and if you ever make one up here that you don't like all you have to do is just blend it right into the canvas it's no biggie easy to fix one thing is so fantastic about this technique there are no such things as errors while we do it we have happy accidents and we use them and it's so easy to correct in this because it canvases with you can move it change it change your mind or in the middle of a painting there we go all these little things just happen yeah I think it's about time we started worrying about our little lighthouse and we've got the glue in this guy already Saul we need to do is start worrying about the building okay so let's do that let's start with Van Dyke Brown we're gonna go right up here in the center of the glow with the brightest area touch the canvas and just pull across like so let's do that from the other side also so we get nice firm edges there that's all you have to do just touching give it a little pull now something that might help you a little bit at home put a little little Center mark right there that'll sort of give you a little guide then we'll take the small edge of the knife and we can put a little little top on this lighthouse little cap there just use a small edge really does fantastic things and that gives us a little camp right up here we can smooth it out a little bit now got to have some light in this lighthouse I'll come right underneath there and we'll just creep out a little bit of this like so and go right into the CAD yellow and we'll just lay a little bit of yellow in here just indicate a nice light the old lighthouse keepers get it going good tonight God is light burning their way huh now I have to make some more almighty decisions here let's take and go right about here and just start doing this - who using the small edge of the knife and just pull this right down there we are and just getting sort of even on each side there now we can go right in here let's get the liner brush I'll put a little bit of paint thinner on there just to thin the paint down and we can put a few little detail things in here just well put some little little indications that there's a glass here there we are gives it a little more a little more detail in there want a little rail that goes right around here so we just drop it in with a liner brush and put some post down there however many you want there we go so I got we're just about ready for the bottom of the lighthouse back to the Van Dyck Brown now start right about here and just begin to going straight down just like so it's just straight Van Dyck Brown there in there something [ __ ] build a lighthouse that fast and I know you could knew you could and let's put a little bit of highlight on that and let's use let's use Oh have that burr number with a little bit of Van Dyke Brown keep it quite dark no want it to get too bright and we touch and just sort of give it a pull like it just like so now let's put a little more highlight maybe there's a little light striking that so let's take a tiny little bit of yellow ochre and mix it right in there just to lighten the color out mixed it right in with the same color and just barely touching just let that paint just barely grab and come right on around there make it look like old stones and rocks and we can take a little bit of dark color and just really make it look old there and that's basically how we make a little lighthouse now we need some land for it to stand on I want to fall off in the water and make a big splash so we'll just have some land coming right there just like so there we go maybe make this little Peninsula that goes out the lighthouse is sitting off oh we're doing just lay it in some Van Dyke Brown here start our land okay now use a little bit of the number just delay a little highlight out here on these rocks they're like how I want them to get too bright now keep them keep them quite dark this is supposed to be a night scene okay now lighthouse keeper needs a house to live in let's give him a little house and I'm still using just Van Dyck Brown and we'll put a little thing right there to one stroke and maybe maybe that's a small one in here's a bigger house we'll give them several buildings to play with there we go all of this we can just fill in with good dark color you're not gonna see it it's very dark there now a little bit of the Umbra and we can put a little bit of highlight up here her little light striking don't overdo this just a little maybe a little bits coming right down the roof here on the other side just a tiny bit yeah let's take a little bit of white and the same gray color we used in the sky make it quite dark those color shows up so much brighter here than it does on your pallet just pull down this one house and we'll put a little thing there now on this side who really wanted dark over here almost nothing so just she has to work it in and let it get very dark it comes out a little too bright just keep working it'll mix with a color underneath and go away and maybe there's some windows out here I just put some little windows in this there maybe he's like me collected too much Junkin maybe he needs a little shed right here so we're just giving one put a little front on it soup I can't needs a dark side right here and we got the little [ __ ] that quick now let's take a fan brush and I want to use yellow ochre let's put a little bit of paint thinner with that just to thin it up a little yellow ochre and little SAP green in it to dull it load quite a bit of paint onto your brush there we go now well there's some little grassy areas it grow out here just touch Bend make the brush bend upward to create all these if it doesn't stick add a little bit more something to thin it a little paint thinner a little magic white she hosted there then it'll stick that's all there is to it then paint will stick to a thick paint yeah we can have all these little grassy areas just running right down the hill here darker darker darker darker back here let him just disappear writers they get out from behind the house dark dark dark there ok now we can go back and play in some water little magic wag firm white and we could begin making this water come right up here and hit begin splashing there you go guys make these crazy little noises they help put you in the mood and maybe there it is big ol wave right there it's coming right down through there like so do sort of wanders off and you can put a little color right here into the wave like that there we go maybe here maybe we're beginning to get a little curl just pull that up simplest nicest way I've found to make waves happens very easy without a lot of work a lot of thinking just drop it in and we can put all these little things sometimes I just run right up the wave just let them go darker darker darker over here don't too much light over here and we can take the large brush and very gently just blend these right here okay maybe maybe maybe maybe this wave is already decaying here and breaking Koosh just hitting splashing and carrying on right like that and we'll just pull him right over let him fall right up here on the shore oh he's hitting there and splashing oh there's just all kinds of beautiful little things happening there we go and maybe we're running right into the shore here maybe we can see that and let's put a let's reflect some of this sands wet we learned that on the other one so just reflect a little bit of color right down into the sand here and just pull this back see had a little bit of reflection really makes it look wet it's so easy to do on these black canvases just like so okay now let's come right back in here with some Van Dyck Brown and figure out where our lands Bobby maybe it comes down right like so let's say this will not be an exact duplicate of what's animated at the beginning of the show bizz will give you an idea of how it was painted in and you can make your own almighty picture at home you would be surprised if you knew how long it takes to animate one of these they spend a great deal of time making that little thing it only lasts a few seconds that we all enjoy at the beginning and it takes a lot of talent of a lot of fantastic people okay let's just put a little bit of grassy areas right in here there we go just drop them in wherever you think they should be okay like we're about to have us a lighthouse here if you really want to get technical now we go back to put maybe a little chimney right up here on this house how do you put that in somebody would write and say you didn't put a champion there he's freezing to death right there on television okay I think we're about ready for a little signature cleaning up my liner brush a little bit of the thin oil a little permanent red just work it till it's almost like water very thin and we can go right in here and put us a nice little signature it's good to have a short name really helps when you're signing paintings maybe a little little touch more oil now next week we're going to be doing a white canvas so if you're painting along with this heavy canvas on easel be ready to go and we'll do a fantastic painting together now get this signed I think we have a completed painting here I think I've mentioned to you before but if you have questions or comments please feel free to drop us a line we'll try very hard to answer any question that we get well almost any question so from all of us here we'd like to wish each and every one of you happy painting have a super day god bless you
