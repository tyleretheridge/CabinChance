ah hi I'm certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting this is such a super day let's do a super little painting I thought today we'll do something that's very simple we'll use a limited palette and I think you'll enjoy it I have a black canvas up here today as you can see and we make these black canvases by coating them with a black gesso and that just turns it nice and black and it's all ready to go on top of that I've added a thin even coat all over the canvas of SAP green then around the edges here on the four corners I've put just a little touch of Van Dyck Brown so so the corner is a little darker okay let's just have some fun I thought today may we do a little scene let's do a little a swamp like scene you know where you have a lot of trees in the background that you can't really define but they're just there let's just do it what the heck I want to use a fan brush a lot to be by the time you do this painting you'll be an expert with the old fan brush so let's just take a small small amount of the CAD yellow just a small amount don't need much paint and just a little on the bristles okay now as I mentioned earlier we have the SAP green up here now let's have them run all the colors across the screen so you'll know what I'm doing here while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started almost forgot to tell you the colors today you'd a bit upset with me now using just the corner of the fan brush I just want to take and barely touching the canvas and just begin all we're doing here is just sort of rubbing just rubbing there I just began creating some basic little tree and blue shapes here and we're just looking for very basic little shapes let the bristles sort of lube and there these are far away and we're not looking for a lot of detail if they get they get a little too bright we can take the large brush and just rub them and they'll go away there but this is continually mixing with a green this underneath so you get all these beautiful dark misty looking colors I like to do these kind little scenes all right just a little touch more yellow and we just continually continually sort of look them just sort of hung out these little rascals there and maybe there's one we'ii back here it's just really barely can see these black canvases are so fantastic if you've never done one they can be some of the most exciting things in this whole technique there we go see there with very little effort already you're beginning to see just all kinds of little things back here a little happy Thanks it's all kind of little creatures live back here they're little squirrels and rabbits and if this was in Florida Georgia somewhere down there might be an alligator to hid back here and as a kid I had a pet alligator I don't know if you ever make a pet out of an alligator but I had an alligator to live with me let's put it that way and I fed him every day and every day he bit me hmm one thing about how JEWS I don't think you can ever make a pet out of I finally turned him loose and he still wanted to bite me there we go just using the old corner of the fan brush that's all we're doing and we can make the indication just tons and tons of trees and bushes then we're gonna put some things in front of these so keep these pretty dark when you're doing yours don't I don't get too bright on you against this black canvas color stands out so strong very quickly and get too bright and once again should that happen just take your large brush in very gently just go over to it'll dull the color because it'll mix with that green is underneath there we go so say I was born and raised in Florida and I was born in Daytona Beach and lived around Orlando most Amala and back in those days people thought Orlando would would never amount to anything but just a swamp and that's one of those fantastic cities in Florida in Disneyworld is there and a super place to go now there you know my mother still lives there shoes she likes it there she likes these kind of scenes too there we go I'm just falling on here just however many bushes and trees that you want in your world just drop on them just want you to see how easy it is to do this just using a fan brush and all we're doing is using the corner and just sort of scrubbing it and when you push that's where those highlights come from can you see how that works when you push upward there you go that's where it happens there and maybe down in here there's some little ones has to be little bushes if it's gonna be big bushes here we go mmm you can zoom the rascals maybe and that one right in it you just make the decision this is your world and you have to decide where everything is in it King Mandan see once again if you wanted to dull this down if it was a little too bright for you just take your large brush and one harrods of air you're just barely touching it and just go over it just like so just very barely caress it and you can bring us all together there and the more you do this the darker it'll become because once again is picking up that color that's underneath and you're blending them together there okay and then we could take our liner brush go into a little paint thinner now I'm going to a touch of the little touch of the Van Dyck Brown and just mix this until it's almost like ink it's very very thin very thin turn that brush this liner brush has long bristles holds a lot of pain in those bristles okay now then herring they're just sort of look at it and put in an indication of just a few little little domes and sticks and all kinds of happy little things that have happened here you need some trunks for some of these little trees and stuff some of them you can't see they're just here in there wherever you want that's fantastic and create a whole swamp whole forest that easy this does not necessarily have to be a swamp it could be a beautiful forest out here and you'd have basically the same effect there just drop them in and if you have trouble making this paint flow add a little more of the paint thinner this then paint will just literally slide right over the canvas but if it it's not working chances are chances are you don't have quiet enough paint there into your paint so just add a little too then take some Van Dyck Brown lute darks and there too let's just pull it out very flat here on the palate so to mix it together you have a little white and throw in there too so we get land egg Browns dark sienna and a little plate pull it out very flat and cut across to get that little of pay no knife that literal of paint or really pay your big dividends now there to sort of look at your your painting here and decide where there would be some land and maybe the land lives right in there wherever you want your favor I go and all we're doing here is just sort of scrubbing this song there look at all the little rascals all kinds little things happen little red cones and the old possum's and stuff all live up in here now you've got to have a little place to sit here but all the water birds come and catch my meadow and it helps when you're doing these kind of things make up little stories in your mind tell you what maybe under here let's put a few little reflections now that we have our land areas to find so I'll just take a little yellow on the brush madan decide where your reflections are going to be into the water grab it and pull straight down and get a little let Brown add to it this usually if it's a swampy area it's not very deep it's very shallow so you get a lot of mud and if you want to highlight that it was when you take a little touch of the titanium white to sparkle it not much though get too bright on you there tip too bright too quick now very lightly come across see the instant reflections okay so on the other side I get a little touch more of the yellow and let's go right over here and just drop those in that easy we pull straight down you're doing these reflections be sure you pull them straight down most important they come straight down Oh green water boy that's pretty I like just to live with algae all kinds of creatures this is where this is where the whole ecology over ecosystem starts is right here in these little swamps there man like some land masses there we go if this is your first time painting in this technique these little black cameras just try one of them I think you'll find that they work so well oh they'll get you hooked it works oh well you just you get hooked on this and it's easy to do it's easy do we tell people sometime we're like we're like drug dealers we we come into town and get people absolutely addicted to painting if it doesn't take too much to get you addicted here I've had a little white - my coloring just highlight here in there because painting is fun it's it does nice things to you it doesn't hurt anybody everybody's happy it brings a lot of joy to people with you whether you're doing the painting or whether you give your paintings or sell your paintings to other people that makes them happy and we need more of that little war the yellow here just same ol yellow back on the fan brush and just but not much paint not too much paint now that let's bring some happy little bushes just use a corner of the brush it will bring some little bushes that live right out here and come right on down like yeah see you there they are and just wiggle that brush see they don't come right on down to the land there they go there this is one of the simple and effective ways I've ever seen for making a lot of happy little Bush areas and it works look at that see how deep it looks back in there warn us there's a booger hides back in there I'll tell you yes sir that's there was a big alligator lives in there he had hide back in there there we go just put in some little pushes maybe there's one lives right there wherever you want there is one how are you doing this just sort of wiggling the brush just wiggle the brace let these things just sort of happen people write and tell me sometimes they they Sam I got a little nervous twitching I can't paint if you have if you have a little shaky hands you're ahead of the rest of us here it will really help you I talk too much let me paint hair let's take some yellow a little bit of kit in yellow and I'm just go and get that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife okay now then let's just take that and just sort of here and there put in some happy little water lines now all I'm doing is touching the canvas just touch the canvas canvas will pull off what it wants just touch there see maybe there's some thanks Lee and I hear in the water there they are hey let's go back over here need a little touch here and here hmm fun little painting these are the kind of little paintings off the dystiny really just make you happy and if one gets too bright just rub it a little bit and it'll blend right in once again you have that color underneath that base color and you can just move things you can create all kinds of beautiful illusions I'll tell you what while I get this old knife going maybe take some more of a brown dark seems a little bit of a little bit of titanium white maybe a little touch more white yeah that's nice cut across and get our little roll of pain again I know you get tired of here maybe there's a little island floats out here so first we've just put in a little bit of a little bit of dirt we just decide where our little island lives maybe he is yep you're right right there take a little touch of the brown and white enter that well at least little touch of highlight there and let's go back to our fan brush put a little more of the yellow in it once too high you reach over here and get the least little touch of the yellow ocher just a tiny bit tiny little bit okay maybe there's a happy little Bush lives out here so let's put him in there he is just start us crabby moan and you can have as many or as few as you want now when you're putting this base color on the SAP green underneath when you put that on try to put just a thin coat you'll find this most difficult part of this painting that pain is very dry and very firms you have one big arm from scrubbing it on but just a thin coat don't don't let it too much get on there otherwise every time you put any yellow on here all that'll happen is it turns bright green on you and that's alright but sometimes you want to retain some color so just a nice thin even little coat that's all you're looking for then vector Canyon yellow on the nine if I will just add a little bit underneath here to sort of set that down in the water tell you what let's do let's put a little reflection under this that'll spark lit up a little all right how many full is straight down look at that like just a little and then come lightly across there have an instant reflection okay then we'll bring some more of these right over the top there we go super okay now maybe maybe in our world yeah let's get crazy what the heck you have to have some fun take just take your knife and maybe there's some land that lives right here just a little lamb it lives there wherever you want it right there every you wanna a little bit of a lighter color just for a touch of highlight here in there don't too much just a touch okay now then back into our yellow won't just be a little darker so I'm gonna add a little SAP green down here too I want to be a little more into the greenish color in the foreground here we'll have it a little darker a little darker tanks go back up here now then let's sort of decide and maybe yep there lives a nice happy little Bush right here just a corner the fan brush just scrub it just sort of let it bounce around play and he's got little friend here wherever there's another one see there just all kinds of little things maybe out in here or some more there you go open here there's one and these little bushes are fun to make you just won't believe how easy they just jump right off that fan brush there we go leave some dark areas in here see those little dark areas are what separates individual bushes and and creates depth and distance in that side of again tell you what let's have a big tree I'm just gonna take some Van Dyck Brown let's have some fun here Van Dyck Brown get over here and get some darks and I just loaded on the fan brush a lot of paint maybe on this little island here lives a happy tree sure does now there he is just but his trunk in let's give him a friend can you be my little friend there we go don't even get lonely and we can take I take a little touch of the white with a little tea about of dark sienna cut across get our little roll of paint and let's just put the indication of a little highlight on the side of this tree just hearing there just a little there it is see take my liner brush paint thinner on it then like ink turn them turn those bristles in there pull it out let's put the indication of a happy little tree limb here and there just a few we're gonna put some let's put some leaves on this tree it's a nice foliage I'm giving back here okay there we go now I believe we can also use the fan brush and create some nice foliage on that tree using the same basic technique go right back into my yellow load the bristles okay let's go up in here yeah decide where this side of a gun is and let's just throw on some quick little see just some little indications here and there all kinds of little leaves and lambs that live out here just using the corner of the fan brush just let that rascal just sort of shake and play shake and bake there we go let it go it's not a fantastic way making that nice little tree a little out here all right in there there and that easy we've got a nice little tree you might want to come down in here and put a little bit around the plot um of this tree and that brings it all together yeah you know me so I like those big trees so let's have a big tree over here go right into Street Van Dyke Brown and I'm going to load a roll of paint on the knife there we go you can see it okay now make a big decision if trees gonna live it's gonna live and we check you out for bravery this is your bravery test this is your bravery test a little more paint maybe that's a big band in a tree in it ah see why that trees had a ruffle life out here there we go all the creatures and stuff have climbed this tree and looked out over the swamp this old tree could talk well he could tell you some stories Jane and I will take some white white white dark sienna boat outs very flat cut across and once again that little roll of paint I know you get tired seeing if it pull it out cut across that's all there is to it and with that let's just take gentle touch if you paint with me before and put snow on the mountains this is the same thing just sort of let it break and follow that old tree right on down all right on down maybe the least little touch of we head over here reddish color would see had brightens the drive 11 huh can make a beautiful tree just using your knife now the other side just to show a little reflective light won't take the least these little touch of Prussian blue and white and almost no white in it one it very dark just to show a little reflected light and drop right on the other side here and then sort of bring them together just tapping mm-hm you can just use a little more Brown now and just work these colors together and he makes it big old tree that really looks gnarly hope that's a word gnarly you know what I mean sometimes I'm very guilty of just making the board's gnarly that's a good sounding word though okay back to my liner brushes put a few arms on this tree then paint her there we go just big alarm on that son of a gun there yes I see when I was a kid I had a pet alligator and I had all kind of weird pets you might even had an armadillo one time putting my dad's car pora in his little workshop house it tore up everything in there boy he got me armadillos strong if you don't know what an armadillo is it's when they're little creatures that live in a shell he carries his little house around with him there we go they're all over the south just harmless and cute as they can be they're got a few little limbs out there and maybe maybe maybe maybe go back to a fan brush let's load some more of the catnip yellow a little touch of the yellow ocher and let's go back up here and let's put a few happy little leaves out here on this tree still just rub it in and scrub it so all we're doing no pressure hardly just barely barely barely better with the brush touch the canvas just any sort of Grey's sledding fair and touch and have fun yeah all kinds of happy little things and in your world you decide I mean leaves and bushes and stuff there and drop them in maybe it's a few out here and this old limit maybe hit maybe it's dead shoot it's its rest in it I'll tell you what I think we have a painting it's about ready for a signature let's take a little bit of red and let's sign this little painting will sign it right down here I certainly hope you've enjoyed it it'll show you some fantastic ways of using the black gesso and I know that you'll have fun doing it so until next time from all of us here happy painting and God bless you you
