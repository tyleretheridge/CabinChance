- Welcome back. So glad you can join us again today. Today I thought we'd do a
fantastic little seascape. This is a very simple little painting. It's quite easy to do and I think it'll stir your imagination and lead you onto bigger
and better things. And I've taken the liberty of going ahead and covering the canvas with
a layer of prussian blue, a very firm paint. Don't use a paint that's oily or slick. It's a very firm, dry paint. On the bottom, I've added a
little bit of phthalo green. And a little bit of van dyke brown right over here in the corner. So with that, let's get started. We'll take off here with a one inch brush. And I'm going to take a
little bit of titanium white, just a small amount on the brush. One thing you'll notice on black canvas, color shows up much brighter than it does on a white canvas. Let's just go right up in here and just create a little light area right in here somewhere. There we go. And just making little x's. Just brush it like that. Just so we have a light source back here. And now you can begin to see how the white is picking
up the blue undercolor and it shows up. With a large brush, I'm
just going to blend this. Just very gently blend it all together. And we talk about a firm paint, but if you were using a thin paint here when you tried to blend you'd become a mud mixer. So use a very firm dry paint. Now maybe we'll put a little moon up here. We can do some finger painting. I'll just take a finger here and go right up to where you want the moon and just push in a little circle. That's all. Just a little circle. Like that. And then we'll take the large brush and very gently just blend this. Once again, paint's firm so
you can do all this blending. There we go. Ain't that easy? You have a little moon in the sky. Now let's start with a fan brush and we can put some happy
little clouds in the sky. I'm going to load some titanium white and you don't need too
much paint this time because once again, color
shows up so bright here. And we'll just take and maybe
come right down here like this and just begin making all
these pretty little things. Just let this sort of disappear. And we can add a little
more color back up in here Just white. Just white paint. There. Maybe a little tiny bit in here. And just let it gently
get darker and darker as it gets away from the moon. Up in here, maybe there's
another happy cloud that floats around, lives right here. There we go. Now let's take and maybe right here. This is your world so you can put clouds
wherever you want 'em. Maybe right there. Right there, I see a cloud. You see these things in your mind and you put 'em on canvas. There we go. Maybe there's another little one just sort of hides right in here. There we are. Okay, now. We go back to the large brush and this is where we
find out if you're brave. Very gently just blend it all together. And you can keep blending it until it gets darker and darker and darker and it'll finally go away
if you blend it enough. So you have to make an
almighty decision here. When it gets to the
point you like it, stop. Don't piddle it to death. The areas closest to the
moon should be the brightest and as they get farther away from the moon let 'em get darker and darker and darker. If you want something darker, once again, just blend it more. There we are. Isn't that a super, super simple nice way to make a little sky? Okay, let me wash the brush. We wash the brush with
odorless paint thinner. And when you're doing this at home rig up a box or something to contain it. Otherwise, you're gonna
redecorate your house in a second. Alrighty, now. Let's take the palette knife and we'll take a little
bit of titanium white. Very, very small amount of paint. And we'll figure out here where
the water line's gonna be. And just very gently
begin touching the canvas. Now you want this to be pretty straight. You don't want your water to
run off one side of the canvas. You have to hang a bucket
over there to catch it. So try to keep it pretty straight
as it comes across there. There we go. And maybe right under the moon here we're gonna have some light
reflecting in the water. So we can just take and do this. I'm pushing very, very hard just to push the color
right into the canvas. Just let this come all the way down. There. And we can drop a few more
little things back in here. All I'm doing is touching the canvas. Just touch it. And start in the lightest
area and work out and automatically it'll
get darker as it goes out from the light source. You don't have to worry about it or think about it. We make all these big decisions, they're done for you. Let the paint work. Let the canvas work for you. You can see now how it's
picking up the prussian blue and a little phthalo green? Very pretty. All we're doing is just touching. You know, we get so many cards and letters from people who are watching the shows and one of 'em one of the big things that we're hearing is people want seascapes
like they have in Florida. We have a lot of super friends in Florida. So this little seascape is for them. And Florida is one of our favorite places. My mother lives in Florida. I was originally born
and raised in Florida and moved to Alaska. And my mother and I have a brother
who still lives there. There we go. Now, once again, we'll
take the large brush and all we're going to do is
just very gently blend this in. We're using pretty firm pressure here. We can really push. This paint's dry. We can push it and move it around without destroying everything. There we go. And already we have the light
shining through the water. Then we can begin working
on details in that water. Okay. I'm gonna add a little bit of
magic white to my fan brush just to make the paint
a little bit thinner. Tiny bit thinner. Load quite a bit of paint into the brush and we can begin working on some individual waves and stuff here. And we just barely touch the canvas. We don't want big waves
back here in the distance. We want 'em to get bigger
as they come forward. Just barely touch it and
give it a little pull just like that. There you go. Now a super simple little
way to make some nice waves. I knew you could do it. Very simple. Little things happening in
the water here and there. Just let the fan brush play. Just let it play and have fun. Wherever you think
there ought to be a wave that's where it should be. There we go. Now as we come forward we want to start lettin' these waves get a little bit bigger. Maybe right up in here we'll put some beach in here. So let's put a big wave right in here. Just let it go there. There we are. Okay, now. Now once again right
under our light source we want this to be bright. So start here. Like that. There we go, see? Automatically, it gets darker as you get farther away from it. Over in here, it's getting very dark. And maybe this wave comes up here. Maybe it's gettin'
ready to start breaking. Put a little more curl in it right here. You can just use your
brush to make the strokes to give you any effect that you want. Maybe it's just beginning to curl over. Boom. All you have to do is just take your brush and bend
it so it bends upward. And then grab the top
and reverse the angle. Pull it over. So that wave's comin'
up this way and turns. There we go. In here, we can just add a few little little highlights on the water just where the light's
playing through here. Don't want 'em to get too bright. Now we can take a good
dry clean brush here and very gently just blend this right out. Just blend it so it just fades
right into the background. Very gently. Three hairs and some air. And we can begin pulling this down, and working on some shapes. There. Little things happenin' in the
water, some little foamies. Okay. We almost have our big
large wave finished here. And if you wanna increase
the highlight just a touch, pull it down. Okay now. Maybe, maybe we have a
little beach up here. I wanna spend some time
working on this beach. Now we can take the fan brush and just put us some basic shapes in here. We're not too worried about anything now. We're just puttin' some
color on the canvas. And with a clean, dry brush I wanna grab this and pull it down. I want reflections of this. I want this to look like sand. Wet sand. Just pull it down. And then we'll go gently across it. It'll give the illusion of water, of very wet sand or something there. And we can go back and once again we'll put in the little foam things that are happening right along in here. And just sort of let 'em blend backwards. There we go. Now just sort of pull this back. There. Now isn't this the most
fantastic little thing you've ever seen? It's a super easy way to do a
nice, very effective seascape. There, we just add a little bit of white and put us some little things in here. There we go. And just let your imagination
take you where you wanna be. There. As I say, I was born and raised in Florida and then later on in life, I
moved to Fairbanks, Alaska. What a contrast. Alaska's one of the most
beautiful countries in the world. You have so many fantastic
things to look at. Now I want this side here
just to fade into nothing. Very lightly. There. Brighten that a little bit. I want that to be a little brighter. It's right under the moon. There we go. Touch and pull down to create
our little wave actions. Okay now with a large brush once again I'm just gonna
very gently grab it. Just blend everything out
so it's nice and quiet. There. And you can do this blending
all the way across the painting and make it as quiet as you want it. Okay, let's wash the old brush. Now if you wanna make these
little areas right along in here stand out a little bit more we'll take a number
two script liner brush. I'll put a little bit of thinner on it and I'm gonna go right
into a little bit of brown. Just make it very, very thin like water and turn that brush, twist it, so it comes to a nice sharp point. And just underneath the edges here add a litlte bit of brown. That'll sort of project everything up. Just pushes it out. Just on the areas where
you'd see it on this side. Don't worry about back there. There we go. Then once again we can gently blend that all in so it's nice and quiet. And let's wash the old liner brush. Now, let's take, maybe there's
a little stone layin' here on the beach. And I'll use a small edge of the knife and we'll just put a happy
little stone right here. Just a little one. And we'll take a little
bit of burnt umber, just a little burnt
umber, and go right back and lay a little highlight on that stone. Just a little light playin' through there. And maybe a little underneath. Then we can take a one inch brush, grab ahold of just the
bottom and pull down. We want that stone to
reflect into the wet sand. And then come across. Just come across the reflection. We don't wanna touch our stone yet. Okay, now we'll use a little
bit of magic white on the knife and we'll put like it's water
standing around the stone. Just a little. Just let it work right around. And if you put one in
here that's too bright all you have to do is just keep rubbing it and it'll pick up the
blue that's underneath and dull it right down for you. There we go. In this painting, we use
such a limited palette. There are so few colors used here. Now maybe maybe, maybe you can, if this is in Florida,
we need a palm tree. I got to have a palm tree so maybe there's a big palm tree
right out through here. We'll just start here with a little bit of the van dyke brown. Pull it out very flat. Get a small rule of paint on the knife and maybe they're just comin' from right off the side of the canvas here. And we just barely touching the canvas. Just let it go up like that. Now we can do the other side of the tree. Just do one side at a time. And when you do these you want 'em to get smaller as they go up. I know that sounds crazy, but sometimes it's a little hard to do. Just want 'em to get
smaller toward the top. There. Now we got us a basic trunk in. In palm trees and like everything else, they get lonely too so let's give him a friend. Maybe there's one, oh he just
bends all around like that. Comes way out through here. You know when you're painting these, make up little stories,
sort of helps you go along. Just capture a dream in your mind, put it on canvas before it escapes. And painting should make you happy. It should always make you happy. And if painting teaches you nothing else, it'll teach you to look at nature to see the fantastic beauty
that surround us every day. That we take for granted,
take a little time, stop and look at it, there. It's a million, million things to paint. All you have to do is look around. And we'll try to show
you how to paint them. What you paint is up to you, okay. Now we got us a basic
little trunk right there. Let's take a little bit of white, and we'll make a gray color here. Now I've made this gray color
by mixing about equal amounts of phthalo green, and alizarin crimson. Phthalo green and alizarin crimson. Makes a beautiful,
beautiful gray, a true gray. Now we can put a little
highlight on these trunks, and all we're going to do
is just touch the canvas, just touch it, let the canvas
pull off what it wants. You don't have to make any decisions. Looks like the hurricane come through and blew the top of those off. There. When I was a boy being raised in Florida, it was not unusual to have
some big hurricanes, woo, goodness gracious, they would
blow you around for days. There we go, just touch, all
you have to do is just touch. It's just gray and white,
just let that follow right up the tree, there. Okay, I think we're about
ready to put some leaves on this big ole' tree. Now I'm gonna take a
little bit of paint thinner on my fan brush, and go right
into this same gray color. But I want it very thin, very thin. And I'm just using paint thinner. We'll add a touch more there, there we go. And you have to make an almighty decision. Which one of these trees is in the front, and which one's in the back? Maybe the little ones in the back, so we'll do him first, all
you have to do is just touch, and then take the fan
brush with this thin paint, and pull, just pull real
quick, just snap it. Just snap it, and it'll
make all the little leaves that you have on the palm trees. Okay, now let's go, maybe
there's another happy little limb right there, and we
give him a little pull. Just like so, just touch and pull. And maybe there's a little
one that comes right out here. Like that, touch and pull. Now this one's sorta
comin' right toward ya, so maybe you can see both sides of him, so put a little bit on the other side too. Don't want all the little leaves on one side of the palm limb, just let it come right on down, both sides. And right up here, maybe there's one that goes up, and sort of turns. I'm going to put some
limbs right here, there. Very thin paint though, very, very thin. And one more right there, touch, pull. Just sort of snap the brush. And you can put as many
leaves on your palm tree as you want, I'm just gonna put a few to show you how to do
'em, and then at home, you can just, oh you can just do anything, because you have unlimited time. Just have a nice big limb
that comes out right there. Touch, and pull. Now you can really see these little leaves against the clouds in the sky. There we go, now. Maybe it comes right on back like that. There. And give him another one
right down through here. Just touch, pull. These are very loose. Okay, here's a little one up here. Maybe there's just a little
one growing right there. There we go, like so. We'll put a little bit on the other side. Maybe there's another one
right there, right there. And we'll put one more that's sort of going across the trunk. Don't have all the limbs
just going on either side, have some actually go across the trunk. Makes it look a little more realistic. Now I'm gonna take the same gray color, and go into a lighter gray,
just a tiny, tiny bit. Just want to make these stand out, because I really want to
keep these silhouetted as much as possible,
and just barely touch, and just the least little indication of highlight on there, don't overdo. Very easy to overdo. And you have to sort
of figure out where the center of the limb is
here, the vein that goes through the center, just touch like that. There we go, there's one. Just barely touch, follow
the angles that you have in your original limbs, yeah. There we are. And I think this will give
all of our friends in Florida, and anywhere else they
want to paint a seascape an idea of how to do a
fantastic little seascape that works so easy, and
then make you happy. There, just like that. Now, maybe, maybe... Going right back into
this same gray color, and I'm using the liner brush this time. Maybe we'll just put a few little indications of things down here. There we are, just a little sea oats or something is growing
right down in here. Just take your fan brush and drop 'em in. There I said fan brush,
I meant liner brush. And when you're at home painting, you can put a lot more
detail, you can put a little beach in here, okay. Let's take, and just use
the liner brush here, and we'll put some little
tops on some of these, make them look like little sea oats. There, that's all there is to it. Knew you could do it. And something like so. I think we have a painting here, that's just about ready for a signature. So, I'll go into a thin oil,
and any kind of thin oil will work, at home you
could use like linseed oil, or copal, or any type of
oil that's nice and thin. You want to take and work that brush until the paint's almost
like water, turn it. To bring ya a nice sharp edge here. Just turn it, and then we
can sneak right up in here, and put a signature on it. That's when you're almost
ready to stand back and admire. Now when you're doing these
black canvases at home, view 'em under several different lights. It's unbelievable what
happens when you change the light sources, these
paintings are almost like having two in one, now next
week we'll use a white canvas, so if you're painting along
with us, have your canvas ready, your easel setup, and we'll do a fantastic painting together. Until then, from all of us here, happy painting, God bless. (smooth soft rock)
