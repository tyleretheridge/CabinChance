- Welcome back, I'm awful
glad to see you today. Today, let's do something
that's bright and shiny that'll put you in a good mood and do nice things in your heart here. I'm gonnna have them
graphically run all the colors across the screen that we'll
use to do the painting today. They'll come across your
screen in the same order that I have them on my palette, starting with the white and coming around. While they're doing
that, let's get started. I've already covered the
canvas with a thin even coat of Magic White and we're ready to go. Today, I'm gonna start with a little tiny bit of Indian Yellow. We'll just put a little bit on
a two-and-a-half inch brush. Now, let's go right up here in the sky. We'll start making little "Xs," little tiny "Xs." You don't need much color, and it blends with the Magic White, and gets lighter in value
as you blend outward. Let's take some of it right down. It's a beautiful, beautiful color, and it's very transparent. Indian Yellow is a transparent yellow. Now then, without washing the brush, I'm gonna take and go
right into a small amount of Alizarin Crimson
without washing the brush. We'll go right above that, and let's put in a little bit of crimson, a nice little pinkish color, a little more paint, and blend it very well. You want it to blend
together so you can't tell where one color stops
and the next one starts. Now, I'm gonna go into
a little bit of crimson and a little bit of Prussian Blue. A very small amount of Prussian Blue Is a hundred times
stronger than your crimson, and just brush mix it. Prussian Blue and Alizarin Crimson, a very, very small amount of blue. Now, right here, we'll put
a little lavender color. This just all blends together. Then, I'll go right into Prussian Blue, and we'll fill up the remainder of the sky with Prussian Blue. I haven't washed the brush
all the way through this, all the way through,
but you don't wanna get the blue and yellow mixed together. If you do, you'll have a bright green sky, and chances are, you
won't be happy with that. There we go. Now, while I've got the old dirty brush, I'm gonna go back into a
little crimson and blue, and maybe come right down here and lay in a little lavender color, and have a little bit of water here. I'm an absolute fanatic
for water, I love it. If it was up to me, every painting that I did
would have water in it, but sometimes, you have to do something that doesn't have water. There we go. Don't wanna lose all of our yellow, so we'll just do that for right now. Now, I'll clean the brush. We clean our brushes with
odorless paint thinner. There's a screen in the
bottom of this bucket that I scrub the brush against. You shake out the excess paint thinner, and then the fun. You just beat the devil outta that brush. Take out all your hostilities. Now, with a clean dry brush, I'm gonna blend the sky together. You can spend some time blending this. You want it to really, really
blend together beautifully. You don't wanna be able to
tell where one color stops and the next one starts. Just blend it together. You can do this several
times if necessary. Step back, take a look-see. It really pays to step away
from the painting sometimes, and look at it. Get a whole different view. I'll just bring this all the way across. Now that we have a clean brush, I'll just bring it right across. Just that easy, we have the
sky and water already finished. Now then, let's build us, let's build us a little mountain up here. I like mountains. My home's in Alaska and we have a lot of mountains in Alaska, some of the most beautiful
mountains in the world. I'm gonna take Prussian
Blue and Alizarin Crimson. You need much more crimson than blue. Once again, the blue is
a hundred times stronger. I wanna dull that so
I'm gonna reach up here and put a small amount of
Van Dyke Brown into it, so crimson, Prussian
Blue, and Van Dyke Brown. I want it to have sort of a purplish cast, so I'm using more crimson
than I normally would. If you wanna test that and
see what color it really is, take a little white and then
take a little of your color and put into it. That's really the only way you can tell. Otherwise, it just looks black in here. Okay, that gives us a pretty good color. Let's take a little bit on the fan brush. We'll use the fan brush today, and make us a mountain. Load that brush full of paint. Pull it through there, wiggle it, both sides, and then sharpen it. Look at the amount of
paint in the bristles. That's what we're looking for. Okay, let's go up here. Maybe the little mountain
lives right here. You have to make this decision, maybe, maybe right about there. We're using just the corner of the brush, wherever you want it to go. Give it some little wiggles and jiggles, and aw, just make all kinds
of beautiful little things. Maybe there's a bump,
wherever you want it. Use just the corner of the
brush, that's all you need. You're not applying a great deal of paint, just a little. Maybe it comes down and
there's a bump there, wherever. Wherever. There we go. Now, we'll take our
large brush and pull it. That removes excess
paint and blends it out. And if you can see the entire mountain, it should be more distinct at the top than it is at the bottom. This happens automatically
'cause this makes some of the color underneath, and the magic quite automatically. It gets lighter in value as
it goes toward the horizon. See there? You don't have to worry about it. The brush and the canvas,
they do it for you. You've got a basic mountain shape already. Now then, let's take another fan brush. I have several here, so I don't have to spend a
lotta time cleaning them. I'll load it full of Titanium White, and to that, I'm gonna
reach right down here and grab a little bit of Permanent Red, a small amount, a small amount. Don't wanna set it on fire. Load a lotta paint into the bristles, a lotta paint. Okay, let's go right up here. Now, you have to make some
decisions in this mountain. Which one of these peaks
is the farthest away? You wanna do the one
that's farthest away first, and work forward. Maybe I'll start over here. I'm just gonna touch and wiggle it. Just wiggle it. Just let all these little things happen, very gently. Very gently, here comes one. There it is. There it is. Move it around and it goes
right down there like that, wherever you want it to go. There. Oh, here we are. There it is there. I see it. Just visualize these things in your mind, and put 'em on the canvas. It's all there. Just let it go. Normally, we put highlights
on the mountain at night. Today, I want to show you that you can use the little fan brush, and just make all kinds
of beautiful effects. Just let 'em go. There, wherever you want this to go. Make it as wide or as small as you want. Maybe there's a little
light showing right there, maybe even a little back here, wherever. Now, I'll take a little Prussian Blue, and mix right into the white to make a shadow color. We need a shadow color. There we go. Now, let's go back up here. Once again, figure out which
one of these is farthest away, and do it first. Do the one in the back first. Now, we've done that one. Let's take a little paint and
come right down through here, and we come directly through that. It pushes that one right
into the background, that easy. Did you know you have that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. There we go. Now, each little highlight here needs its own private shadow. You just sorta look at
what you laid in here, and begin working with it. Right here, a nice area. Don't wanna kill all your darks. Maybe there's a little shadow right there. A little shadow lives right
behind that highlight. Barely, barely touching the canvas. Super, super easy little way to make very effective distant mountains. Let's go right in there, wherever you want, wherever you want. Drop down, and maybe you wanna pull this out, and on down. You can take these mountains
anywhere you wanna go. If you're not careful, you'll
get to where you like this and cover up your entire
canvas with just mountains, which is wonderful. It teaches you how to make mountains. That's the way I used to practice. I would cover an entire
canvas with mountains, and scrape it off and do it again, over and over and over. That's the way you learn is by repetition, doing things over and over. Let's take a clean dry brush, and I wanna create a little nest here, so we'll tap this, just gently, gently, gently tap all of the angles in your mountain. Then, lift upward very light, three hairs and some air, barely, barely touching, very soft, all in those angles, most, most important. Over here, we tap in this direction and lift up, very softly. It's easy to destroy but
we just wanna diffuse. Now then, we can start
playing a little bit here. This is our lavender color
that we made, purplish color, the same thing the mountains are made of. I'm gonna add a little bit
more of the blue into it, a little more blue hue. Blue hue, that's hard to say. Okay, let's go back up here. Maybe there's a few little tree lines running down the side of this mountain. Touch, using just the corner
of the brush, lift upward. These are far, far away.
We don't want detail yet. Far, far away. You have to follow the angles
that are in the mountain. If you don't, it's not gonna look right, and then you're gonna be unhappy with me, and I want you to be happy. That's what painting's all about. It does nice things to your heart. There we go. Just make it look like the tree line running up the side back here, far, far away. It's another way of creating
distance in your painting. Then, I'm gonna take a
clean dry one-inch brush, and very lightly, very
lightly, whisper-light, begin lifting up and allowing that to mix with the undercolor, so it softens it. We want it to be very
soft and very distant, and quiet. There we go. See? Isn't that a super way to make
little distant tree lines? You don't have to do hardly a thing. Just lay a little color on, lift it up, and you're in business. Painting is not only fun, it can be easy. All you need to do is learn
a few little basic rules, and go crazy. Now, we can get in here. Let's get some more good dark color. Let's just keep using the fan brush. We've used it so much today. Maybe, maybe, there it is. Make a decision. Drop it in. You have to think a minute, drop it in. Just sorta look at your painting and visualize all these
beautiful little things. Let 'em happen. Let 'em happen. Probably one of the hardest things is not how to paint, but what to paint. That's what drives most of us crazy, is sitting around trying to
figure out what to paint. I carry a camera with me
everywhere I go nearly, and with that camera, if I
see something that excites me, I take a picture of it and save it, because you can capture a second in time, and save it until you wanna use it. And from that, you can
make beautiful paintings. We'll give you the technique here, and you take what you see, 'cause everybody sees nature differently, and you paint beautiful paintings, and they'll make you happy. Okay, I'm just pulling a little bit, a little bit of this lavender color down. If you wanna make this look
like it goes back here, let this reflection be
shorter than over here. It'll give the impression
that it's round like that, and goes way back. Sneaky, huh? Now, very lightly come across, super light, super, super light, just enough to give it a watery appearance and then, leave it alone. It's very, very easy to overwork it, overwork it, and we don't wanna do that. Now then, let's put some
highlights back in here. I'm gonna take a little
bit of Permanent Red, Permanent Red here, and we'll mix it with
a little bit of yellow. This is Cad Yellow, a nice bright color, with a little Indian
Yellow thrown in there. We'll make us a beautiful, beautiful, bright, bright color here. This is almost an orange-y color. If you wanted to dull it, you could put a little
bit of brown into it. That'll dull it right down. Let's go right up here, and I'm gonna use just
the fan brush still. I just wanna tip, just
tip it here and there, put in some nice little
highlights, not too many. There we go. I'll get a little more paint
on my brush and go over here. Don't overdo these. You don't wanna kill all your darks. I just want some impressions, just like so. Begin making all kinds of
little different things here. This is where you can change the number of projections that you
have out into the water. All you have to do is grab
them and pull some down, and make you a little
reflection, and go across. I'm gonna take a little
bit of the Magic White, and put a little of that lavender color into the Magic White, very flat, very flat. Hold it as flat as you can get
it, and then cut across it. That'll give you a small roll of paint, a little line of paint right on the blade. We're gonna push right into the canvas, just like we're trying
to cut a hole through it, and lay in some nice little
waterlines back there. Keep these lines basically straight. They can go anywhere you wanna go, but they need to be straight to keep your water in the painting. There. A little bit over here, and already, you can see how it's starting to build depth into the painting. It makes it look far, far away. So many of the fast painting
techniques are very flat. We spend a lot of time and energy trying to make these paintings
have tremendous depth. Going back to the purple, plus crimson and Prussian Blue, let's put a happy little tree right there. Touch, use the corner of the brush, and give him some little arms, that easy, that easy, give him a friend. Just drop him in, just
the corner of the brush. Use the same corner of the
brush all the way through. Maybe there's some bigger
trees that live right there. Touch. Look how that color stands out against that yellow back there. It's exciting. The contrast really stands out. Maybe I can give him a little friend here. There's another one. I'll just make a little forest. No, they call it a stand, not a forest. It's called a stand of pine. I'll get the correct terminology here. There we go. Maybe, I like to have a little
tree that's leaning over. Maybe a big old deer stepped
on him when he was little, and put a little hurt on him. Now, we'll just take and drop in some more foliage right there. See how you can just keep
building and building, and building and creating
more and more depth in your painting? While I've got that on the brush, I can put in some general reflections. We take our large brush
and grab those reflections, and pull downward very gently, very, very gently, then come across, that easy. Let's put some trees on the other side. Boy, these trees are so much fun. Maybe there's one right there. Touch the corner of the brush. A one-inch brush will
work very well for this, or the two-and-a-half inch brush. A lot of times, I use the one-inch and the two-and-a-half-inch brush. Today, this painting has got
so much fan brush work in it, I just decided we'll do
'em with the fan brush. You can do entire paintings
just with the fan brush, and they are beautiful. Okay, maybe right there, wherever you want 'em. Every so often, pile your paint back up. You need a pile of paint to work from, so you can load the brush deep. There we go. If you find that your
paint's not sticking well, add a little paint thinner. That'll thin it down and
makes it stick better. We'll just very quickly drop in a happy little thing right here, and maybe there's another. There it is, wherever you want it, wherever you want it, that's where it is Another tree, like so. Let's use the old big brush. Let's get right in here
with some Prussian Blue and some crimson. Let's go and let's drop
in some color right here, and I want a reflection in here, so I just pull the reflection, shoo, shoo, shoo, that's
all there is to it. Come across, and bring this, and bring, there we are. I went right down in there, right down in there. Time to put some
highlights on some of this. On these evergreens up here, I'm just gonna put the least
little touch here and there. This is that same orange-y color. I don't want too much. I want this to be almost a silhouette. Right here, a few little highlights, a few little grassy things
growing up and down there, like that. Now, I'm gonna take a
little bit of Prussian Blue, and white, and a little
tiny bit of crimson, mostly blue and white,
with a little crimson. Let's go right up here and put
a little bit of land in here. There we go. While we've got that on the knife, let's drop a little bit right in there, just like so, wherever you want it, like so. Maybe's there some. (laughs) Just make decisions and drop it in. Got to make the decisions. I'm gonna take some yellow,
and some Permanent Red, and let's do these trees over here, the tiniest little bit. I don't want a great deal of highlight. I'll try to keep my silhouette. There. Let's drop a few little
highlights here and there. Let 'em come down into this land area. Just let 'em come right on down. The one-inch brush would work very well for putting all these
little highlights on. Since I've got the fan brush
going, I'll just use it. It's a super, super little painting. It should give you a lot of ideas, and set your imagination on fire. You can do this in any color combination. I'll get the knife here, and let's take a little
bit of the Magic White with the purple in it, and drop in some little water lines, just like so, barely touching. Some over here, the Magic White with a little
bit of the purple color. While I've got that on the knife, maybe I'll make a few indications of just little tree trunks here and there, where you can, just
looks like little trunks. Don't want a great deal of detail, just little indications here. We don't know how many trees are in there. We don't really care. Okay, I think we just about
have a completed painting there, and it's something that
I think you'll enjoy. Try it at home. I'll take a little thin oil, and I'll sign this one. My signature's not gonna show up very well against all this red, but it's here. I hope you've enjoyed this painting. It's certainly a pleasure
being here with you today, and from all of us here, we'd like to wish each and
every one of you happy painting. God bless, and I'll see you next week. (mellow jazzy music)
