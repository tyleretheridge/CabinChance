(calming music) - Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today we'd just do a fantastic little seascape and show
you a very simple way of doing a seascape that
I think you'll enjoy. Let's start out and have
them run out all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with me. Let's go on up here; let
me show you what I've done. Today, I took a piece of contact paper and cut a little oval in it, and just stuck it onto the 'ole canvas, and I just covered the canvas here. The top part is just
a little Liquid White, and I have a little piece
of masking tape across here. This is gonna be my horizon. And down here is Liquid Clear. And we put the clear
on because, down here, I'm gonna have some dark colors and I don't want to dilute the color. Up here, I want to dilute the color. Okay, so that's basically all we've done. Let's start out today and
just have a good time. Let's try a little bit of Cad Yellow. We'll make a beautiful little sky today. Super day, so it's a nice day to make a pretty, bright, shiny sky. A little yellow, let's
go right up in here. Maybe, right there. Maybe we'll put a little
sun up in the sky; that sounds like fun. Now, without cleaning the brush, then we'll go reach right down here and get a little bit of Yellow Ochre in the same way, making little Xs, little criss-cross strokes. Just lay a little bit of that
ochre right around there. And that ochre's sorta a
gold color; it's very pretty. A very, pretty color. It'll make you happy. There Now then, still, without
cleaning the brush, we'll go right into Bright Red. And let's just go right
around the edges here. Beautiful little color. But, be careful. it's very strong and it'll eat up your whole world in just a heartbeat. There, maybe a little touch more. You could always add more, but it's a son of a gun to take it off. There. Okay. Something about like so. Okay, now then. We'll take a little of that Bright Red, a little touch of Phthalo Blue into it. Be right back. There we are. A little Bright Red, a little Phthalo Blue and go right up in here, and we just, very quickly,
dance in a little sky up here. A little blue. Okay, let me wash the 'ole brush. That's the fun part of
this whole procedure. Just wash it. Shake off the excess, and just cover everybody in the studio. Now, with a nice, clean
brush, we can blend this. I think it was in the
last series, we showed you one of our cameraman with his raincoat on. He sits over there with his raincoat because I've been known to splash him. There. Now, then. I beat the brush just to knock off any paint that I've picked up. It's much easier than going through the whole cleaning procedure again. Okay, now we'll just
blend this all together. And you want to blend this
to where you can't tell where one color stops and
the next color starts. There. And when you're doing this at home, sort of step back and take
a look-see at your painting. It's hard to see it when
you're very close to it. So, step back and look and see if it's exactly what you want. If it's not, blend it a little more, or add some more color, or
whatever it takes to fix it. There. Take a little bit of Titanium White, and maybe we gonna have
a sun right up in here. So, we'll take that white
and we'll just begin dancing; I want a very light area
right around the sun. There, we'll just let that
blend outward, outward, outward. That easy. Okay. See, now we have a nice,
bright spot right up in there and we'll just the old finger-- we'll do a little finger painting. Go right up in here and we
just draw a little circle. And make your sun round. If you make a square or oblong sun, people sort of laugh at 'em. We don't want anybody
laughing at your sun. Clean brush, and very gently, very gently. You can just go right over that and sort of blend it a little. And it gives you a nice little
indication of a little sun way up there in the sky. Okay, maybe we have a couple happy, little clouds in our sky. So, for that, let's make some lavender, we'll take a little Alizarin Crimson, a little touch of the Phthalo Blue, just mix them together. That's very difficult to
see what color that is, so we'll take a little
white, put it over here, check it, see if it's what you want. That's pretty good. Okay, let me grab the brush. Maybe today we'll use old fan brush. I take a little bit of color. Little color, a little bit of
white so it's not real strong. There. Just load some
color into the fan brush. Back and forth. Now then, let's go right up here. You have to make some big decisions. Where does the clouds live in your world? Maybe there's a happy, little cloud that lives right up here
and just floats around. Just floats around and has a good time. There. But just use the corner of the brush and make little tiny circles. Maybe there's one that comes
out right across the sun. Wherever. Maybe, there's one down here. But in your world, you put as many or as few clouds as you want. Because painting is very individual. Everybody sees things differently, and so you should paint
things the way you see 'em. There. Maybe over here there's a nice cloud, just floats right along, and this'll be the horizon right here. So we'll just let this cloud
float right along in here. Okay, maybe there's some
little stringy clouds, and to make those all you gotta do is sorta pull the brush like so. A little more color on it. There, those are the easiest
kinda clouds to make. Maybe up in here-- Shoot, who knows? Maybe there's another little
cloud lives right here. As I say, when you're doing this, decide how many clouds
you want in your world and just drop 'em in. Just drop them in. Maybe up here there's
another little tiny one. He lives way up here in the sky; he watches all this down here. Now then, take a good, clean, dry
brush and, very gently, we're just gonna kinda stir it up. using just the corner of the brush. This'll blend it all together and it also removes any
excess paint that's on there. There. And then very lightly. Very lightly, just blend it. And fluff it a little if you want to. Look there, though, and a super nice, easy way to make some very, very effective little clouds. Now these stringy ones
here, all you have to do is just pull those, just
give them a little pull. And since the canvas is
wet, you can move them. Zoom, there they go. There. And maybe there's a little sunlight playing across some of these. I have several fan brushes going here so I don't have to spend
all my time washing them. We'll take some Titanium White, get a little bit of the Bright Red. Don't want too much. Just enough to sparkle it a little bit. A lot of color on the brush, though, really got to filled up. And then maybe, in our
world, maybe a little light plays right through here, just bounces right across the tops of some of these little clouds. Don't want to overdo. But just here and there,
wherever you think light would just hit and sparkle. A little more color. Maybe there's a little over here, too. Okay, super. Maybe, right here is a little
indication right on top of a little light playing on that cloud. Then a little there. Wherever Now this cloud, maybe, add a
little color right along here. Like so. Just sorta make a decision where you think the light would hit it. Needless to say, it's
gonna hit right under here, right along in here. Now, then, the good,
clean, dry brush again. Be sure it's dry. If it's not, it's gonna
sorta just moosh together. That's a new word. There. Just sorta wind it up. I like to do seascapes, but I like these that have a lot going on in them. Sometimes they're sorta hard
to do in the time we have here. I know recently I did one that was-- Oh, gosh, it just hit so nice. I just couldn't get it
down where I could do it in 30 minutes, so we featured
it in the newsletter. So, everybody'll have
a chance to paint it. There we go. All I'm doing is just blend
that out a little bit. Okay, I like that easy. We've got quite a nice
little sky going there. Now you could use this idea for a sky in any kind of scene that you wanted; it doesn't have to be a seascape. Maybe you want to do a nice
landscape or something, but you needed a sky like that. And, of course, it'll work just as well. No problem. Let's clean off the old fan brush. We just wash these in thinner,
wipe them on a paper towel. Now, then. Let's start down at the bottom. That's where the fun will start. We'll mix up a little more
of that lavender color. Alizarin Crimson, Phthalo
Blue, proportionately much more crimson than blue. Much, much more. And once again, it's very difficult to tell what color that is, so take a little white
paint lay up, check it, see if it's what you're looking for. That's pretty good. Now, then. We have this piece of tape here. This is just to keep our horizon straight. So we'll take that off. You don't have to have it there, but it certainly makes your life easier. Make sure our mat's still down there. And we can use a two inch brush, go right into a little bit of that. And we're gonna come right up here, and just kinda cover
this part of the canvas with a little bit of this lavender color, and you can use any color you want. Just thought today we'd
use a little lavender. And we try to keep that
horizon as straight as we can. There we are. As I say, I enjoy doing these seascapes; they're a lot of fun. And you can really play with color and make some very interesting seascapes. There. Maybe we'll have a little beach down here. So, instead of putting the
lavender all the way down, we'll wash the brush-- I just like to wash this brush. And we'll just beat the devil out of it. Now down here on the bottom, we'll go into a little Dark Sienna. Now we have the clear down here, so that does not distort the color. There we go. Maybe, a little touch of Van Dyke Brown right down at the very bottom. So we have Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, and then the lavender color that we made, and we just sort of blend those together. Alright. See, if we had put Liquid White on here, we would have diluted all these colors, and I don't want to dilute
the color at this point. Now, then. I get to shake the brush again. Alright, let's play with a little Filbert. First thing I would do, is decide where the major wave's gonna be in here. So come right up in here and
you make this big decision, and just sorta take the
brush and sketch it in. I don't want this to be a very big wave. Maybe just a little one that
lives right in there somehow. Sketch out a basic shape. And there's several ways you can do this. If the eye's gonna be right here, you could take a paper towel, and you can remove a little of that color, or you could just paint right over, but it's a little easier if
you just remove a little of it. Let's take a fan brush. And, let's outline where our
major waves are gonna be. Here's one back here. Choon. Like that. That'll be the little curl right there. Now, then. Clean our little brush. Now, all we're interested
in is what's behind here, so very gently, take
this, and I'll exaggerate, we're gonna make a motion like that. And I'm exaggerating it there. But, that'll create the
trough between the waves. That easy. And back here, same thing. See already, you begin
to get the impression of waves there, and you
haven't done hardly a thing. It's a very, nice, easy way of making a little wave
is quite effective. There we go. Nice, clean brush. Now, let's take a little Titanium White, and the least, little tad touch
of the Cad Yellow into it, and we just gonna use
the 'ole Filbert brush. What the heck? Load some color on it. Let's go right up in here. Now, let's do the eye of the wave. That's always the most fun part. That's what everybody
wants to do immediately. So let's do it and get it out of the way. Put a little color in
there and just scrub it in. Just scrub it in. Now you can do this several times to achieve the desired lightness, if you need be. There. Now we'll take a clean-- and be sure it's really dry. If nothing else, wipe your
brush on some paper towels, and then feel it to make
sure it's good and dry. It's important. It's not dry, it's gonna
just all go together. And just put the tip of
the brush right here, and just turn the handle. It sorta just winds it up. And you can't believe-- See there? Good shot, good shot. You can't believe how
smooth it'll make it. There was a time I would never
have believed you could have painted paintings like this
using great, big brushes, but you can. You really can. There. Now, then. Let me wipe off my little Filbert brush, and we can begin working on the foam. For that, we'll take a little white, a little of that lavender
color, what the heck? There we go. That's a nice color. A little of that lavender and white. And let's go up in here and think about where the foam's gonna be. We'll put in right here. And just scrub it in. (imitates waves) Think about that water
crashing and having fun. And this is the shadow
we're putting in now. We'll come back in a minute
and put in all the highlights, but this is just the shadow,
just to give us an idea of where the foam's
going to turn and curl. Now, go back to our fan brush, put Titanium White on it,
and we can begin putting that nice, sparkly area behind. Just let that wave crash right over. (imitates crashing wave) It really helps if you
make these little noises. There we go. We can go back to our little Filbert brush that has some white on it. Now, we can come in here
and put the goodies on. (imitates wave) Just splash those in there. Wipe your brush off when it
picks up some of the color. We'll let it just barely
break the horizon there. Now, back to our large
brush, and we want to just blend that foam together, very gently. You could use the one inch brush for this if you're a little more
comfortable with it. It's sort of an individual choice. I seem to get along better with
this 'ole big brush, though. And if you want to create
the illusion of little things splashing up in there, just take the color you've picked up on the
brush and just touch. See, it'll make all those little splashes, and they're usually there. They're usually in there. Alright. Let's let that wander right on
off into nothing over there. Okay. Now, then. Grab the 'ole fan brush,
and we can start playing with little foam patterns and
stuff that are living in here. Think about how your
water is gonna be shaped. It's gonna come up and curl
over, so think about that. And as it works out, it's
gonna get flatter and flatter. Just put in a few little
basic shapes here. Then we'll take a large
brush and, very gently, just start blending that together. Just very soft. Just gives you an idea
of how the water flows. Now, then. Take a little paint
thinner on the liner brush, and we'll take a little of
that same old white color, and we can begin putting in
all the little fun parts here. Right along the top of this wave. There. Just let your brush sorta
wiggle and jiggle and have fun. Back here, there it is. This begins to make it sparkle, and all these little things are what makes your seascape look so good. Right along in the horizon. There, see? But go, loop, loop. I hope that makes sense. I hope that looks right. Just like little waves, way
back in the distance there. There. And all these little things
are what really give your seascape character and
mood and make it look good. So spend a little time
when you're doing this. Some of these little
things just work back. There we go. Let's go over here, even back behind here, there should be some. And you can put just
all kinds of these in. Once again, we begin thinking about the way the wave is shaped here. Putting all these little doers in here. There. This is where your wave
begins to take on character. This is where you begin
showing the form in it. Now, we'll take a little
bit of that lavender color. Maybe a little bit darker and put a little line underneath the bottom of this so it separates it. There, see now how that stands out? There's that little dark area in there and you sort of blend it in. And back in here, there's
some little doers. The slider brush, though, is fantastic for doing these little things. There. Okay, now. Now, we said there was gonna
be a little beach in here. So let's take a little bit of the white, and I'm gonna pull it out very flat. Take the small knife, cut off a little roll of paint, like so. And decide where you want
your little beach to be here. Push very firmly, very firmly. There we go, a little more paint. You literally just push off
a little layer of paint. Now this needs to be flat
or it won't look right. Take a fan brush, grab this,
and gently pull it back. But don't kill all your areas in here. Just pull it back. You can also grab the least little touch of it here and pull down and make the sand look like there's water on it. Just like you were making a
reflection, and then go across. Creates that illusion of wetness on there. Maybe there's another little doer in here. Wherever. Sometimes there's several
little ripples in there. Just drop them in wherever you want. Take the fan brush, and
once again, pull it back. There, just all kinds of little things. Now we can go back to our liner brush. And you can just add in
all these little details. All kinds of little foamy
things that are going on. There. That's a super easy way of making a very, very effective little seascape. But play with colors and
stuff when you're doing this, and you can use the
Phthalo Green, for example, and make beautiful, beautiful things. This Liquid Clear,
though, allows you to use this color without diluting it. It stays the same color
that you put on there. If you had white under
there, Liquid White, naturally, it would get very diluted. And we'll take a little dark color and put it right at the edge of this. That little dark color will
cause it to stand up a little, like there's a little ridge,
with just a little dark color. See how it looks like it's
just sorta standing up there? And maybe in our world-- shoot, let's have some fun here-- maybe there's a couple little
stones laying out here. We can make those real
easy; we'll just take a little Yellow Ochre, Liquid
White, some Dark Sienna. I wanna mix up a very thin paint. I'm gonna clean off my knife. Add a little paint thinner on
the brush, go right into some Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, like so, maybe even a little black. Let's take a little black on there. Make a dark stone. Go right down here and we'll take one side and go right through that thin color. So I have light on one
side and dark on the other. Now, maybe down in here lives-- look at there, just little stones, and you put as many or as
few as you want in here. And you can make both sides
of the stone at one time. You can pull down a little color, look like it's reflecting
into that wet sand. However many stones you want. It's up to you, up to you. Just drop 'em in wherever you want 'em. Take a little light
color on the liner brush. Put a little water mark around them. Usually when you have a stone there, a little water usually just
floats around in there. There. Everybody always wants a little bird. I'll take a little
black on my liner brush, thin it down with paint thinner, 'til it's almost like ink or water, and we'll do some little M birds. All you gotta do, see? Just draw a little M. Call those M birds. Anybody can do one of those. Tell you what, let's see what this looks like. I'm gonna take and pull
the contact paper off and expose the entire canvas. Now isn't that a fantastic way of doing a super little seascape? And, you could paint this outside edge any color that you want to,
but before you put it on there, and it really makes it
even more interesting, maybe we'll have one more M bird, and this one-- he sorta broke out there. He come out the edges. There. Alright. I think we're there. We got a pretty good little seascape. Let's sign this one. Take a little red, and we'll sign this rascal
right down here in the rocks. Hope you've enjoyed this one. Give you a lot of practice with a very interesting little scene. Once again, I think you'll enjoy it. So from all of us here, I'd
like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (calming music)
