right glad you could join me today today I thought we'd do a nice beautiful little winter scene it's sort of warm and has a beautiful little glue and I think it will make you happy so let's have them start off and run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting and they'll come across in the same order as I have a moment palette now I've already covered the canvas with it then even co2 the liquid white it's wet and slick it's all ready to go let's have some fun start today with a little one-inch brush going to a little bit of cad yellow the tiniest tiniest little amount of the bright red tiny little milk can't say that enough just work a little bit into the bristles go ahead up here i'm gonna have a son in this painting so you'll have the sun right about there and we start off just making a little circle so you got to do like so okay now i'm going to wash the brush now we wash our brushes and odourless thinner just beat the devil out of it okay now then I'm gonna go into titanium white and will come right down here and get a little touch of alizarin crimson just like so okay ask her right up in here and we'll work this in using a little little crisscross strokes a little excess if you use these little crisscross strokes rather than draw on a big circle it's much much easier to blend all of these colors together I'd really recommend to use these little strokes like so maybe I'll add the least little touch of crimson here and make it a little bit brighter so you can see it better on you said anytime some of these colors are so soft it's hard to see we'll bring it right on out like it normally when we're doing these paintings for television be painting a little brighter then we would at home so when you're painting at home you paint in any way that makes you happy bring it right on down like that okay I'm gonna go to a two inch brush it's a little bit faster now go right into the crimson tiniest little bit tiny little bit and now I'm going to add just a small amount of the dark Sienna to the crimson make a very warm Brown case go back up here yeah very lightly right around here still making the little crisscross strokes very soft quiet gentle little sky but very effective very effective this is a tight painting that people put in their living rooms just make it look warm they're good sellers if you're interested in selling things so many people write and tell me that they're selling paintings at the ending they believe they could paint what that really makes me happy when people write and tell me that and it's not the money the money is not important it's what it does to your ego and inside here because if somebody's willing to pay you for something you paint it with your hand then I'll makes you want to go home and paint ten more paintings that's what's important it's not the money going right into Van Dyke Brown sometimes I talk too much I have to hush get excited Van Dyck Brown still making a little crisscross now this is mixing with the liquid white and all of these beautiful little things just happen a little bit more of the brown and right there looks just like an egg I cook this morning bad news I'm not much of a cook I'll take just lay a little tiny bit of this brownish color down in here and without him cleaning the brush the least little touch of a little blue tiny tiny little amount okay it will just lay out a little bit of that just hear it just hearing there and you can add other alizarin crimson I'm just putting some colors down here don't worry about blending them together or mixing them at this point alright let's lay that brush down and I have several these two inch brushes going and I'm going to go right up here and again blending still use the little crisscross strokes and you really want to blend this out just blend it blend it blend it working outward and you don't want to bring the dark color in toward the center blend it out right there and you want to blend this till you can't tell where one color stops and the next one starts very soft very gentle then very lightly just take out the brushstrokes if you happen to get a hair on the canvas like I did there just take the corner of the brush and pop it off it's obvious to you now there now let's have some fun we'll put a Sun up in here and for that I'm gonna use my finger let's go right here take a little white and I'm just gonna rub it right in just make a little circle Sun looks a little better if it's round M square Sun sort of bother you there you go see you just push that right in there make a little circle now if you tried blending that it would smear so take your knife come right up here and watch take your knife and just go hoop take it right off the value or the color remains in the canvas now you can come along here let's see you can blend that and that easy and easy you have a happy little side alright and that completes our sky now we can have some fun and begin painting now you have to make a decision here okay I'm going to use the round brush go into Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna I'm just going to mix them on the brush just tap it see just happen there we go let's go ahead up here maybe there's a happy little tree that lives right here then we'll start at the base of this tree and work upwards so automatically automatically it's going to mix with a liquid white and it's going to be darker at the bottom and it is on the top and you have your shadows without even trying darker darker darker down toward the bottom maybe there's a happy little tree or bush it lives there begin thinking about the lay of the land or the way the ground flows I'm going to have a little hill here so that's what I'm again working on we're not worried a great deal about detail at this point but already interested in is a general lay of the land oh there's another one so you just put these little things just sort of fall out of your brush they live in there sometimes you have to tap them out a little bit but they live in there we go and we'll pull a little bit of that color down just the bottom because that'll end up being our shadows in the snow so you use all these things where you get so dark color on the brush you can use it now then I'm going to take a little bit of a liquid black out here on my pallet take my liner brush add a little paint thinner and then work out brush in there and turn it turn it bring it to a super sharp point look at that very sharp all right now that in here in here but just the indication of a few little trunks little stems whatever you want to call them Leones arms whatever okay now one of the questions I get asked a great deal is do you pull it down or you go up it doesn't matter try it both ways and most people will find it works better one way than it does the other now normally I pull down because it's easier for you to see it that way when I'm painting at home a lot of times I'll pull up I don't think there's any rule you just sort of practice and find which way works for you there we try to show you as many ways as possible and turn you loose on the world okay now then we'll take the round brush and dip it right into a little touch of the liquid white just a little touch I'm going to add the least least little touch of bright red here to tie her knees a little bit tap that brush tap it tap it tap it can't go up here now then let's put some beautiful little highlights up here on these trees just use just the top corner of the brush and we can tap in here see there but think about shapes in here don't just throw this on it random leave some of those nice dark areas in here see the patterns that's what gives you tree shape and form now if you have trouble making it stick add a little bit more the liquid white to it I'll put a little more red in there want to stand out a little here we go there we go beautiful you can see that much better thing okay just go right along here and make some decisions how many trees how many bushes oops there's whatever writer C layer that creates depth this is where the little bunny rabbit hides is behind that bush and then up here all winter long the little tree urchin stays I bet you wonder what a tree your chin is that's what I call a little squirrel I have a big walnut tree in my yard and the little squirrels come and they eat walnuts and we have little little power struggles over who's going to get to all nuts be at a squirrel guess who wins squirrels got a nest full of nuts and I have none right up here there I've got one in Little Rascals it decided he liked my garage better to eat it out during a cold he moved into my garage can you get that little devil out so I put some mothballs in his nest dad stinks there now once again while I have this on my brush I'm going to begin pulling in some basic shapes and I'm not worried at this point about much of anything except the lay of the lamp just pull it in just like so all right now then we can take the old fan brush the old fan brush with a little quiet on it and we can begin working on some nice shapes and stuff here this is where again laying in the snow and you can go into a tiny little bit of the pale blue and add shadows it doesn't matter fact it's desirable if you pick up a little bit of this brown and begin working it in here here we go always always paying attention to the lay of the land and thank where the light would hit snow is very really really smooth it has little bumps colors rocks and stones and all kinds of little happy things that are underneath the snow you may not see them but they they cause bumps into snow okay maybe tell you why let's go right here and push in there there's a happy little little grassy area just runs right down the hill see there just make all kinds of little things happen here all right I like to do these little winter scenes are a lot of fun I've fun and it easy let's make you happy okay tell you what tell you what maybe years ago a old trapper maybe he built him a little little house right there so it takes them some of the Van Dyck Brown cut across and get a little roll of paint on the knife there you see right out of the edge is most importance right out on the edge of the knife let's go up here okay maybe the little house lives does now right there there it is see paint that little back you first I tell you what to put a frightening little food fried on the other side see just sort of in your mind think think what a house looks like and he needs a little side over here too all right man take a little quiet a little brown I was hot very flat get us a little roll of paint and that's let's put a nice little touch of highlight on there barely touching very touching just caress the canvas okay now see we can see that the lights coming from here so this sites going to be a brighter this one over here this one's going to be almost dark almost pure brown don't worry about too much color over that say for that guy Liz and there is freezing because there is no roof of his house let's give him a roof let's give him a roof there we go just that easy man he's got a half a roof let's feel sorry for him getting about a half don't want him to freeze okay little snow on the other side just sort of bring all that together and that easy she got a cabin needed or don't get locked in there and keen get out all Wed her there you got a little door take a little white go around edges they're making rascal stand down we'll take the small knife now we'll put a little window right there just a little blue and white just give the indication of a happy little window like that okay whoa chimney we use a small edge of the small knife or you put a little chimney take a little tiny little touch of the bright red skews mahram there maybe he don't have his fireplace let a little snow laying up here on his chimney there we go that easy until you one take a little bit of liquid black maybe there's what remains of an old fence and it went right off here this is just straight liquid black there it goes and there's a fuel rails left on it right off into the distance and then need to do to dirt with wash the brush now take a little bit of the liquid white help look at their little snow laying up here on his fins and a little up here on top there think and you just make all kinds of little things we take the fan brush and grab just a touch of that flame to death all right now we can fix up the foot of this cabin take and work on your perspective look at there you can just cut it right off wherever you want it ever you wanna take a little white little touch it blew into it I come right on here and there's a big ol bunch of snow laying right along there maybe even create the illusion he's been walking right here this using the little tiny tiny bit of a little blue white and we go back to her paint her colors it's got a little pink in there begin building all this in still paint very close attention to the lay of the land its most most important that you always keep in mind the way you want this I am the flow if you don't they will get away from you run right out of your pay T pretty soon you had land going in every which direction so pay attention to that that's it's important so little details that make you make your paintings better make you happier when you get done with your painting it's nice to step back and look at it and feel good about it you want to feel good about it despite their back you see they get a little larger down here cause perspective wise let's get them closer to you all right all right leave out one side done here fine okay let's get serious let's get serious final round brush here let's put something over here on the other side have some fun back into my dark sienna and like round tap petal brush in there so you really beat that son of a gun this is where you take out all your frustrations is it better than kicking your dog of course fees like mine you're kicking he'll take your leg off there we go right work it up see once again we're starting from the bottom I've been working up for 10 so it's darker to bottom and it is on top maybe that ends right up into there mmm I like these very salt earth tones Browns and stuff you're so striking so effective there we go maybe two but right there very tan tell you what I must do we get just so brush go into so much fun let's go right over on this side and maybe right here I'm just gonna push upward see just push look at all the thousands of little leaves and stuff it makes their and that easy it looks like a dead bush there's one right there - we'll have a couple of these little rascals just drop them in wherever you want them and you take a the old fan brush you go right back in here and we can working some of these out create all kinds of pretty things so you can make make the lay of the land go anywhere you want to go wherever see Mike all kind of little snowdrifts up there sometimes it's just so pretty it hurts okay and let's let's change let's change the flow of the lay on here the lay that I watch right here see take it this way and bring it up in here automatically grab some of that Brown pull it down in there automatically you can change the lay of the land so that you can see there's a separate entity here it goes back father pushes everything back okay yeah then let's take I'll use the old knife here let's just put a quick little indication here of a little tree trunk it Doupe Doupe Doupe it's like that few little Leone's here in there little brown and white a little highlight just a tiny touch of highlight you take just a pointed knife look at there straight through and make all kinds of little doers in there little valves and stones and twigs it's that easy okay yeah then let's find that's right there it is the round brush let's have some fun let's get crazy here and we'll take a little the bright red little yellow ocher little Indian yellow but very small amount don't don't get too wild on this very small amount okay let's go right up here maybe this tree here got a little bit of color on it still fall just drop in some happy little things once again worry about patterns shapes think about Leila's in there and I'm just using the very top corner of the brush just a very very top corner look at that top see all the little things and this creates a little warmth in the painting um sometimes I paint winter scenes that are so cold who gosh you almost have to put on a coat to look at them these are very warm and very soft and they go well in people's homes people like these kind of paintings these are the type paintings I do for special friends and as gifts for Christmas and birthdays and weddings and all kinds of things like that brings up another thing a lot of people ask us what we do with all these paintings that we do on TV most of them are used to go into the books that we do but all the rest of them we donate we donate them to PBS stations all around the country into charity organizations for them to make a happy buck with so if you would like to have one one of the easiest ways to get it is to call your PBS station and say hey you know get one of Bob's paintings for your next auction and we'll be glad to donate one to them and it helps everybody out you get better programming that way in the PBS station he puts a happy book in his pocket and you get a you get a painting so keep that in mind if you want one that's let your station know just drop in a few little blue and white grassy areas here Oh kinds of little things going on in here all kinds of oh thanks man I tell you what let's use a knife maybe that's what remains there he's an old fence right here there's a post put one there tell you what three three looks better ins a little bit of brown and white for some highlight doop doop there we go maybe there's still one old one old post is hanging across there just like that that easy okay let's have some fun let me get an old fan brush here go right into the Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna I think yep look at there Shh big old tree big ol tree I put a big tree up painting one time the lady screamed at me absolutely screamed at me so if you don't want a big tree in your painting don't put one in there and then scream at me this is your world so you do whatever you want your painting okay then I'll take the liner brush little bit of liquid black and we'll just put the indication of a few limbs here in there now sometimes I add a little paint thinner to the liquid black to make it really flow easy just let it go just let it really work right off your brush come right on around there look at there see and have some of these limbs that go up and across the tree you don't have them all just going out to side seeing you can put all kinds of little tiny things in there just by stroking the canvas you see then mmm just get sort of crazy and let them go there man will take the knife and a little bit of white brown let's put a little touch of highlight on this tree there it's barely touch give it a little pull it's like the paint grab this is a thick thick paint so it'll grab hang on there maybe this one comes right down in front I can't see there you can just make all the trees you want in your world okay yeah take the old fan brush and put a little slow down here on
