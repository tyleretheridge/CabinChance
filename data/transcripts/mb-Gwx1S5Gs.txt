(Joy of Painting theme music) (smooth jazz electric guitar) - Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join me today. Think today, we'll just do
a fantastic little painting that'll just make you happy. So, I tell you what. Let's start out and have
'em run all the colors across the screen, that you need to paint along with us here. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got done up here. Have my standard ol' 18 x 24 inch pre-stretched, double-primed
canvas, as we always use. I found some masking
tape here in the studio, so I just sorta put that around like so. Took a can of spray paint
and painted the edges. I thought we'd just do something easy. It's a lot of fun. Something a little different. So let's do it. Let's start out with ol'
two-inch brush today. We'll go right into a little
Phthalo Blue, what the heck. Let's go into a little Phthalo Blue. We don't need much, it's quite strong. Just a little. Just tap the bristles right in there. Let's go up in here. Let's just build us a
happy little sky today. As I say, it's a fantastic day here. I hope it is wherever you're at. So I thought we'd do a painting
that just reflects that. There. Just using little criss-cross strokes. Let's just drop in a quick little sky. I've chosen Phthalo Blue
because it's very similar to the color that we
sprayed the canvas with. And you can do this in any color. It just happens to be what we had here, so that's what we used. There. Okay, and that easy, we've
got a nice little sky. Just blend it till it's nice and soft, and it's continually mixing
with the Liquid White which is on the canvas. That way it gets softer and
softer toward the horizon. That's exactly what
we're looking for today. All right, tell you what. While we have that color on the brush, let's add a little more and
I'm gonna reach over here and get the least little
touch of Phthalo Green. Don't need much, just want enough just to flavor the blue a little. Just a tiny bit, okay? Now then, maybe we'll have
a little water in here. Shoot, if you painted with me before, you know that I'm an absolute
fanatic for water, I love it. There. Okay, little bit more color. We'll come from the other side. Just like so. There. And then very lightly and very gently, we'll just go across the
entire water area here. That sorta blends it together
and makes it nice and soft. Now, most fun part of all
this is washing the brush. Let's do that. Just shake it off. (brush splashing and thwacking) (Bob laughing) You can cover everybody in the room. All right, maybe in our world today ... Maybe we have a little cloud. Maybe we'll use a fan brush today to make a little cloud. Just load both sides
full of Titanium White. Let's go right up in here and decide where our little cloud lives. Maybe we have a little cloud in our world. That just sorta hangs
around right here, like so. There he is. And I'm using just the
corner of the brush, making tight little circles. That's all we're doing. Just very tight little circles. There. Now, I'm gonna get a two-inch brush. Be sure it's dry. And very gently, using
just the corner again. Just blend it, just blend
the base of the cloud out. Then very gently, fluff
it up a little bit. Do like that. That easy, you have a very
effective little cloud. Maybe, tell you what, maybe in our world, maybe there's several layers of clouds floating around up here. So we'll just have
another one, right here. Right there. When you're doing your painting, you put as many or as few
clouds in it as you want. Up to you. (brush banging) Good clean, dry brush. Be sure your brush is dry. If it's got thinner in it,
when you touch a cloud, it's gonna get very thin
and diluted and you're not gonna be able to blend it like this. But you can put as many layers of these in as you want, just one after the other. See there? There we go. (brush banging) I always beat the brush, just
to knock out any excess paint. Because it's continually
picking up a little paint. So, just by beating it, you
don't have to go through that entire cleaning procedure. There. (brush beating) Maybe today in our world,
we have, let's see ... Tell you what, let's have
a nice mountain in here. For that, I want to go in to some black. We'll use a little of the blue. We use a little Prussian
Blue, Alizarin Crimson. Maybe even a little brown, what the heck. (knife tapping palette) Just mix it up, pull it out
as flat as you can get it and cut off a little roll of paint. That lives right out on
the edge of your knife. Maybe our big mountain lives ... Where does it live? Maybe it comes right down here. I don't know, maybe it goes
right on off the canvas. (knife scraping on canvas) That's always sorta interesting. When you hvae one that just sorta lives way up there in the sky. (knife tapping palette) Maybe, back in here. Wherever, wherever. Put another little one right there. Just sorta let him float
around in that direction. Just sorta make a decision and put it wherever you think it should be. That's really all you have to do. There, now then. With a clean, dry, two-inch brush, we wanna grab this and pull it. That does two things, two things. It removes excess paint, so
the next layer sticks easier. And it makes your mountain get lighter and lighter, toward the base. That's exactly what we're looking for. There we go, just blend it till it just sort of floats up there in the sky. There. (brush sweeping across canvas) That easy, we've got our base color for a very nice little mountain. Let's take ... We'll use a little Titanium
White today, what the heck. Take a little white, also pull it out as flat as you can get it and go down, cut across, and get our
little roll of paint. It's very important. Maybe we'll start right here. You can play little games
and have fun with this. No pressure. Absolutely no pressure with a knife. You're just barely, barely touching it. We'll take a little touch of ... Oh, we'll use a little
touch of Phthalo Blue. Maybe a little touch of black in it. Make us a nice shadow color. Something like so. Okay, once again our little roll of paint. We go right up here, and decide where the shadows are. There's one. Here comes one. (soft wooshing sound) Goes distinctly through that one. There. You can put shadows. Just wherever you think
the light would strike. Now, nice clean brush. I wanna just create the illusion of mist. Tap that, very gently. Very gently. Two hairs and some air. Sometimes it's fun when
you're doing mountains to play games with which one's in front and which one's in back. But make up little stories in your mind. Maybe this mountain lives right here and it comes, looky there, see? Distinctly in front. (knife scraping canvas) There we go. Also, sometime's it's very nice to have a little cloud that floats along and goes right in between those. So, I'm going to add
the least little touch of Liquid White to the paint,
right on the fan brush. The Liquid White's to
make it a little thinner. Because a thin paint
will stick right up here without messin' everything up. We can put a happy little cloud, that lives right in
here, between these two. Clean, dry brush. Very gently. Float it a little bit, there. That'll give us the
impression that there's a little cloud up there,
and we can bring this right on distinctly through. Okay. Now then, back to my Titanium White. Let's begin putting some highlights on this mountain over here. No pressure, absolutely no pressure. The most gentle touch. Just float right through here. (soft zooming sound) Absolutely no pressure. Let's go to this big one here. (soft whooshing sound) (knife scraping and tapping) Here it comes, right there. Your paint has to be very firm. Very firm, or you won't get this breaking. And this breaking is what
makes your mountains so pretty. There. Just begin working it. Let it go. Just let it go. On the other side,
we're gonna have shadows coming right down through here. No pressure though, once again. (soft zooming sound) Gotta make those little noises, or it doesn't work right. (knife scraping and tapping) There. Now, you can continue
to work back and forth. Maybe we wanna put some
nice bumps and ridges out here on this mountain. There they come. Just sorta let your
imagination be your guide here. There. Back to our shadow color. Because every time you have a little projection out here, you
need a shadow behind it. It needs its own, distinct shadow. Here and there you can
touch a dark base color a little bit, just let a
little of that flow right down. Just play games with light and dark. That's what'll make your
mountains so fantastic. There, wherever you think
these little things should be. (knife tapping palette) Little bit of our shadow
color here and there. Right in there. Shoot, we're gonna mess around and have us a mountain here. (brush banging) Okay, let's just tap now. We wanna create the illusion of mist down at the base of this big ol' mountain. Tap and then we lift upward. Following the angles in the mountain. All this does is remove the tap marks and blends everything together. Just blends it together. Over here, you'll follow these angles. It's most important though,
that you follow these angles. There. Right in here. Sometimes, it's a lot of
fun just to play some games. Watch here. Maybe in our world, there's another little mountain that lives right there. Put a little dark in and this is a way of creating the illusion of distance. In your painting, when you have layer after layer of these things. Scrape off the excess. We go back to our Titanium White. Put a little highlight
right here on this one too. (zooming sound) Just let him go. No pressure, I can't
say that enough times. I say it over and over because this is one of the major problem areas that I hear in letters and stuff. Hard time making the paint break. The reason normally is,
either one of two things. Too much pressure, or
the paint is too thin. Mix up a little more
shadow color here, ran out. Then we can put us a little
shadow, right in there. See how you can move things around? You have unlimited power on this canvas. Can literally, literally move mountains. Now, once again, let's grab
that, tap a little bit. Create that misty illusion. (brush tapping canvas) Okay, then just blend it, like so. We can take a little
bit of that shadow color on the brush, maybe, shoot ... Maybe there's a little
foothill that lives right here. Just using the corner of the brush. Maybe there's a little foothill. But all these different planes, create the illusion of distance. And, watch here, watch here. Sometimes you can even get
a little crazy and watch ... See how it'll push that foothill back and bring that mountain forward? Isn't that fantastic? And you can do that. (brush tapping vigorously) You can do that. Blend it. Now you have a foothill
behind the mountain. That easy though, you
can change your mind. Push mountains around and move rivers. Whatever you wanna do. Okay. Tell you what, wipe off the old knife. Let's mix up a little bit
of lavender color here. For that, we'll use a little Phthalo Blue and Alizarin Crimson,
proportionately much, much more crimson than blue. We'll make a nice lavender. If you wanna see what
color your lavender is, take a little white, and
mix some color with it. Because you can't tell,
that just looks black. So put a little color there. That's just right. Let me clean off my knife. We'll grab us a fan brush. Tell you what, let's go
right into a little of that. I'll pick up some white, there. Just make sort of a nice lavender color. Maybe even a little more of the crimson. Oh, I like it better. But just mix this till
it's the right flavor. There, and maybe back
here in our world ... Yeah, there's some little evergreens that live back here, some
little trees that are far away. Just little doers. There. Now if you have trouble
making your paint stick, over the top of this other, add the least, least little touch of paint thinner. But it takes very, very little. Very little, don't get carried away. It's easy to overdo. Maybe a few of these trees back here, maybe they're a little bigger. You can make out detail on 'em. There. Give him a little friend. (brush scrubbing canvas) There we are. Now then, I'm gonna take two-inch brush and I want to create the
illusion of mist at the base. Just by tapping with the
top corner, we can do that. Want it to be very soft and hazy. Very misty back there. Just let that sorta go
on off into nothing. But look at all the
different layers in here. (brush scrubbing vigorously) Okay good, life gently upward. And just blend it out, down on the bottom. There. All right, time to have some fun. Let's mix us up some color here. We just take a bunch of dark colors. We'll use black, Prussian
Blue, some brown, some crimson, maybe we'll
take that Phthalo Green that was left and throw it in there too. There we go. Maybe even a little Sap Green. I want it to have a little
greenish tone to it. But you might as well mix up
a pretty good pile of paint. Pretty good pile of paint. Shoot, I'll just use
that same ol' fan brush. That's workin' pretty good there. We'll load it full of color. A lot of paint on both sides. Now, we have to make some
big decisions in our world. Maybe there's a nice evergreen
tree, lives right there. I'm gonna dip the brush into the least little bit of thinner,
so it'll stick easier. 'Cause we're going over
several layers of paint now. So we really need the paint to be a little thinner, so it'll stick. I'm pushing upward with the brush. Just to make a little
evergreen right there. Tell you what, that worked so well, let's have another little evergreen. Just push gently upward with the brush. All you have to do. There. And you make a decision, how
many trees live in your world. Maybe there's one there. I don't know, one there. This is an excellent way to
practice your little trees. Make a few of them, what the heck. We'll put one way over here. Make a few of 'em. There he goes. We'll just, while we got this old fan brush running here, we'll just push in a little bit
of dark color, like so. There. Tell you what, let's
grab the two-inch brush. I want some reflections under that. So all you have to do, since
the canvas is wet with the Liquid White, is grab that
and pull it straight down. Pull it down, isn't that sneaky? Then go across, and we
have instant reflections. Maybe there's a little
projection comes right out here. Something like so. In your world, you make the decisions. Where you want all these
little things to live. Just put them in. All we're doing is laying down a dark base color so we can come back and put a few highlights on there. Okay, now I need a little
reflection under that. Each time you do a
little peninsula of land, you need a little reflection under it. Or, when your painting's done, it'll look just like it's floating. Tell you what, while we
got that ol' brush running, let's go on the other
side and give it a tree, We don't want it left out. Maybe this tree lives up there. Maybe it goes right on off the canvas. We don't know. Push upward though. Think about little individual limbs that live in this big tree. There we are, there. Just drop 'em in. I like to do these evergreen trees. They're so nice. Maybe right on down to about like there. Wherever. We'll give him a little friend too. We'll be painting a whole forest here, in just a matter of a few minutes. There we go. Tell you what, maybe right out here. There we are, let's do somethin' like so. Just let your imagination go. Look at your painting. Everybody's painting is gonna
look a little different. Look at it, you may have
things that are better, that you don't wanna mess up. Don't change it just because I did. Gently across. (brush beating) Now then. Take a little white, little Dark Sienna, mix it together, and let's put
the indication here and there of a little tree trunk
in some of these things. Just touch, won't be much
showin' way back here. Maybe there's one right here. We don't want him left out. And then on our old big tree. That's a big one, see more of it. There, I'm gonna grab another fan brush. I have several of each brush going, so I don't have to spend all
my time just washing brushes. We'll take a little yellow and I'll take a little of that color
we made the tree out of, mix it together, it has blue in it. So automatically, it's gonna
turn a beautiful green. There. Just get it to whatever
flavor you want it. Let's go back in here. Light's coming from the right. Let's begin putting in
little things like this. Just a few little highlights. I'm gonna put a lot of
highlights in these trees. Tell you what, you know I
travel all over the country. I meet a lot of exciting people. As you know, I'm absolutely crazy about little creatures and stuff. Recently, I had the opportunity to meet a fantastic lady, by
the name of Carmen Shaw. She lives in Orlando and we filmed a little bit of footage
with her, and I'd like to share some of that with you. This is Carmen, feeding
one of her little pets. This is a little possum. Isn't this the cutest little devil? He's just very young. Carmen takes care of animals
that have been orphaned. Or they've been injured
and she patches 'em up. She devotes her whole life to taking care of these little creatures. These kind of people
are absolutely wonderful and they're necessary if we're gonna preserve some of these creatures. I want you to watch how she
feeds this little possum. He's a hungry little dude. There. I just get to go and enjoy him. She has to do the taking
care of it though. Looky there, think that
rascal's not hungry? (Bob laughing) He's something else. I got to spend several hours with Carmen. She shared with me quite a few animals that she has over there. She has everything from cranes to hawks and owls, just a multitude of animals that have been injured or hurt. She does all of this on her own. I think that's fantastic. In amongst all of her little creatures she has deer and foxes and raccoons, etc. She has a little fox named Major. Which is one of the cutest
little creatures God's ever made. Major has been hurt, somebody
even cut his tail off. But she allowed me to
go in the cage with him. Show a little bit of that
here in just a second. All we're doing here is just
dropping in some highlights. There, okay. Just pushing upward with
this brush, like so. The little fox, as I
say, his name was Major. He's absolutely precious. He thinks he's a puppy. That son of a gun is just
about as tame as he can be. I got up all my nerve and got
in the cage with him there. As you can see, we made
friends very quickly. And we had a very good time together. While you're watching that, I'm just going to put in a
little water line right here. This little devil was
fascinated with my hair. Of course, I guess he
thought it was steel wool. Maybe it was time to clean the dishes or something, I don't know. But he was fascinated with my hair. He tried to eat my hair off. Only thing I'm doing here
while you're watching that is just putting in a few little
water lines here and there. Just with a little touch
of the Liquid White. But isn't this little fox just beautiful? Just fell in love with him. His name is Major. There. Okay. (Bob laughing) I spent about an hour in
the cage with this rascal and we just had a heck of a time together. While you were watching
that, I just put in a few little water lines using
Liquid White on the knife. Now then, I'm gonna take ... Let's have some fun, shoot. Put out a bunch of Liquid White here. Wipe my hand off there. And with that, I'm gonna put
a little Dark Sienna into it. Hittin' my hand with the paint. We'll take a little bit
of the Van Dyke Brown, Dark Sienna, and I'm
gonna go right through this thin color that I've made. And maybe up here, there's just a few little stones that live in here. All you do is take the
side of this filbert brush and just do like so,
wherever you want these little stones to live,
just go like that, see? You can put as few or as
many in here as you want. There they go. It's sort of neat when you want a little stone here and there. There's one even back here. Now then, let's take here a little bit of the Liquid White on
the knife and just sorta go around these stones, that helps set 'em right down into the water. We can take a fan brush,
little Liquid White on it. Least little touch of Phthalo Blue. Let's just go in here, and
just begin putting in all kinds of little water things
that live around these stones. There. Just let it work right on back, like so. Hope you enjoy seeing
these little animals. They are so precious and
I love to show 'em to you and share 'em with you. 'Cause these little
critters are my friends. I spend a lot of time with 'em and I enjoy meeting people like
Carmen, and the bird lady we bring here in Muncie and everything. These are special people to me. Okay, tell you what,
let's come right up here. Let me pull this tape off, and let's see what we've got today. (tape peeling) This is just plain ol' masking tape that anybody can pick up. And when you take that off, it almost looks like
the picture is matted. It's a very nice little effect. Let's take a little red, liner brush. Let's sign this one. Right about here. I think we'll call it finished. I hope you try this little painting. It's very nice and you'll enjoy it. From all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend.
