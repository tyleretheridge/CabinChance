- Hello, welcome back again. This being the final show, normally we devote it to a
question and answer period, but we've had so many cards and letters requesting that we
paint the little picture that you see on the introduction, that I thought we'd go
ahead and do that today. I think most of the questions
and the problem areas we went over somewhere during the series. If you have some questions
that we haven't answered, drop in-line in care of this station, and I'll be glad to try
to answer them for you. Let's paint the one that you always see at the beginning of the show. I'm gonna start with a
little bit of Phthalo Blue. Tiny bit of Van Dyke Brown Mixed with it. We'll just start right up in here, just making little criss cross patterns. This is a fun little picture, I think you'll really enjoy it. Just let it work downward here. While we have the brush dirty, I'm gonna add a little bit
of Phthalo green to it, just a small, small amount, and we'll throw in some water. Just like so. Now clean the brush. And we'll go back and
blend all this together. Start in the light area and work upward, into the dark areas, and
just smooth this out. This particular painting
that you've been watching has a lot of almighty clouds in it. They're a lot of fun to do. So I'ma go right into the Prussian Blue, Van Dyke Brown little touch of crimson. Blue, brown, crimson. And we'll just lay in an
almighty cloud right in here. Just let it work around
and play and have fun. Now this may not be an exact duplicate of what you see in the
beginning of the show, because it's virtually impossible to create an exact duplicate. I'll try to show you all the steps in it, so you know how it was done, and you can do your own at home. Alright, that gives us
some nice cloud shapes. Clean the brush again. This is a nice one 'cause I
get to clean the brush a lot. With the fan brush, Titanium White. And a tiny tiny little bit
of the Permanent Red in it, just to give it a little warmish glow. Lot of paint in the brush. Now let's just go right above the dark, and lay in some highlights. There we are. While I'm doing that, one
question I will answer. We got a lot of cards from the last show, my son was on that show, the last one, and he read the questions to me. So I'll tell you just
a little bit about him. He's just about 18 years
old, six foot four. He's a black belt in karate. It's bad when you have to
ask permission to spank him. But he couldn't be with us this time, he's getting ready to set up a class. He travels with me and
teaches this fantastic method. So maybe if we come to your town, and demonstrate or teach,
you'll get to meet him. I hope you enjoy him as much as I do. There. Just outline the clouds. Now very quickly, with a large brush, just blend the bottom out, leaving the tops
unaffected, don't touch 'em. There. Just the bottoms. And don't overwork these things. They're very, very easy to overwork. Now very gently we lift it
up, just sort of fluff it. And don't worry if you pull some of these little stringy
things up in the sky, they'll go away. Clean, dry brush, just gently blend it. Very gently. Almost let a hair touch a canvass. There we go. Now we had a ridge of
mountains in that painting. This is probably the most complicated, and hardest mountain to do. And it looks the easiest,
that's what tricks ya. Blue, brown, little touch of crimson. And you just very quickly
throw in the basic shape. Very, very little paint here. Very little paint. And really push it into the canvas. Now with a large brush, I'm just gonna take and pull that down. Just to take off all
that excess, loose paint. And to blend the color out on the canvas. There we are. Now we'll take a little
bit of the Titanium White. Pull it out very flat. Tiny, tiny, tiny little bit of paint. And just begin thinking where you think light will strike there. Almost no paint on the knife. Very, very little. Just where you think
the light will strike. There we are. Maybe a little bit over in here. Now for the shadow, I use a little bit of
blue and brown, and white. There we go, just to make sort of a bluish, grey color. And then we can lay some of that in. Just here and there. Once again, very little paint. There we are. And we just sort of bring
all of this together. Let all these little things
start happening in here. And you're doing this at home, you can put all kinds of
little details in here. They sort of get upset if
I go over 30 minutes here, and yell at me a lot, so. Just wanna give you a brief
idea how this was done. Maybe there's a little something that plays right along in here. Just like so. And you can put these little peaks and stuff wherever you want 'em. There's one. These are very quiet,
soft little mountains. Far, far in the distance. Maybe a little shadow
right in here somewhere. With a clean dry brush, just tap the bottom here, and diffuse it. Don't wanna destroy it, just diffuse it. Just like in all the other
mountains we've done, always follow your angles. And then lift up, we're
still following the angles. Most important that you
follow those angles. Just bring all this together. That gives us a nice little
ridge of mountains back here. Let's come forward, and
I'll use the same colors. That was Prussian Blue, Van Dyke Brown, little bit of Alizarin Crimson, and let's take and put
an almighty mountain right up in here. Just let it go. Push that paint into the
canvas, get strong with it. Really push it in. I want this one to be darker,
'cause it's closer to us. So I use a little bit more paint. And then pull it. Just to get that excess paint off there. Alright. Clean up the brush. Add a little bit more
of the Titanium White. We can lay some little
highlights right along here. Just let it flow with the mountain. Follow the angles in your mountain. There. Let it go. This is a very, very delicate touch. Very delicate touch. Little snow layin' right along there. And for the shadow color, we'll take some Prussian
Blue, Van Dyke Brown, and make us up a shadow color. We want this shadow color
to be lighter in value than the base coat that we put on, so that it stands out. Then we can just lay in
some happy little shadows here and there. Just let 'em roll off your knife. Alright. Now once again, with a clean, dry brush, we'll diffuse the bottom. There we are. Lift upward to create the misty effect. And we're ready to move right along, now. I'll take just a little bit of the... Prussian Blue, Van Dyke
Brown, and Sap Green, in about equal parts,
blue, brown, and green. There we are. That'll be our base color
for our trees and stuff. And let's take the fan
brush loaded full of paint, and we can begin laying in
little indications here. There we go. Just keep the brush moving. Just keep it moving. There. I think I'm gonna make a little
foothill right through here. Just drop these in. In wherever you think they should be, that's where they should be. There's one. It's funny how you can do this, and it looks like just hundreds
of little trees back here. And it's so simple. And if you wanna make it look like they're getting further and further away, overall let 'em get a little bit smaller. And we can begin putting in
some ground area underneath 'em. Just like so. Now, we had a few of 'em
that was a little bit closer. Little more detail in them. That looks like a good one
to bring a little closer, so we'll just give him
some little branches. Just back and forth with the fan brush, making it bend downward. Maybe, maybe, maybe, you can. You can put one right there. There we go. Just bring him right on down forward. And it helps create the illusion
of distance in a painting. With a large brush,
grab the bottom of this, and begin pulling downward. Down. Down, down, down. This is where you make your reflections, and have a general idea of where
your shoreline is gonna be. Come across. We'll take a little bit
of Magic White, now, with a touch of Van Dyke Brown in it. Just mix it up good. And we can begin laying a
little water line in here. Keep these lines basically straight, so your water doesn't
run out of the painting. Nothin's worse than having a wet floor, 'cause the water ran out of your painting. Alright, now. I wanna make a separate little
projection right out here, so all I do is take a little dark, just bring it right on out like that. See how easy that is? Grab a hold of it, pull a little bit down, so we have some reflections for that part. Cross. Back to our Magic White. And we can throw a happy little
water line right in there. Maybe there's a couple little ripples on the water here and there. There we go. Now let's take a little of the Magic, a little yellow, and some Sap Green. Mix a lot on your brush. And we can put a few
little highlights in here. Just touch. Let it follow right down
the angle that you have. Darker, darker, darker, as
it comes around the hill. You want the top to be the brightest, and gets darker as it comes around, so it makes it look round this way. Maybe there's a little back in here. There we go. Now we can begin putting
in some trees and stuff. Let's have a nice tree right here. I think I'll just continue
to use a fan brush today. Since I've already got it dirty. Just lay it in. There we are. These little trees live right
there in your fan brush. You just gotta outsmart 'em, push 'em out. Maybe there's one right there. Back and forth with the fan brush. I use the same corner of the brush, all the way through the tree. Just add more pressure
as we work downward. Don't want this one to get lonely, we'll give him a friend. There we are. And I think we had a large
one on the other side. So let's come right over in here. And we'll do an almighty
tree right along here. There we go. There. Lot of paint on the brush. Just let it work off your brush, flow right on down. My brush is getting too slow, let's get in the almighty brush here. I'll use the large one and
just go through the same color. Let's just pop us in some little
bushes and trees and stuff. Just like so. And while we have paint on the brush, just reverse it and drop
some right into the water. That'll end up being our reflections. Little more paint. And we'll let this one just
wander right on down the canvas. Like so. Clean the brush up. Give it a good wrap. Now let's put some trunks on those trees. I'll use some Burnt Umber,
little touch of white in it. Let's go right up here, and let's put a happy
little trunk here and there. Just touch here and there. Scratch a few little limbs and bushes. Let's have a little Sap Green and yellow mixed on the fan brush. And let's highlight these
trees just a little bit. If you're light's coming from the right, you want the right side of the tree to be a little brighter than the left. Don't kill all that beautiful, dark color. Leave that dark in there. Otherwise it'll be flat. You want dimension and
depth in these paintings. Let's go over to this
ol' big one over here, and give him some nice
little shiny highlights. There we are. Clean up the fan brush. Now, with a clean brush, we'll just pull these reflections down. Drop 'em in the water. Go across. And we'll use a one inch brush,
little bit of the yellow. And Sap Green mixed. Load a lot of paint into the bristles. Push those pretty little
leaves right off the brush. There's another one right there. If you wanna reflect him into the water, that's all you gotta do. Just drop it in. Maybe another nice one right out in here. Like so. Let's go on the other side of the canvas. Let's put a happy little bush right there. There we are. Just a touch more of the thin paint. Just so it sticks a little easier. Put a little bush right in here. Oh, there's a nice one. Just let 'em fall right off your brush. Now with the fan brush, we'll use a little of the
Magic White, little yellow, and a little Sap Green. Maybe we'll even throw
a little ochre in there just to break it up a little. We can put some nice little
grassy areas in here. Just little soft things happening. Maybe, maybe, maybe,
we need a little stone. Some dirt chewin' through. So we're gonna just take
some Van Dyke Brown, and let it break, play through there. And we'll highlight it with
some brown, white, and blue. Very little blue, though,
that blue's strong. Just enough to give us
a little bit of color. Then bring it together. Just bring it all together. Now same thing over here,
let's just bring it together. Just put some little
reflections into the water. Now, with a clean, dry, brush, and the lightest touch imaginable, pull straight down. And very, very gently, go across to make those
nice, mirrored reflections. And we can take a little
bit of the Van Dyke Brown. Put us a bank over here on this side. Little touch of highlight here and there. Just here and there. Now with the fan brush, we can
bring all that back together. It's comin' along quite well. Little bit of Magic White to make us a water line underneath here. Once again, if there's
something that you wanna see, in future series, please drop us a letter, let us know what you want. And we'll certainly
try to come up with it. If it's not within my knowledge to do it, we'll go see if we can
find somebody that can. Just scratch a few little
trunks here and there. Like so. One or two over here and there. With the lighter brush, a
little bit of the brown. Little Bit of oil on
the brush, there we go. LEt's just throw a quick
little happy tree right there. Just an old stem layin' there. Think we had one in the painting that you see in the opening. There we are, something like that. Alright. I think we're about ready
for a signature on this one. Little bit of the thin oil. Permanent Red. Bring the brush to a nice, sharp point, with very thin paint. And let's just go right up in here. And put a happy little signature in here. There. Once again it's very nice
to have a short name. Only takes a second to
sign these paintings. And I think we'll call
it painting finished. I'd like to take a few
minutes of your time, if I may, and tell you how very
much we appreciate you allowing us into your home. We hope you've enjoyed this series. And something that you never see, that I'd like to take a minute. I'd like to thank all the fantastic people here at this TV station,
that have made this possible. You don't see all the people
that are behind the cameras, that work very hard to bring
you quality production show, and they too deserve credit. So right here and publicly now, I would like to tell each
and every one of 'em, from the bottom of my heart, that I thank 'em for
everything they've done for us. And I thank you more than anyone, for enjoying and watching our show. We sincerely hope that we
teach you something here. And once again, let us hear from you, let us know what you wanna see. And on behalf of all of us here... We really hope to see you
again in the very near future, we wish you the absolute
best that life has to offer. Once again, have a super day, God bless, we look forward to seeing you again. Bye bye. (relaxing music)
