- Welcome back. I'm glad to see you today. And today I think we'll do a
beautiful little winter scene that has a lot of warm colors
in it so it's not so cold that it's unpleasant. And I'll have them run all
the colors across the screen that you need to do this
painting starting with the titanium white and going around, and they'll come across your
screen in the same order that I have them on my palette. So while they're doing
that, let's get started and do an almighty painting together. I'm gonna take off today
with a large brush. Start with a little bit of thalo blue and just work it into the bristles. And to that, let's add a
little bit of Van Dyke brown. That'll dull it down a little
so it's not quite so bright. And work it into the bristles
so you have a nice even distribution of color all the
way through the bristles here. Okay let's go up to the canvas and let's start right here at the top, making our little criss-cross
strokes, little Xs. And just let this play
around and have fun. There we go. And very quickly we'll
drop a happy little sky in. There. Now while I have this blue on the brush, this is blue and Van Dyke brown, let's just lay a little
bit right down here. Just very quickly throw it in. And this will end up
being shadows in the snow. So we're not really
concerned about where it goes or what happens right now. Okay, we'll wash the brush and we wash our brushes
with odorless paint-thinner. Take off the excess. Hm, and then beat the devil out of it. Okay. I'm gonna use a fan brush today and I'll take a little
bit of the titanium white on the fan brush and
we load a lot of paint into the bristles,
really work it in there. Okay, let's go up here and
build a happy little cloud in the sky. We use just the corner of the fan brush and make little tiny circles. Little tiny circles, there we go. Just... Just let them fall right
off that fan brush. And keep your brush moving, don't stay in one place and keep working. If you do, you're gonna end
up with a big cotton ball up in the sky and we don't want that. We want beautiful little
fluffy free clouds. Okay, maybe right there. Wherever you want them,
wherever you want them. Drop them in. Okay. Maybe there's one that lives there. You have to make these decisions. Where does all these little clouds live? Where do they play? And in your world, you put
them where you want them. Okay, you need areas that are
thick, areas that are thin, areas that have no paint at all. Okay, let's take the large
brush and we're gonna go up here and just very very gently
blend the bottom of the cloud. Don't wanna touch the top at all yet. Just the bottoms. There we go. Okay, let's blend this one over here. And probably one of the
biggest mistakes made when people do clouds
is they overwork them. Don't overwork them. Okay, now we'll fluff them. And grab them, fluff it up. And you're gonna put all
kinds of little things up in the sky when you do this,
don't worry about them. Don't worry. 'Cause when we blend all
this, they'll go away. Okay? Now, very lightly, very lightly. Very lightly I'm just gonna go across. This is three hairs and some air. Just let it sort of graze it. And that easy. We have a beautiful little
sky with some clouds floating around in it, we're ready to go. All right. Now today, I want to put some little trees that are way way back in the distance. So I'm gonna take some thalo blue and alizarin crimson. Thalo blue and alizarin
crimson, now the blue's, many many times stronger than the crimson and to that I'm gonna add
a small amount of white. We're making a purplish
color, a lavender color. There. Okay, now I'm gonna take,
and put some paint-thinner in that and make it quite thin. Quite thin. Let's go up to the canvas now. And up here and we'll just
put in some basic little shapes way back here. We're not looking for detail,
these are background trees that are gonna end up way far far away. This is a very quiet little painting. Very soft. Okay, a little more paint-thinner. Just here and there. Just let these sort of fall
in wherever you want them. This is your world. Drop them in. And maybe here and there you
can see just a little bit more detail. We don't want a great deal of detail yet. Still too far away. Just here and there. This paint's quite thin. Quite thin. Need this thin paint to stick
on top of the thicker paint on the back. There. And that'll give us a
basic idea of some little background trees, and with a large brush
I'm gonna, I wanna create the illusion of mist in
here, so I'm gonna take the large brush and
tap the bottom of this. Just really raise Cain. This is where you take
out all your hostilities. There. I wanna soften the bottom of
this 'till it's just like mist. And here and there, I'm
gonna let a few of them come right up above the tops so it looks like little
soft trees far far away. There we go, just really raise Cain. And then gently, gently lift upward. And it'll create the
illusion of mist back here. There we go. And anything that we get down
in here, we'll use for shadows in the snow so don't worry about it. Okay, maybe we'll put
another layer or two here and I'm gonna add to that same color, a little bit of Van Dyke
brown, a little burnt umber. And we'll just begin
working a little bit closer here and there. A little brown, a little umber. And we can put a little
bit more depth in this. Each one of these planes
creates more depth in your painting. That's what makes it look good. I'm still keeping this paint quite thin. Just tapping the canvas. There, see how easy that is? Just tap it. And it'll make the impression of all kinds of little things happening. A little bit more of the paint-thinner. A little more umber. Maybe there's a few things in here that are a little bit more distinct. Don't want too much yet. We'll lose that feeling of
distance if we get too much detail way back here in the background. And once again with the
large brush, I wanna create mist at the bottom of this layer. And the more planes or the
more layers that you put in a painting, the deeper it looks. So we're just creating depth
in the background right now. There we go, and once again, very lightly, this is just barely caressing the canvas. Lift up. Lift up, there. And you can make as many
layer of this as you want. And each layer will make it deeper, look farther away and create
more depth in your painting. Okay? So, now let's go and begin building some beautiful little bushes that are protuding up through the snow here, and I'm gonna go right into a little bit of the burnt
umber, a little white, and I'm just mixing these
colors on the brush. Just tap them. Just tap them. Okay, let's go right up in
here and maybe we'll begin putting in just some little
things happening way back here and I'm just using the corner of the brush and just barely touching the canvas. This is a very warm brown. It's almost like a burnt Sienna color. Very warm brown. Very soft. And I've added a little
bit of white there, just to soften it down. Now I'm gonna go into a
small amount of yellow ochre on the brush and just
begin tapping the top. Just very soft, very quiet. These are some of the warm
colors I was telling you. So it keeps this winter
scene from looking so cold and a lot of times in the winter, snow covers the ground and you
still have bushes and stuff that create all these
beautiful brown tones. There we go. Very soft, quiet. Okay, maybe maybe maybe... We'll take our liner brush and I'll go right into a little
bit of the Van Dyke brown just like so and turn that brush. That brings it to a nice sharp point. Okay, now let's go up to the canvas. And maybe we can see a few
little tree trunks back in here. And all we do is touch the canvas, 'cause this paint's very thin. It'll slide right off your brush. There. Thin paint will
stick to a thick paint. And we'll put a few little
indications of some trees back in here, don't want
too much detail yet. Just a few little tree indications. There we go. Here and there. Here and there. Maybe there's one that lives over here. Wherever. Wherever. You have to make these almighty decisions and drop these things in. Let them have it. Just let them flow right out of your mind. Okay. Then we'll take another
fan brush and begin deciding where I'm gonna
have some snow in here. And I'm using several fan
brushes so I don't have to go back and forth and wash them so often. Load a lot of the titanium
white and I'm gonna put the smallest, smallest amount of permanent red in there. Or alizarin crimson. Alizarin crimson, I'm sorry. A little bit of alizarin crimson. Just to give it a little
pinkish hue to break it up. And let's go right up to the canvas. Now, angles, strokes, are very very important. Very important. Follow the lay of the land. There, just barely barely
touching the canvas. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. And you do these paintings in stages. Completing the area that's furthest away and working forward. Just work forward. I'm adding a tiny bit of
blue in there to create some shadows. There we go. See how soft and pretty that is? And it's easy. Very very easy. Let the canvas work. Now back to my burnt umber. And I can let some of these little bushes and stuff
run right down on the snow. That easy. Just let them go. It's your world. Let it happen. I'll add a small amount of cadmium yellow and just put it right on the top. Right on the top where
the light's striking. Don't want too much. Just a little. We'll just let this one
maybe come right on out. And anytime you add one of
these little hills here, go back with your fan brush
and clean up the edges. See? You can just clean it right up. And if a little of that
brown comes into your snow, that's fine, it really helps. It really gives it depth. Okay now, maybe in here
there's a little hill. Comes right from here. Now you want that a little
bit whiter, a little bit more of the white color
up here so it stands out from that one back there. Okay and we can lay some
snow right in there. See all these little colors. And the shadows that we laid in there are beginning to show through. 'Cause you're using very little paint, and just stroking the canvas. Okay? We just let all these
little things happen. Now maybe, maybe maybe... Maybe there's another little group of bushes that live right here. You have to make these
decisions and drop them in. Wherever you want. Just drop them in. Maybe it comes right down there. And we go back into a little
bit of the yellow ochre. Yellow ochre. This beautiful, beautiful warm color. And once again, all I'm
doing is just barely tapping. I want the color to be on
the top of each little hill. Just barely tapping. Sort of a different way to
use the brush than we've used it before. But it's a lot of fun. And any way you can use
a piece of equipment to get a desired effect, that's really all that counts. Any way you can use it. Now we can clean up these little edges and create the lay of the land. See, I'm pulling a
little bit of that brown down into the snow. It helps carry through the shadows. All right. There. And you can just make as many
layers as you want in here or you can take them out. Just let your imagination go. Let it go. Okay. Don't wanna lose this
little white line here. If you lose that we're
gonna lose our separation. We don't wanna lose that. Maybe here and there some
of these run up and... Again. Okay. Now, let's play with some trees. Trees are always fun. Always fun. And I'm gonna make a very very dark color for some trees in the background back here and we'll make that by using thalo green and alizarin crimson in about equal parts, maybe a little bit more crimson, than the thalo green. And when you mix these
two colors together, it makes a beautiful, beautiful black. Very dark. Very very dark. Strong color but very transparent because both thalo green
and alizarin crimson are transparent. Okay? Now I'm gonna clean my knife. And let's take another fan brush and we'll pull that through
there and get a lot of color on the brush. There, see. You can see. Just really pull it through. Wiggle it, wiggle it. That helps. Loads the paint into the
bristles and shorten it. Okay, let's go to the canvas and maybe there lives right here, there it is. That old tree, he lives right there. Right there. I knew he was there. There. You knew he was
there too, didn't you? Okay and he comes right down here. That's where his foot's at. And maybe this old tree's got a friend. You know I say it all the
time, trees get lonely too. They need friends. We all need a friend. And maybe there's some leaves on this. Then we just sort of
work back and forth here with the fan brush and just give the impression of some beautiful little leaves. There. See how easy those are to drop on? Just need indications. Now we'll give this one here. There. There we go. And this is once again, thalo green and alizarin crimson. Beautiful, beautiful color. And see, just that easy,
it gives us the impression that there's some beautiful
little limbs out there. Maybe right here lives
another little tree. He's not as big, we'll
make him farther back. And we'll put a few, he
needs a few little leaves on him too. There we go. Needs a little foot to stand on. Don't want him to fall
over and hurt himself. There we go. Okay now we need to,
down here on the bottom, we need to clean that up a little. To bring it all together. So I just take the large brush and just gently tap. Bring it all together. And then with our fan brush, pull a little bit of snow in there. And that easy, we got it fixed. Now while I've got this
black color on my brush here, maybe, maybe maybe, maybe there's a big tree that
lives right here on the edge and all we can see is a few
of his limbs hanging over. There he comes. And when you're doing this,
leave some holes in your tree so some sky shows through. It makes it look deeper.
Don't cover the entire canvas. There. Makes it look like as a tree, the trunk's really off the
canvas and we don't see it. All we see is some
limbs hanging over here. Okay, now take a little
bit of yellow ochre and just barely tap here and there. Same brush. Same brush, didn't clean it. Nothing. Just want a little tiny,
tiny bit of yellow ochre. Just to give it a little
character, not much. Tiniest little bit. There. And that's really enough. And I'm going back to the
liner brush with paint-thinner and a little brown on it, and maybe there lives right here, another little tree. There he goes. Wherever, wherever. And you can put as many of
these in your world as you want. Let them happen. Let them happen. All we're doing here is giving you ideas. What you do with them, everybody sees nature differently. Let it happen. Okay, let's have some fun. Let's have some fun. I'm gonna go right into
some Van Dyke brown. Get a lot of paint on my brush, and just Van Dyke brown. Let's go right up here. Maybe there's a tree
that's a little bit closer and we can see a little more. Now, a lot of times on the
edge of evergreen trees, there's all kinds of little
things that hang out the side. Little berry things,
whatever you call them. But they're not smooth, they're rough. Evergreens a lot of times are rough. So by just tapping with
the fan brush we can create that illusion and then on
the other side of the tree, we'll take a little white and a little brown, and we'll come right down and make the other side of the tree. See, you need a little light here. This tree is a little
closer, it's gonna have a little more detail. Show you how to make those. See there? Isn't that super? Told you it was easy. There, just let it come right on down. And, and and, maybe there's a little of
that color in the snow. We'll create a little
shadow image back here. Just a little bit of shadow. Then with a nice clean fan brush, we'll begin very lightly, very lightly, just blend that right in. There. And makes it look like a
little shadow back here. Maybe there's a tiny bit of snow, goes up the side of the tree, comes down. There we go. Just let these little things happen. All right. Now. Let's put a few little limbs on that tree. And maybe they just hang out like so. Wherever. Let them go, here and there. And you can do this with a liner brush. Comes to a much sharper
point if you want to. Now, you know that old tree is so much fun, tell you what, let's go right over in here and we'll make a great big almighty tree. A big strong tree, give you
some practice doing that. And he lives right there. Just make a decision, drop him in. Wherever you want him. Let him go. Using Van Dyke brown. I want this edge to be
all rough and fuzzy. There. Just put a lot of dark in there. Just really drop it in. Really sockin' that canvas. Okay, then I'll take the brush that has my white and brown on it, and we'll come right down here and do a light side for the tree. The tree needs a light
side to make it look round. Need a dark and a light side. There we go. And just sort of let that
play around wherever you think light would hit. Great big old tree. This big tree's been
here for 100 years or so. He has seen a lot happen. Wise old tree. And then maybe we'll bring
a little bit of snow, comes right up here. And blend that in. See? Just set him right
down into the painting. That easy. Bring some snow right up
around his little foots. Big foots. That's big foots. Big foots. There. Isn't that easy? That easy, you set him right
down into the painting. Okay, now then. Let's take a little bit more of the brown and maybe there's a big limb that hangs right off the canvas
and maybe it comes down and maybe it just bends. Oh, there it goes, comes
right back across the tree. Big, big limb. This is a large tree,
he needs a large limb. A little arm on the limb, wherever. And it helps give the
tree a little personality. There's always dead limbs
hanging on the bottom of evergreen trees. Don't avoid them, they're
what give the tree character. Don't avoid them. Let them little son of a guns come out and sparkle in the sunshine. Okay now, as I say, we
could take the liner brush if we wanted to and add
a little more detail to some of these and all you
do is bring the paint down and you can bring out all
kinds of little limbs. And you can just let
these go and go and go wherever you want them. Okay, I'm gonna take a small amount of, this is almost straight burnt umber, and we'll put a little
weed here and there. And I'm just using the
corner of the fan brush. Touch, lift up. Touch, lift up. Just to put some little
leafy, little leaves, little sticks and twigs and stuff here. Just to break up some
of this white snow area. Just here and there. Maybe, I tell you what,
maybe, maybe maybe... Maybe there's a little
stone, lives right out here. There, see there? You put the little stone in. Let me wash the fan brush here real quick. I'm gonna take a little
bit of the titanium white. Now you gotta pull it over
the stone, 'cause there's snow on top of the
stone, so you just touch, come right over the stone. Look, see there? See, it's easy. And it's fun. Just like so, that's all there is to it. Okay. I think we're about to the point where we have a painting that we can sign. So I take a little bit of paint-thinner and I'm gonna work it, I've
got a little permanent red on the palette here, I always
sign with permanent red. Turn that brush. Turn it so it comes to
a beautiful sharp point. Look there. Okay, let's go up here
and sign this rascal. And this is the part that's fun, 'cause then you have a completed painting. Makes you feel all good inside. And I hope you've enjoyed this one. It's a very soft painting. Think it'll bring you many
hours of relaxation and fun. And from all of us here, we'd like to wish you
happy painting, God bless. See you next week. (relaxed music)
