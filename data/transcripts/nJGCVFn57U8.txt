welcome back I'm certainly glad you could join us today today is the last show of the 31st series so let's start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us while they're doing that let me show you what I hope get done date today I've taken my standard old canvas and I use an 18 but 24 inch but you use whatever size is convenient and I've taken a little black and gray gesso in a foam brush just a disposable foam brush and I've just sort of painted in a little scene here to make these little effects I just took a natural sponge and just dabbed a little bit that's all there is to it let that dry completely and then we've covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of liquid clear so it's all wet and ready to go and I'll show you a nice way of making up just a gorgeous little painting that's very simple let's start out today we want to start with a small amount of the Indian yellow don't need much just a little on the 2 inch brush and in yellow is very transparent so we can just paint right over everything it doesn't matter doesn't matter just let it go like something there like that that's off maybe a little touch of yellow ochre right above it just to change the flavor a little bit and then I'll go into a little bit of the bright red now you decide what colors you want to use how strong you want them to be or how weak it's up to you up to you something about like that maybe my touch of alizarin crimson like there but just let it go and we're just making little little crisscross drops very easy okay once again all these colors were using our transparent enough that you can still see the gesso right through no big deal you're not gonna hurt a thing just paint right over anything it's anyway saying already we have a pretty nice looking little sky okay I want to mix up we'll take some phthalo blue crimson halo blue and crimp so I'll make a little lavender e color but I want this to be to the crimson site so I put many times more crimson in it in blue there have the blue is move much much stronger than crimson thinking yeah let's take a little bit of that color shoot him had to wash the brush yet then and we'll go right up in here and let's just fill in the rest of the sky something about like that this is just a lavender color very pretty we're painting right over liquid clear there we are be sure your brush is dry and free of paint thinner when you're doing this liquid clear and paint thinner have a violent reaction so you don't want to put them together you're sure your brush is as dry as you can possibly get it okay I may be just a touch more of that I like it there okay that is a beautiful color I like lavender I really like lavender purple whatever you want to call it blue and crimson that's what it is time to wash the old brush and that's the part that's most fine okay scrub the old brush and odourless paint thinner and we'll take and shake off the excess and beat the devil at it okay let's have some fun let's take a little bit of titanium white I'm just gonna tap a little right onto one corner of the brush that's all there is to it just tap a little let's go up in here and we'll start right at the edge of this mountain with that titanium point and begin working out and that titanium white is very opaque it's very opaque but when you have it this thin it's thin enough to still let a little bit of that show through there same we can pull it like there's a sunrays coming through there we are just like it just gives it impression if there's a beautiful glow going on back here okay wash the old brush off get it good and dry hey then let's have some fun down here that's about all I'm gonna do for the sky I want this to to look like it's just made and light and it'll give that impression that easy okay dad it down in here you got to decide what we're gonna do oh we got some that lavender color it's sort of pretty let's just cover some of this it's just covered put a little bit of that down there so we have a base color and we'll stop it right along in there we don't want that to get up into the sky just put that on there this so when we when we put highlights along this that it'll pick up some of that color I need to mix up a little more I didn't make enough phthalo blue and alizarin crimson then that's obvious to it just just mix it up didn't have to be well mixed that's good enough good enough now there's a couple of big old trees here we can go ahead and sort of block those in see the basic shapes already there it takes very little color just enough to to create some little arms Oni and that's all you need hey we wouldn't leave him out he get upset there we go something about like it alright now we got all of that blocked in all that was covered with a little bit of lavender and we're ready to go start making big decisions okay I'm gonna grab another two-inch brush I have several of them going here let's take SAP green a little of the yellow little yellow ocher all those yellows mixed together with a little SAP green there we'll just make all kinds of beautiful colors mix them on the brush though tap I push give it a little push okay let's go up in here now back in back in here we want to start yeah now you could do this with a one-inch brush if you would like can do easy there see I just want to start putting the impression of all kinds of little deuter's that are happening around in there just change the flavor a little bit every now and then your darks already there so you don't have to worry about it you don't have to worry about there's a little tree Liz back in there these are far away just the soft trees that live back in there little red every now and then there st. gives it sort of a sort of an autumn feel alright maybe over here there's another one boy there's one that's really red it's bright red that's okay Sookie in our world we can have any color we want cuz we're the boss we can do it all all right now then start figuring out what's happening down here just take and touch and begin tapping just begin tapping it's picking up that color that we put on the canvas underneath there and the more you tap it the more it'll it'll pick it up in the color will just get darker and darker automatically so you have to make the big decision how dark you want it to be I'm just varying some of the colors when I go away putting on a little bit of the yellows in the greens but think about the lay of the land the way the land flows I want the land to look like it's coming like that so that's what we'll do if you have trouble making it stick add a little bit of paint thinner before you go through the paint to load you brush let me repeat one word in there though little bit takes very very little don't put much in there a little goes a long long way a long long way okay Wow look at there look at there and then neat you can do this you really am truly can do it a little practice off you go shoot now like I already have a lot of depth a lot of dip I know what I'm gonna let me show you let me show you I'm sorry I get excited sometimes I want to pull this tree down now you saying Bobby really cracked up now but watch I know it's hard to see you against all that dark but I've decided that tree should be in the foreground we had him in the background and we moved him because in our world we can move trees we can bend rivers anything that we want to do there all kinds of little deuter's i didn't paint over here very well so we'll just put a tree there sort of fill that hole up trees are wonderful for that there we go Hey looks like a little meadow back here now okay just let your imagination take you to any land that you want to live in any place that you want to go alright shoot it's looking pretty good there let's take a little script liner brush take a little brown little brown let me put a little white over there too yeah we got a little brown with a little white I'm gonna make up a very thin thin paint here very thin okay maybe I'll leave a little black to two gray it oh that's perfect Kings grew up in here now in our world there's an old tree trunk in there now if your hands a little nervous you got a little shake this is a time to use it that way you don't end up with just a plain old trunk in your tree but something there is catch some some interest to it and then we're gonna cover most of it up with leaves but some of it will show some of it will show this old tree says I want one too there so you decide you decide where they are they're maybe your maybe your tree don't even have any trunk in it maybe you can't see it we know it has it but maybe you can't see it that's up to you too any way that you want it to be it's just right there maybe we'll give him one more little arm wine over here to hold up at all that old area all right now then let's begin to figure out where these old trees are take a little the yellow little SAP green everyone smiling won't touch it a little bit of red okay let's go up in here let's do this one yeah start right up in here and just begin putting the impression of some little leaves on there that live right out in there all right out there a little more paint on the brush there we are don't be afraid to to stop and load the brush frequently just like we do here sometimes you have to load it several times during one tree that's okay that's okay we're not in any hurry well I'm in a hurry as you know I got a Meno director back here there we are I should talk about my Meno director a little bit she's really a very nice person and I pick on her because she deserves it hmm this whole crew here where we filmed the show some of the best people I've ever met and I'd like to thank them I don't do that often enough because without him there would be no joy of painting they are the best there we are see got a little happy tree right there right there let's go over here home change the flavor a little a little red in there spruce it up some let's go right up in here so put something on this little tree you don't want to be left out I guess this is a big old tree but use just the corner the just the corner of the brush that's all you need don't hit it full on face on it just just the corner and if you have a lot of paint and it's thinner than what's up there it'll come right off your brush and it'll work so well I think the greatest thing about this style of painting it has allowed every person every person who's ever won to put a dream on canvas to do just that you don't have to be blessed by Michelangelo don't have to go to school half your life you can't paint and you could do a real nice job of it there and I got another little tree done now all we got to do is start picking out the little things here and there well add the least little touch of paint thinner least little touch you my team or tap it on a paper towel make sure you got all the excess out you can always go back and add a little more okay a little more of the color and off we go now we'll start picking out individuals here individuals there we are there's a happy little Bush he lives right there what a view he has mm-hmm that's where I want to live right there that's the spot I think he has the best view in here yeah I lived in Alaska for over 12 years and some of the most beautiful scenery in the world is there absolutely as I mentioned earlier this is the last show the 31st series so it's always sort of a sad town when it comes to the last show but hopefully we'll have the opportunity to produce more and if you hadn't got the chance to see all of them cuz there's over 400 shows now do give you station a call let them know that you want to see them because they're available to it they are available to them there we are I'm just putting layers and layers and layers of bushes and this is where all the mosquitoes live I can't they're this good place for my little squirrel to live right here a little pea pod I got one more piece of film I want to show you he's just such a cute little devil hmm it needs something else this is pea pod the pocket squirrel yeah I really like these little creatures they bring a lot of joy to my life a lot of joy where I live a lot of that a lot of the young people come over just to see the animals see what kind of creatures Bob's got that day and it's such a nice way you can't you can't handle a little squirrel like that and grow up and not like them I don't believe you can and I think we need to learn to respect nature and all the gods little creatures and one of the ways that I like to do it is to bring you little characters like him yeah because it'd make you well that's a close-up and a half there sometimes I have eight or ten of them at one time that I'm raising in an alternate loosened okay we have a few little wild birds and all kind of things like yet whatever needs to be raised and taken care of we'll do it it's my way of saying thank you because a little squirrel or whatever you happen to have he allows you to share a little bit of his world for a few days and that's very special not many people get to do that let's go up here in this little bush I've got all these done where you looking at the squirrel yeah that old tree right here we decided he's a hanging around having a good time there he goes it's hard to believe you can take a two-inch brush and do all this in it and take a little phthalo blue and put in there to make a very bright green one hurts your eyes don't want a lot of it a little bit here and there makes it a nice green if you're due in springtime very nice green but a little more paint thinner more brush just to get the paint a little thinner but it needs to be just a small amount don't don't don't overdo don't worry I know I get excited but I wanted to work for you it's most important to me that this works for you I don't even I saw this it's just a natural place for path Van Dyck Brown nard Sienna yeah a little roll of paint on the knife and let's go up in here and let's just let's put us in some brown paint and let's make a path we need a play way to walk back it looks like a little metal that lives back in there and we need a way to get back in there I like to I like to run through the map take my shoes off just just let your foot to run naked through there that's that feels good on the bottom of your feet have you ever done that most people have it one time or another we're they'll admitted publicly or not they're just taking their shoes off and ran through the meadow and I like it okay let's take some white Van Dyck Brown little dark see and I mix them together mmm put a little touch to bright red in there too yeah maybe a little more I like that don't like you know experiment just do crazy things what's the worst thing can happen on this canvas nothing a little roll of paint and it the role of paint barely barely touching just let it grace just let it graze just like you're laying snow on the mountain but in this neat using the the black and the gray gesso sure makes painting easier when you introduce black gesso and grade yes so quite a while back and it has almost become a standard in the art world almost a standard I think I think everybody's using it now there let's take a little bit more of that of this green cover notice it's very thin it's very thin Matt I want to set that down into the painting so we'll begin to put bushes that come up over it distinctly up over the path and that'll push that little rascal right down in there there we go wherever wherever a little bright red and we'll just drop in some little Doozers there something like so you know I've mentioned before in this series that if you have time take a picture of what you're doing send to us we would love to see what what you're doing what kind of success you're having a little letter from you telling us how you're enjoying the show what you would like to see if you would like to see something that I can't paint shoot we'll find somebody that can if you want flowers I'll bring my partner Annette back maybe you seen one her flowers she did once before why rascal can paint some flowers or if you want to see something else just let me know we really we really tried to find shows that you were like try to produce shows you like the little stick right there something about like so just a little neuter it lives in there shoot we got a minute left here hey let's get crazy you know me let's have us yes but lives I don't want to kill that little bush I like him a little tree big tree I mean the other marasco's growing you and we'll have a little tree here he needs a little friend give me my little friend there we are let's make let's make this a birch tree it would really stand out white paint would really stand out against that color there we are easy to make easy to make a little bit on junior here everybody needs a friend even the old tree okay now take our liner brush paint thinner I want to thin it down in some Brown down very very thin very thin a lot of paint thinner let's put a little arm or two maybe this little tree don't have any leaves maybe he's already retired for that for the year we just put him a few little arms up here there we go now maybe in yours you'd like to have leaves on a trick you can do that there are no rules here say what you can or can't paint you paint whatever you want there we are there we are put another one right in there and something for all we called him junior so he needs some he needs a little harmonii felt like it there we are okay and maybe maybe one more little you're there all kinds of little things yeah it's take a little bit of paint thinner but a light color and we'll put a few little sticks and twigs and did live here and there we don't know where they are where they are put them mostly in the dark areas oh there shoot I think with that we about have a finished painting they call sign this one the old clock on the wall tells me it's better time to bring this show and the series to a close I really enjoyed being with you for the past 13 shows and I
