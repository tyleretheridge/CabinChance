hi I'm certainly glad you could join me today because today let's do a fantastic painting let's do the little painting that you see at the little animated opening beginning of each show so I tell you what let's start out and run all the colors across the screen and let me show you what I've done up here I've taken my standard old pre-stretched 18 by 24 inch canvas or whatever size you want doesn't matter and I've taken and painted the basic seen on here with black gesso and I've just very rough just sort of late in the night idea here and there and on top of that on the black part here I've covered all that with a thin coat of liquid clear and then on top of the liquid clear I've covered all of this black area with a lavender color made from alizarin crimson and a little touch of phthalo blue the top we just got a little liquid white on so let's get started have a good time it's a beautiful little painting and we'll just see what we can do it would take a little little touch of the phthalo blue and let's just drop in a very quick little sky up here using a little crisscross strokes and just go right across like so like so and these little shapes that we've painted in here don't worry about them just paint right over we're right over they little blue is so transparent that it'll just it allow those to show right through don't even worry about them there now then I've got several brushes going I'm going to take another brush and put the corner of it and two titanium white titanium white don't go away be right back at least little touch of CAD yellow okay now the corner of the brush that has the yellow I'm going to tip to the bottom down here right here and just blend that upward now that'll turn a slight a very slight greenish hue it'll look like a little bright spot right there doesn't do much right now but later on this painting you'll love what it does now then now I'm going back to the brush that I use to put the lavender color on take a little bit of that same lavender color and just cover up my dark shapes here that's all we're doing allow some that lavender just just to flow right into the sky here it makes a very soft misty effect far far away that's what I like so much about these paintings over here on the other side just a little bit there this black gesso is fantastic because it'll paint a large portion of the painting for you there it allows you to go ahead and fill in all those big dark areas in advance okay now that we can come back here and have some fun maybe today we'll have us a little mountain tell you what I'll just use the same basic lavender color maybe add a little touch of crimson to it a little bit more to the reddish side same lavender color we pay the whole canvas with okay cut off our little roll of paint let's go right up here you have to make your first major decision where does your mountain live right up there thanks oh and maybe it's got some bumps and all kind of little things they go right over it doesn't matter where you wherever you scrape off all the excess paint just you can hear how hard I'm scraping probably just really get in there and raise Cain with it with a large brush we want to grab this and let it blend downward just let it blend right on down I don't want to kill all this area here it's most important to me I want to say that because later on that's going to look like a beautifully little area that's lit right in there it'll make sense in math there we go and then let's take let's take her knife here I'm going to take titanium white least little touch of bright red in it least little touch maybe a little touch of that lavender in there too just a dull it down some yeah still too bright a little more lavender there we go there okay that'll be our highlight color now then I'll take some more that lavender and we'll set it right here and we'll put less white into that much less and that'll be our shadow color now we have highlight and shadow both tell you what since we got the shadow color on a knife this will start with that little roll of paint let's go right up here maybe the lights coming from the left today what the heck and we'll go right in here and I just want to put a little bit of shadow indication don't much justice very small amount and don't worry about these trees because anything we don't like we'll just paint right over there now then back to our highlight color and begin looking at this begin picking out little individual things in here maybe this one comes right down like so absolutely no pressure at all no pressure but it just sort of flowed through here maybe it comes down mmm they just disappear man back here won't change the small and I can get back in these little places the little small knife really works for wonders there we go and we can drop a few little shadows here and there just a few just a few maybe there's another little peak it lives right there wherever you are into your world you place them wherever you feel that they should be yeah a little bit of a shadow color we need a distinct shadow behind here just like there a little touch more hair in there there now then let me clean the brush here dirty default my brushes wash it off put a good shake and is beat the devil at it now very lightly very lightly I want to tap this following the angles and then lift upward upward upward upward this will make it very soft and very distant over here follow these angles there we go and we haven't destroyed this light areas it looks like a little glow there okay that's enough for a mountain it's not very important in this painting it's just there just cause it looks nice let's take let's take some black little Prussian blue some say little green one more thing little green there we go just looking for very dark colors let me wipe off the old knife grab fan brush this is a beautiful painting and unlike most of them I know exactly what this one's going to be since we used it in the opening it only takes a few minutes to to paint those little rascals in the opening but it takes a lot of fantastic people a long time to put that together we just make the indication of some distant trees far far away there we go see now that little area right there isn't that beautiful it just makes those trees jump out at you there hmm maybe a few of these trees maybe they got a little more sunlight a little more water and they got a little bigger and you can see a little more detail in them just a few here and there one or two or in your painting maybe you want more than one or two whatever it's up to you now then let me find a clean brush I want to create the illusion down here of mist this is going to be our waterfall right in here so I want that to have mist right up here on top of it let's take we just go into a light color white or whatever you get just a very light color tap a little bit of paint into the bristles and just very gently here begin tapping in some color just tap it okay me I beat the brush just to remove excess paint now then just want to start blending it all together let me clean the brush just beat the devil out of it that's most fun part of this now we can very gently see how soft that is a clean brush now we'll begin creating the illusion of the mist here that it just sort of float around have fun there it goes wherever you want there and maybe there'll be a little bit in here I don't know wherever you want where we can add more mist as we go now maybe maybe open here there's some big rocks let's do some big rocks get a fan brush let's take we use some Van Dyck Brown blue dark see how to in it what the heck little crimson - I like crimson that's a nice color little little in the fan brush now we have to make some major decisions where does our rocks live here maybe maybe okay let's come right in here maybe our rock lives right there this is going to be very difficult to see because it's so dark all I'm doing is just painting in a basic shape of the rock that's on the other side of the waterfall that's all I'm trying to do just very basic and we're going to put the waterfall in front of it so for that let's take a little white a little crimson a little touch of blue just sort of mix them together we'll just use a fan brush and then go up here touch and begin shaping your rock just using the old fan brush and we'll come back with a knife and highlight some of this and then brush it all I'm doing is just putting in some very basic little shapes right now very very basic there begin separating these rocks and you could almost sculpt them now then let's take we use the knife here a little touch of the dark sienna all those nice colors get a tiny little roll of paint I want a very little color on this very little color and I'm just going to let it sort of skip and bounce and play barely barely touching the canvas almost and nothing is happening there with a nice clean brush and one hair and some air just light very light barely touch it and pull it in the shape of the rock in other words if the rock comes this way you don't want to pull it across it'll mess up your rock nothing worse than a messed up rock maybe anywhere you want to put a little bump see you can just drop it in give it a little pull and that easy that easy okay now that's really let's let's get down to the fun part of this now today I'm going to dip this one-inch brush right into some of the liquid clear and take it right into titanium white now this will thin the paint and make it smooth and make it flow very very smooth very smooth okay let's go ahead up here now major decision has to be made at this point come right up here you have to make a decision on where your waterfall lives may be right here touch go see there it's all there is to it touch okay here we go you don't make those little noises though it won't work hmm touch tune now maybe maybe maybe in our world maybe this little stone lives right here watch right here see if you want to place a little stone here we just take a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown or whatever dark color put a little stone there we'll come back and very lightly up on top here with a little light would strike will put a little touch of highlight and now we have a happy little stone that lives out there and he watches the waterfall he has a good time because he can watch all the creatures there we go let's go back up here now touch see there goes our waterfall again touch just wherever you want it now you can do this with a 2 inch brush if you wanted to I like to use a little 1 inch brush it gives you a little more control there but notice down in here I'm not putting a lot of color I want the color to be up here where the light would strike and down here would be softer much softer down and darker darker there but you see how that liquid clear which is it allows that paint just a slide just as smooth as glass and you can just keep to but your shape and form here is most most important most important that we can come back we'll find the old fan brushes come right up in here maybe up in here lives big rock Tim he comes down to and all we're doing here is just applying some nice dark color so we have something for a rock to live on let me get the knife girl pile up a little color a little bit of crimson a little crimson little blue we'll throw some white into it there we are don't over mix the paint leave it leave it sort of marbled tune that way you have a multitude effects happening automatically okay come up here just like we did before and now we begin forming this big rock lives right in here just drop him in use a fan brush to put in some very basic little shapes there maybe there's a big ledge yeah right there you're right you're right now then back to our knife take some of these colors and just let them skip and bounce just barely touch barely whisper whisper quiet barely barely touching barely touching just want to create some few little highlights here and there don't overdo leave these rocks quite dark now then with our two inch brush once again following the angles in the rock one hair and some air that's light in it there we go and that easy we can create a rock big maybe maybe there's a big ledge comes out here just let them go wherever you think they should live just drop them in one after the other as many as you want or as few as you want this might be on the simplest ways I've ever come up with just to create the illusion of a lot of stones large stones back to our knife a little bit of ran out of color there a little bit of dark sienna little yellow ochre lavender whatever and just barely touching it whisper whisper a little more paint like just drop right alone there we go okay a little bit right in here let all those little colors just happen and back to our 2 inch brush and caress it just caress it there it goes now maybe in our world maybe maybe maybe I just had an idea maybe it'll get a little SAP green there we go let's tap a little bit of color right into the tip of the bristles maybe right in here maybe there's a little bush lives right here there he is just a happy little Bush he sets right down here he gets a lot of water because this water all it creates all kind of little misty things oh he's busy down here there we are just just going to let me clean another brush here I got too many dirty brushes here we go now back to my large brush with a little white I'm gonna come down here and just tap in a little bit of color we want to create the illusion of mist there now knock off all that excess we can come back and begin softening I get very soft very quiet just sort of blends up here it's always a lot of mist when water falls is far you can bet this mist can just absolutely without question you know there's going to be missed in here just sort of floats around add a little layer just using the top corner of a two inch brush and you can create that effect maybe just find a fan brush little touch of the liquid clear right into the titanium white maybe down here maybe the water hits and you can see it coming out of the Mist and maybe there's an stones down here shoot maybe you want to show there's a stone yeah sorry if you want to stone there take a little brown put your little stone in there or two or ten it's up to you but as many or as few stones as you want in your waterfall little highlight on that stone so it stands out there use a small edge of the knife and give him shape texture maybe that part sneaks right around to comes right down around that stone it's splashing right down in the front here we don't know where it comes from it's coming from the Mist back in here just all kinds of little things are happening there we are here we are and take our clean brush and just tap it a little bit around the edges to mist it up ting now to creat splashes push upward Bend that brush so it bends upward it'll create the illusion of splashes going on all down in here like a taxi color just jumps alive because we have all that underneath is liquid clear under there and then is that lavender color and it really just comes alive on the very bottom up a little bit of darks and I hope I mentioned that a little bit of dark Sienna just to change the flavor as it comes on down here there we go she would get him crazy here so nice all right I mean exceptional color here whatever dark it was and they lo green and blue and black all those nice colors yeah take the old fan brush let's go back up top here that's time we start making some big decisions this tree lives right here in front of the mountain it has a spectacular view spectacular view just use the corner of the brush come right on down and I'm not putting a lot of branches on it I want to leave some area so I can see through that and still see that beautiful mountain back here and then this tree right in here there we are and let's just let him work his way right on down right on down in there end up in here see that black gesso has most of that already painted for you so it really works well okay Randy works well let's go on the other side over here and we'll decide what's over there we'll take a little brown a little white a lavender just mix them all up on the fan brush here doesn't matter whatever you get over here that's come right in here make some big cliffs and rocks and all kinds of happy things there it is right in front of the waterfall gotta make those little noises it comes right on down there we are see just all kinds of little things going on in there there just think about form and shape of your rocks but don't kill all this dark area it's so so important here there's maybe another little thing right in there wherever in your world you decide we'll take the little knife and let's come back in here and once again I just want to let it barely touch just tap a little color but follow those basic angles that you put in there just follow those angles there there we go see write them down wherever you want then we take our big brush and very lightly barely touching again and just move that paint blend it create a big rock there we go back to our breasted head that we made the little bush with maybe we want to push on this side too I don't want him left out little green yellow I come back in here and there's a happy little Bush it loops here maybe he's got a friend that's right there and all I'm doing is tapping down for the top corner a big old two-inch brush okay here and there a little bit more the white paint very little paint I want to create that Miss the illusion you just sort of let these blend together and I'm beating the brush only to remove excess paint that's all there now you can sort of gives the impression that you can see through there and see some of that green a bit of mist over in here that's sort of floating around fantastic there we are maybe in our big tree up here tell you what we can just use a fan brush since I have it already dirty using that same green color put out a few little Leone's and there we go wherever you want wherever you are we need a trunk in this big tree so we just take the fan brush a little brown and white on it soon get right on there maybe's a big old tree he leaves right there I'm right up there take a liner brush with some of that same color little paint thinner put in the indication here and there a happy little limb happy little limb now then we can take take a little white and we'll use a little a little bit of this color right in here I want it to get too bright I want is to remain sort of dark add a little yellow to it oh there we go that turns a beautiful dark dark green that's what I'm looking for okay up in here and then we'll just put the indication of a few highlights that we can see just using the old fan brush when you could very well have done this with a one-inch brush or two inch brush I just happen to have this dirty doesn't really matter there give the indication of some nice blooms and some branches hanging out here there we go they're a little more Rock things here just it really helps if you're sort of nervous want to darken that up just a wee bit if you're a little nervous it's an asset here okay clean off the old knife let me wash off a fan brush here and we'll take we will take a little touch of the liquid clear titanium white the clear is in there only to thin the paint and let's bring us all these things right out in here let it begin picking up all those little beautiful colors maybe this just sort of ripples float right on away we don't know where it goes wherever you want it to you but that's beginning to hit that dark Sienna a little Indian yellow in there too dark Sienna in daniela all those little things just happen automatically this really makes a spectacular painting i hope you've enjoyed this one because the old clock on the wall tells me it's about time for us to leave you for the day but we'll be back next time hopefully we'll have another surprise for you I really hope you try this one and if you do drop me a line send me a photograph of head comes out I'd love to hear from you and from all of us here happy painting and god bless my friend you you
