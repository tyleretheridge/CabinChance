"Hi. I'm certainly glad you could join us today. It's a fantastic day here and I hope it is
wherever you're at. Let's start out today and have them run all
the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that I'll show you what
I've got done up here. Today I have my standard old double primed
pre-stretched canvas. I'm using 18x24 but you use whatever size
is convenient for you, and I've covered the entire canvas with a very thin, even coat
of the liquid white. The liquid white is just designed to make
the canvas wet. It's an oil-based medium that makes it wet. That's all. "
"We're ready to go. Today let's start with our little 2 inch brush,
and we'll go right up here into the phthalo blue. I like phthalo blue. It's a very, very pretty blue and we'll pull
a little bit of that out, just a little phthalo blue. Let's go right up in the sky and let's just
dance in a beautiful little sky using this gorgeous, gorgeous color. There. See we just work all the way across and then
begin blending downward and automatically, automatically the color will blend with the
liquid white that's on the canvas and we get lighter and lighter toward the horizon. As you know, in a landscape that's exactly
what we're looking for. We want the color to get lighter toward the
horizon. There we go. Something about like that. Then, very gently we can just go across to
take out the little brushstrokes, but notice intentionally I have left some little light
areas in here. That will come out looking like little clouds
in the sky or little wispy things that just float through the air. "
"What the heck, let's have a little water in this one. Let's take a little bit of the phthalo blue,
I might even add a touch, a very small amount, of the phthalo green, and a little bit of
black just to darken it. Okay. Let's go back up in here. As I say, maybe we'll have some water in here. I don't know exactly where it's going to be
but wherever we already have our blue color down. We just put water wherever we want it and
where it's not supposed to be we'll just paint right over it. No big deal. There. As you know, we don't make any mistakes. We have some happy accidents sometime and
we learn to work with those. Okay, now then. Let me wash the old brush. I just like to get even with the camera people
and this is my time. All right. Shake it off and we got them. All right. That's the most fun part of this whole thing. "
"If you wanted to put the indication of a happy little cloud in the sky you could just
take and tap a little white on your brush. I don't want big clouds in this painting I
don't think, just a little. Be right back, put a little touch of pink
in there just to warm it up. You could go up in here and as I say, if you
wanted a cloud indication you could do it just by doing something like this. Little bit of white with a touch of pink in
it, but I don't want a lot of clouds in this painting. I think today, tell you what, let's try doing
some fantastic mountains, something that's a little different and give you a little a
challenge in your life and I think you'll enjoy it. There. Now just pull those and blend them a little
bit. That's a nice way of making little wispy soft
clouds. There we go. We're in business. We get to wash the brush again. There. "
"We're back. All right. Today, let's see. Let's take some midnight black, alizarin crimson,
more crimson, more crimson, maybe a little touch of the phthalo blue in it too. I want something in the reddish lavender hue. Shoot, let's get crazy. This is our world and we can do anything in
our world that we want. Cut off a little roll of paint; have it living
right on the edge of the knife. Come right up in here. Maybe we got a big mountain, we do now, that
lives right there, just wherever. Let's have a lot of mountains. Let's play with some mountains today. Push that paint right into the fabric. Just get right in there and push it in. This is where you take out all your frustrations
and hostilities. There's another one. Just get up in there and push it in. The only thing we're concerned with is this
nice top edge. We don't even care what's happening down below,
at least at this point. Maybe down through here. We'll have another one here. I didn't know we was going to make a whole
range of mountains but that's okay. Sometimes it starts working good and you just
don't know when to stop. Okay. "
"Now, let me get a big brush. I want to grab this and pull it. I do this always nearly in mountains because
it does two things, it removes excess paint and it blends that color down just mixing
with that liquid white. Automatically it gets lighter toward the base
and in a landscape that's all we're looking for. There. You can sort of use brushstrokes here to figure
out angles and highlights in your mountain. You can see these things. I don't know if they show up well on TV but
you can see them. It's a super way of laying out your whole
mountain without being committed in the least. There. Just using the brushstrokes. When you paint you'll understand if you can't
see it. Sometimes it's hard to make out on television. There. About like that. Okay. Then we get to wash the brush again. That's really what I want to do today. This is your lesson in brush washing. We're ready now. "
"Today, let's take titanium white; put a little bright red in it. Don't want too much. Bright red is so strong; eat up your whole
world in a heartbeat. There we go. Maybe I'll put a little of that mountain color
we used in there to dull it down so it's not quite so bright. Yeah, that's better. I like that better. Sometimes it can get so bright it hurts your
eyes, have to wear sunglasses when you paint. There. Okay. Now, let's have maybe ... Let's go this direction
today. I just want a little hint. I don't want a bright mountain today. I just want a little hint of color in here. Very gentle, very gentle. See? Just decide where these things are and let
them go. There we are. Okay. There. Get that edge a little better. See there? Very gentle though, just barely, barely caressing
the canvas. Barely caressing it. I made that a little brighter because in my
mind maybe the light's zinging right up through there. There we go. If one's brighter than you want it just rub
it a little bit. It'll go away. It'll go away no problem. A little bit over in here. Something about like that. All right. "
"Now then, have to start making some big decisions. Where's all these things happening? There. Just play with color. Painting is so much fun when you play with
color, and you can make any kind of world you want. It can be real, it can be fantasy, it can
be something that exists only in your mind, and maybe that really is ... Oh, I hit a little
blue there. Let's use it. See, that's one of them happy accidents. I like it. There. See how we can just do that? That'll create a nice soft misty little effect
down there. Just using the knife to blend. There. See how soft that looks? All right. "
"Now, take a little white, a little touch of the prussian blue. Prussian blue is quite dark. Maybe I'll even put a little black in it. Oh, that's good. That's good. Not much though. Not much. Want the least little hint. We'll go right up in here. We'll just put the least little hint here. I don't want a lot of shadow color in this. Just some here and there. Maybe a little bit lighter just so it shows
up there. How's that? There we go. Maybe over in here just a little touch. There. This painting will give you a lot of practice
using the knife and making some big old mountains look gorgeous. I'll just jump back and forth between highlight
and shadow here and in places let them mix together. It's all right. You can do anything that you want here, any
old thing that you want. There we go. Make another little bump right there just
by doing something like that. See, it makes it nice deep, airy in there. "
"I'm going to take a little yellow ochre, least little touch of bright red in it. I want the least little touch maybe here and
there of some orangey color. Don't want much, just the least little touch
right in there. There. See there? Just to warm it up a little here and there. Back over in here we need a little something
back in this little goober. There it is. All right. There. I have one of my favorite people in the world
is my aunt Suzy who lives in Georgia. She's all the time saying, "There's a little
goober right there." I think a little goober means a little peanut. In Georgia goober is a peanut. There we go. All right. We can just put these wherever. Okay. Little highlights and shadows. "
"Now, you can spend a lot of time just playing like this and putting in all kinds of little
nice things wherever you want them. Little dark color here and there and then
just take and sort of work them in. Looks like all kinds of things that are happening
in your mountain. Why them some rugged looking old rascals already. There. See there? Just sort of blend them with the knife. There. I'm just really pushing very hard. You can probably hear how hard I'm pushing
on the canvas. A little bit of that shadow color and just
blending it in. There we go. Don't want to spend the whole show just playing
with mountains but I thought you'd like to see some mountains that are a little different
and a little more fun. Sometimes these are just something different
to do. There. I like to put these little dark areas in because
it makes all kinds of nice things. There we are. Something like that. I'm going to put a little ... By now you should
see how we make them. "
"I want to introduce you to a fantastic lady while I'm finishing up this little mountain. I tell you, I work with a lot of the rehab
people all over the country. This lovely lady's name is Cindy and she's
right outside of Orlando, Florida. She allowed me to come out and film some of
her animals. This is a little Sandhill crane. They think when it was in egg it's neck got
twisted up, and it probably will never be able to be released but gorgeous ladies like
Cindy devote their whole life to just taking care of God's little creature like this. She has all kind of creatures out there. If you saw the owl earlier, that belonged
to her. That's a baby that she's getting ready to
release. Probably by the time you see this he'll be
out living on his own someplace having a good time. I have the greatest admiration for people
who devote their whole lives to them. "
"Now see here's Cindy showing me the biggest squirrel I have ever seen in my life. This is called a Sherman fox squirrel. I think they're quite rare. There's not may of them left. I'm just tapping the bottom of the mountain
here. There's not many of them left, and she has
one that is so tame that he's just unbelievable. He is gorgeous. His name's Little Bit. I don't know there's nothing little about
him. He's as big as a small kitty cat. There. All right. Look at the tail on this rascal. He is something else. As I say, his name is Little Bit. Isn't he something else? "
"There. Okay. That's about all I'm going to do on these
mountains. That's very simple little mountain to do. I think you'll like it, and it's a little
bit different than some of them that we've done. Tell you what, let's take ... What do we got? Black, prussian blue, phthalo green, I like
phthalo green, put it right in there and put some crimson in with it. Oh. A lot of nice rich, rich dark color. Let's make some trees. Grab the old fan brush and we just fill it
full of color, lot of color in it, both sides. Okay, let's go right up here to the canvas. Big decision time. In our world does now lives a happy little
tree. I'm going to push upward, make little pushy
up trees. Just use a corner of the brush, push upward. That phthalo green in there just gives it
a nice little affect. I like that. I like that. You can use sap green in there or phthalo. It's up to you. Sometimes I use sap green. Sometimes I use phthalo. Depends on what your mood is what flavor you're
looking for. "
"Painting is such an individual thing. Even from day to day my mood changes. What turns me on one day may turn me off the
next. There. That's why painting is so fantastic. It's one of the few things that you never
seem to get bored with because if you've painted for a thousand years you'd know that you're
next painting is going to be your masterpiece. I hope you're plagued with this discontent. By discontent I mean I hope you're plague
with never, never in your life being satisfied with a painting that you do because as long
as you're not totally satisfied then you'll continue to strive to be better and you learn
from each experience. I really believe that if you painted for a
million years there'd be one more thing that you could learn. There. "
"I've painted since I was about 19 years old. Did my first oil painting when I was about
19, and to this day I have not even scratched the surface. I travel all over the country. I like to go to museums and look at some of
the fantastic works that artists have done for a long time. One day I hope to see an original painting
by Leonardo da Vinci. He, to me, is the greatest painter who has
ever lived. He's just my personal hero. I think the man was just so gifted, so gifted
not only in painting but in engineering, think in about anything he tried. "
"There we go. I'm just painting these a little backwards
here. We'll pull them down in a second and you'll
have some little reflection going right in there. There they are. There. What we're looking for is just basic shape. Okay. Clean, dry, 2 inch brush, grab it, pull straight
down gently, gently. See there? Those basic shapes remain. Then go across. That easy. That easy. Maybe in our world back here we'll take some
black and some van dyke brown. Maybe, yep. Maybe we had some nice stones that live back
here. We'll put in some dark color first. Something about like that. Doesn't matter. Then we'll come back. Take a little bit of white, little bit of
dark sienna, maybe even a touch of the yellow ochre in there. There. Just various colors here. I'm just looking ... Oh, got a little blue
in it too. That's all right I guess. Doesn't much matter. Just barely touch. Just let the knife sort of graze here and
there. Don't cover it all up. Just let it bounce and touch and find little
places. The paint's thick. It'll pick out little places in there. "
"All right. I got several fan brushes. I'm going to grab another one, put some sap
green, some indian yellow, yellow ochre, all the different yellows and greens in here. Something like that. Let's go up in here and there and here and
here and there I'll pop in, just pushing upward, a few little bushy areas that live right along
in here. Maybe there's a bush lives there. See? See? There he is. You put them wherever you want them. Wherever you want them. Take a little bit of brown and white on the
knife, put the indication here and there of a little trunk, stick. You can scrape right through, put in a few
things like that. "
"Back to our bush that has the green on it. There we are. Make it a little darker. We come back in here and pop in a few little
highlights. Don't want many. I want this to remain quite dark back in here. There. Just a few. Just a few. There's one. See? A few little highlights on some of these little
trees. Want it to stay dark though. I like that back there. There. Pushing upward though, just bending it upward. All right. Shoot. We coming right along here. A little liquid white. There. Cut across. Let's come right in there put the indication
of a little water line. Actually it's just a light color that breaks
up between these two dark areas. There. See? Just run it across like that. Something like that. There. All right. Okay. "
"Time to get serious here. Got to do the other side. I like doing them big stones and our whirl,
you ready? Here we go. Big stone lives right there. Big stone. This is just brown, black, something like
that. We go back to that old highlight color that
we had. Just sort of let that fall right along ... Just
barely graze it. Just barely graze it. Just let it pick up on the high parts of that
paint. Paint's very thick. Just worry about basic shape here, that's
all. That's all we're worried about. I'm going to put some big trees and stuff
in there anyway so we don't have to worry too much. Might even cover up part of it. Pull some of it down. Make us a little reflection that lives right
there. "
"Let's see here. Let's make another big tree over on this side. I don't want it left out. Okay. Let's start right here. Make a big tree. I'm pushing upward using that same tree color
that I used before. There. Make a big strong tree. Not all of them have big points. Maybe we'll have one here that maybe his top's
not so sharp. That happens with evergreens. I've seen some that just look like they got
broke when they were a baby. There. We'll bring it right in front of the rock. There we go. Now then, we'll give him a friend. You know me. I think everybody should have a friend, even
a tree. There we go. I like trees. I like trees. I spend a lot of time out in the woods just
looking and studying trees. There we go. "
"Let's see here. Tell you what; let's just fill all this in
with some dark stuff. Maybe we'll have some nice grassy areas right
here. I don't know. If you put it in then you're going to do something
with it. Doesn't much matter because we can do anything
here. We can change anything, we can add, subtract. Just figure out where you want to be reflections,
where you want to be ground and do it. Just do it. Take a little brown and white and maybe here
and there in this old tree you can see a little trunk. A little bit over in here. Get our fan brush that had the green on it,
and we can go back in here and just pop the indication here and there of some gorgeous
little highlights in this tree. There. This one has a little more yellow ochre in
it. There we go. It's a little different flavor. Just change the flavor a little bit. All right. The other little tree needs something too. Don't want much on him because he's probably
behind that one. All right. "
"Maybe we'll just take ... Let me dip that into a little touch of the paint thinner. He'll go into a little of that green color
we have here and all the yellows, a little bright red here and there. Tap a little color into the bush. Maybe there's a little grassy area. Yep. Yep Yep, you're right. Lives right there. See it? Just a happy little area. This is a nice place just to kick your shoe
off and run through the grass here with bare foots. I like to do that. I like to do that. Just all kinds of little things going on in
here wherever. Wherever. See? You make the decision where those things are. Something about like that. "
"Tell you what, let's grab the old 1 inch brush. We'll get crazy. Got a second left. We'll go right into some yellow ochre. I want a nice tree, lives right there. We can use just plain yellow ochre because
we already have some dark back there. Maybe there's a little tree that lives right
there and he's got a friend that lives right here. See? Something like that. Take a little brown and just put a few little
indications of some trunks in there like that. Shoot. We coming along pretty good here. Okay. Take a little bit of the liquid white. Let's just come in here, put on a little waterline,
something like so. Shoot. I think we about have a finished painting. It's a very easy painting. I hope you tried because it's a good study
in doing mountains. Scratch in a few little sticks and twigs and
you're masterpiece is finished. "
"Hope you've enjoyed this one. From all of us here I'd like to wish you happy
painting and God bless my friend. "
