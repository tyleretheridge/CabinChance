Oh hello I'm Bob Ross and I'd like to welcome you to the 15th joy of painting series first of all I'd like to thank you for inviting me back for another series of painting shows and if this is your first time with us let me extend a personal invitation for you to get out your brushes and paint along or tell you I just dragged up the old easy chair and spend a relaxing half-hour enjoying some of nature's masterpieces we're painting with about a dozen oil colors a few unorthodox brushes and in each program I'll try to show you how easy it is to paint and how much fun you can have doing it so I'll tell you what let's start out today and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this little picture with me and while they're doing that let me tell you what I've already got done up here I've got my standard old 18 by 24 pre-stretch to canvas and onto that I've put a thin even coat of the liquid white so it's all wet and slick and ready to go so let's do a fantastic little painting together I'm gonna start out they with the old 1 inch brush here and go into the smallest little amount of the CAD yellow thought I'd do a little winter little winter scene today Reeth right over here and get a touch of the red have a little bit of bright red and CAD yellow on the 1 inch brush just mix them on the brush what the heck let's go right up here maybe maybe we'll have a little Sun up here in the sky so decide basically where your son's gonna live maybe right about in there I ran it along and there we just drop that in and we're just looking for sort of a circular shape and I'll wash the brush and if you've painted with us before you know we always we always wash our brushes with odorless thinner be sure it's odorous here to run everybody in the neighborhood away now then let's have some fun take titanium white be right back reach up here get a little touch of your lizard crimson a little bit more maybe there we go little lizard crimson happy little color now then right around this first little circle I'm going to use little crisscross strokes and just throw in a little bit of color like so just like so a little bit open here there we go see but use these little crisscross strokes we're going to blend all this together and if you just draw a big circle around here it's a son of a gun to try to blend it together and the little crisscross strokes they blend pretty easy alright and that's pretty already it's just some nice warm color sometimes winter scenes can be so cold that they're either not they're not fun to look at so I like to put a little touch of warmth into into my little winter scene I'm going to add the least little amount I have not washed a brush a little amount a phthalo blue right into that crimson and white so it makes sort of a lavender color let's go back up here now that right around here we'll just add a little bit of that just like so still using a little crisscross strokes there a little more of the blue and a little more of the crimson and practice just mixing your colors on the on the palate using a brush that way you don't end up with one old dead color there's excitement happening in your brush there yes and we're just sort of blending all those together I take it what I'm gonna reach right up in here and get a little touch of a midnight black little touch a black there okay let's just put a little bit of that right in the corner here and Adil dark in these edges bring it all together a little bit for the other side like so now then now that would take a 2 inch brush and be sure it's good and dry be sure it's dry cuz you don't want your color to run we use a very firm dry thick oil paint here and we want it to stay as dry as possible so we can blend color while it's still wet there now just using still the crisscross strokes I want to blend this to where you can't tell where one color stops and the next color starts it makes a very soft beautiful sky it has some nice colors in it there we go see there a little bit over here which you always blend from the light area out light out yeah we got a little hair right there would just pop him right off if you get a hair on your canvas just take the corner of the brush and pop him off okay now then let me grab a fan brush let's get crazy today I'm going right back into that black just put some color right into the fan brush just black you agree tip here and get a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown if you want to mainly black okay maybe in our world maybe there's a happy little cloud it lives oh this gonna be a big cloud comes right around there it is like so maybe right I'm down here tell you what let's do let's put a Sun in there for that I just use my finger and a little bit of titanium white that yellow color that we put in first the reddish in the yellow that becomes the aura around the Sun now then turn my back up here I'm gonna take my knife and just zip it off the value still remains in the canvas or that the light spot there okay and maybe there's another little cloud and I'm just using little rocking strokes here maybe he just lives right there like so and in your painting you decide where all these things live because this is your world right here and you can do anything that your heart desires here maybe that one comes right across any anything that you want to do here let's have some more dark up in here we're gonna come back with a large brush and blend all these out all we're doing now is just applying a little bit of color maybe there's some little stringy streaky clouds that live in here like so same okay just a few here and there and then once again be sure your brush is good and dry and let's come right up in here and just begin blending these and you can blend them to any degree of softness that you want you can blend them till they absolutely become part of the sky but that's really not what we're looking for here we want these to stand out a little bit there we go now as your brush picks up paint you can just give it a good wrap like that and that'll remove that excess paint without without going through the whole entire cleaning procedure again there we go maybe over here okay there knock off that excess paint very lightly right here just barely barely grazing the canvas well you can make a while sky here just just a minute see if it the more you blend it the more it all comes together there we go if any area is too dark or too light change it you can do anything here absolutely anything all right I think we've got a pretty mess of the sky there for just a little quickie so let's have some more fun tell you what let's build a little mountain back here for that I'm gonna take some black some black a little touch of the Prussian blue some brown and Liz ring crimson so we have black blue crimson a little bit of brown pull it out as flat as you can get it go straight down cut across get our little roll of paint now then you have to make a major decision where does your mount and live in your world right there right there it lives I want these mountains to be far away so I don't want them to get too big in proportion to the painting here I like so there now we take a large brush and because this is wet we can literally move color on here so we can grab this and pull it just pull it and it'll mix for the liquid white and automatically automatically your mountain will get lighter in value toward the base and that's what we're looking for looky there that son of a gun just sort of floating around having a good time already that easy there we go now we can take let's take a let's take let's take a little bit of titanium white powders out flap don't put the least little touch of the bright red into at least little touch I don't want to set these on fire just want to give it a little pinkish hue pull without flat and once again our little roll of paint now then barely touch the canvas barely touch see there and you have to make some big decisions here words light gonna strike your Mountain maybe yep right there wherever you want it that's where it or to be you went to paint to break if I break I mean have all these little holes in it and that's done by a very very delicate little touch oh you just barely craze in a canvas and has teaching my son Steve to pay nice to telling just pretend he was a whisper and he floated right across the mountain that easy gentle make love to it caress it there you go see if you can do anything here and the secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it anything that you believe you can do strong enough you can do anything as long as you believe take a little they low blue and white here just mix it together and once again flat our little tiny rule of paint then let's put up a little shadow here here and there still that delicate little touch don't like a touch a little bit right in there like so and that easy you can make those little mountains just pop right out and you can you can go back and add little bumps and Peaks and whatever you want in there there we are see okay now cleaned right to enterprise I want to tap the base of that there we go just tap it like so and then very gently very gently lift upward there there we are okay and tell you what I've got them here's a dirty brush we'll just use it I'm gonna go back into that same color I used to make the mountain same old color take the old 2 inch brush add a little white to it and just load a little color right onto the 2 inch brush there just tap it firmly shoot okay now that maybe there's a little back in here yep you're right there lives a little Foothill right here just using the corner to brush and tapping gently downward like so see it's all there is to it maybe it goes we don't know where it goes over here what the heck what the heck and we take a one inch brush and lift upward here and there short tiny little strokes tiniest of strokes okay now if you want to create the illusion of mist under there take the 2 inch brush take the top corner of it and just have it firmly right on the bottom just tap it then lift gently upward okay maybe maybe in our world tell you what maybe there's another row of foothills there go back to the same color only add more of the dark I want this to be a little bit darker as things get closer to you in a landscape they should get a little darker there something that easy you can drop in another row and each time you put in a row of little foothills like is it creates another plane in your painting and it helps create that illusion of distance and half right here on the base and that'll give us our misty effect lift upward shoot that easy look at him and then maybe just put some snow in there we go right in I'm just using the same old 2 inch brush we'll go right in some titanium white get the least little touch be right back here these little touch of the phthalo blue just enough to give the white a little coolness okay yeah maybe we said this was gonna be winter so come right up here and watch you have to decide where your snow is gonna live see there these little touch of the blue in their net that just gives it a feeling of a little cold ice no one to get to warm snow it all melt runoff on your floor and make a big puddle there we go and I see something back here when you're painting with this method you'll learn very quickly that you see things are happening in it you get all excited you can change your mind right in midstream I see a place for nice trees I will take some black Prussian blue and Van Dyke Brown blue black and brown mix it up let me clean my knife off here and tell you what we're disused a small fan brush is number three a fan brush loaded full of color both sides a lot of paint kaylynn scoop here maybe their lives in our world and he lives right there just a happy little evergreen yeah give it a little upward push they're just push upward I want these limbs to go there see that that fantastic you can build a tree that easy you can let's give him a friend I don't want this little tree to be lonely you know me I think everybody deserves a friend Fran sir may be the most precious commodity we have there we go now then to blend this right into the snow I'm gonna take some white and grab it grab the bottom of it with a brush and allow some of that color back there see yeah we can set him right up on a little hill there we go see a member old song says on the hill far away there it is that's a hill far away now once in a while I'm gonna add the least little touch of alizarin crimson to my color and that'll warm it we have cold colors the blue and white now we'll put a little bit of the crimson and warm it here and there like his little sunlight this is hanging right across there just warm it nah okay you find that little brush again shoot oh so much fun this must make a bigger tree still using the number-3 fan brush but you could use number six number three whatever doesn't make any difference long as it works for you maybe in our world there lives right up here by the Sun boy he's up here checking out the Sun right there another tree this one's going to be closer to us so proportionately it'll be bigger it'll be bigger and make him look like she's closer be careful that you don't cover up the Sun shoot you work so hard to put it in there look at that Santa tree lives right in your brush all you got to do is just push him out and we'll decide maybe he lives right down to there and let's give him a friend to peace or a crooked there that's a crooked tree we'll send him to Washington there we go push up another little friend dad easy katie-ann and then let's put a tree trunk here near for that take a little white a little dark sienna mix them together pull them out very flat cut across and once again our little roll of paint there we are and just touch here and there just let the indication of a little tree trunk a little bit back in here these are far away so you're not gonna see this much detail you take this point behind he just cut through here and there put in the indication of a little stick twig whatever you want that easy there don't wash my little brush here and for the little brush I don't beat it I just wipe it on a paper towel there it's not as much fun to beat and bang on it it's too small okay I'll take some I'm gonna use some white and phthalo blue just mix them with a brush shoot no big deal white.they little blue can't go back up here maybe on these little trees we just put the indication of some highlights with this just to make them really stand out don't kill all your dark don't kill all your dark that contrast is so pretty that dark color against all these nice bright colors okay maybe a little touch back in here no one a whole bunch back here want to keep detail away from these cuz I want them to have that illusion of distance there maybe a little more right in there wherever you want to Navin I'm a brush come right up under the bottom of that tree there let's have some fun take a little bit of our titanium white I want to grab that and pull allowed to pick up a little bit of that color you'll see there and once again it's unreal how about just grabbing a little touch of that color you can make all the kinds of beautiful effects in the snow now one thing you might have noticed it when I'm doing winter trees it's a very rare that I ever put any green until because of green gets into your snow it just doesn't it just doesn't look right the only thing the only thing worse than worse the earth in yellow snow is green snow so it's very rare I've used green in these trees alright white see that a little bit of color helps separate all that there we are okay let's get crazy today shoot anyone I'm gonna grab now let me go around brush it maybe there's some big trees that live here I'm gonna take a little the Van Dyke brand some dark sienna and I'm just going to tap the round brush into it just tap it just tap it let's go right in here I'm gonna start at the base of these trees and work upward that way the darkest area will be down here that will give the indication the shadows my shadows happen and you have to make a big decision here where does your tree live how tall is it just healthy sit not sit dead live you have to make all these big decisions there we go maybe comes right on down wherever dead in the matter he just put it where you want it and let's call the other side and have a happy little tree over there - maybe right here see there I didn't put trees wherever you want them in your world maybe this comes right up here there and then take my script liner brush put some paint thinner and go right into the brown I want this to be as thin as ink a lot of paint thinner okay I've been hearing there let's just put the indication of a little tree trunk it's going big tree on the other side here and it needs something to see just a happy little tree trunk here in there there maybe here and there you can see the indication of just little things some of them are coming clean up over it adds interest in detail to your painting go back into my yellows here we'll take a nice little touch of yellow ochre and I'm just going to tap it right into the bristles a little bit of the bright red but very little of the red okay and then a yellow ochre and I'm just gonna put the indication of a little highlight just right up here on the tree and think about form and shape and its limbs in there they create all kinds of beautiful little things to happen like they're round brush will do fantastic things for you super for making trees and bushes there okay maybe a little touch right out right out there wherever wherever don't want much I don't want this to get too bright just an indication a little bit over in here to once again pay attention to your form and shape that'll that'll really make your tree special that's what makes you happiest on that son-of-a-gun works and you can see all those little bushes and stuff in there there we go now back to my big brush and I'm going to grab this and just like where the evergreens I'm gonna pull a little touch of that color right out into my painting it'll look like shadows under there they're a little bit right there if you painted with it before you know hmm we don't make mistakes we have we have happy accidents Shh sir secret don't tell anybody I'm going back to my liner brush go back right into that good old Bandag brown get it very thin very thin just see a good place right here shoot maybe the old farmer that used to farm out here maybe he had a fence like so just take a liner brush maybe that fence goes over the hill look at there now I put some rails on it too - do I do don't make those little noises it don't work like a tap see maybe a little shadow so just touch it give it a little pull mmm did Nestle key and you can really get carried away you take a touch of the liquid white and put the indication up on top here this little snow Lana / whatever okay back into my brown let's go putting indication here in their book just a little stick in a twig so it's a nice way to sort of clean the edges up and add a little interest a little paint thinner I'll go right into some bright red I think will sign this one little sign him right here that when you sign your painting cuz I get letters all times I don't wanna sign my painting in red that's fantastic sign it in any color that you want there's as many different ways to sign your painting as there are artists I think I think I can put this in one of my books one of the most memorable signatures ever seen was a fantastic lady and she used to sign her painting grandpa's wife and it was different and everybody remembered it so come up with your own signature where there'd be a name and initial assemble whatever you want and then special to you and until next time I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and I'll see you again you
