- Hi, welcome back. Certainly
glad you could join us today. Today is the last show of the 24th series, so thought today we'd just do
something that's really nice. Let's start out and
have run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got up here. Today I have my standard
ol' pre-stretched canvas, and I've covered the entire
canvas with black gesso, and allowed that to dry completely. On top of that, after the gesso was dry, I've added a very, very
thin coat of liquid clear. And then I've taken a paper towel and wiped off all the excess. The reason I do the paper
towel wipe off thing is because so many people had wrote and told me they were putting
too much clear on the canvas. And that's easy to do. If you take a paper
towel, and wipe it off, what's left is just right. And the problem is, it's clear, so you can't tell exactly
how much you have on. Alrighty, so we have
that straightened out. Let's have some fun. I'm goin' to take the ol' two-inch brush. I'm goin' to go right over to the blue, get a little phthalo blue
and white mixed together. We'll just mix it right
on the brush. That's fine. And let's go up here in the sky. Maybe in our world today we'll just start right up
in here with a little touch of that phthalo blue and white. Just begin bouncing in a little
bit of color here and there. Just wherever you'd like to have it. There. Just like something a lot
like that. We don't care. There. And if you want it to
get darker and darker, you just apply less pressure, and allow more of the black
gesso to show through. That's all you have to do. It works so fantastic. There we are. I just want a little hint
of blue up in the sky. Maybe we'll do, let's
do a winter scene today. What the heck. Maybe we'll
do a little winter scene. It's a little different. A lot of fun. All right. That's about all I'm gonna
put up there for blue. And we'll wash the brush. Shake it off (laughs) and
just beat the devil out of it. Okay, if you works it good, let's just keep using the
little two-inch brush. Now go into a little bit
of the titanium white. Just plain ol' titanium white. Now I'm gonna tap the top corner right into a little bit of white paint. Let's go back up in here and just using that top corner I just wanna put in the indication of some little cloud
shapes here and there. Something about like that. Wherever. I don't know. We just sort of let them float
around and have a good time. There. The more you tap, the more it's gonna pick up the blue and everything that's underneath. And it'll get lighter
and lighter and lighter. Or less and less paint, I'm sorry. It won't get lighter,
it actually gets darker. But there's less and less paint. Okay, maybe something about like that. This is the easiest way I've found to make little, fluffy clouds, and I've used it throughout this series. There. All right, now then. I'm going to go back to
the ol' two-inch brush. I have another one here
that's nice and clean. And I'm gonna sort of tickle
it, just a little bit. Just enough to stir it up a little bit. Not much. Not much. Little, tiny, tiny x's. There. And we're gonna fluff it a little bit. Barely, barely grazing the canvas. I just can't tell you what
a light touch that is. See there? But that easy. That easy you can make
a happy, little cloud. And maybe this little cloud
has a friend right here. Has a little friend that
lives right here with him. Just sort of floats
around, has a good time. Clouds may be one of the
freest things in nature. There we go. Something, oh i don't know, like that. It's up to you. In your world, you put as many or as few little clouds as you want. Turn the brush sort of
to change the shapes. Let it just disappear
right off over in here. Wherever. And back to the other
brush that's clean and dry. I'm using two two-inch brushes here. One of 'em has paint on it,
the other one's very clean. Very lightly. Give it a little fluff. And barely graze the canvas. But isn't that a
fantastic, easy, little way of making some very
effective, little clouds? And you can do it. You can do it. Maybe down in here, take a little of that bluish color. Maybe we'll put some
dark clouds on top there. Why not? Show you how to do
some nice, little dark clouds. All right. Let me wash the ol' brush again. I just like to wash the brush. There. Okay, let's make a mixture of, we'll use some black, put a little prussian
blue, and alizarin crimson. So we have black, blue, and crimson. There we go. Let me wipe
off the ol' knife here. There. Now, I'll just use the same ol' brush. Tap a little color in the same way. Now we have to make some big decisions. I want some big ol' mean-lookin'
clouds up here in the sky. Big ol' mean ones. Maybe there's a snowstorm coming. There. Just drop these in. You see, the black gesso allows you to do this extremely quick. Takes very little color. Maybe they just sort of
float all down in here. You can bring them right out across these to push those light ones back. Sometimes when there's a big storm comin' in will be very dark, very close in. But you can look through and see the good times right back here. There we go. And that's what we're gonna
try to accomplish here. Just to make it look
way back in the distance there you can see fair weather. Maybe up here where we live it's, whew, the storm's a comin'. Storm's a comin'. There we go. Something right along in here. And all we're doin' is just
tapping on a few basic shapes. That's all I'm looking for right now. No detail. Just very basic, little shapes. Back to our clean brush. I'm just varying back and forth between dirty brush, clean brush. Using just the top corner, very gently, I'm gonna stir these up. Just wanna blend 'em so you can see a little light through 'em. Don't want 'em solid black. There. Every once in awhile
you'll hear me beat the brush, and that's just to remove excess paint. There. Boy, this is gonna be a mean, ol' sky. I can see it comin' now. There. Just knockin' off the paint, 'cause you will pick up
a little paint off here. Okay, just barely, barely
touching the canvas though. There we go. And you can blend this to any degree of softness that you want. I don't want this too soft though because if you blend it together too much, you're gonna lose that effect that there's a big, ol' storm comin'. You can tap it to blend, too. Either way. If you have a lot of time, you can set and tap it
like this until you can create some of the most gorgeous
shapes you've ever seen. There we go. All right. Very lightly now, we'll
just blend the entire sky. Just blend it. But isn't that a neat way
of making a ferocious sky? Oh my gosh, you know something's
fixin' to happen there. And it's very, very simple
when you do it this way. The black gesso on the canvas and a little bit of liquid clear. Really makes you laugh. Your
painting laugh, at least. Much, much easier. Now then, I'll just take another ol', well here's one that's dirty,
we'll just keep using it. I'm gonna make some brown, and for that, use alizarin crimson and sap green in about equal parts. As I've mentioned on some of the other shows in this series, you can take this to the
red side or the green side. Usually I take it a little
bit to the reddish side, but that's a personal preference. Strictly up to you. Strictly up to you. There. Maybe a little bit more red in there. Oh yeah, that's what we're lookin' for. Okay, wipe off the ol' knife here. And I'm just gonna tap
the ol' two-inch brush right into that, just the
corner of the brush right there. There. Maybe there's some little trees
back here in the background. Okay. All we do, I'm just gonna take
the top corner of the brush, and tap in some little basic shapes. Way back in here. There they come. A little more color. There. Wherever you think they should be is exactly where they should be. I'm not lookin' for a lot of detail. It's too far away. We
don't want detail yet. We'll have a lot of
detail in the foreground. But right back here, just want the indication of some happy little trees that
live back in there. And maybe, I'm goin' back
to some alizarin crimson, a little black and
prussian or phthalo blue. Doesn't make any difference. Whichever one you happen to have. I'm just gonna tap the brush in like that. I'm gonna have a little
footy hill back here. A little foothill lives right here. And we'll just tap in a little indication, about like that. Give it a little downward pull. See, I want the bottom to
have that little light area. And on the top, I'm gonna
lift slightly upward. So it looks like little
trees far, far away. And you could probably
just do it like that. Up and down. Create the same effect. But just tiny, little short strokes. Tiny little short strokes. We're gonna add a little more of that phthalo blue to that color. Same color. Same color. But I want it a little bit
more to the bluish side. And maybe, there's a few little happy trees right back in here. There. Something maybe like that. Just so we can see indications. Now right now, it's gonna
be hard to see that. In a few minutes, I'm gonna
put snow underneath there, and you won't believe
how those will show up. Right now they're a little bit dark. Now with our liner brush, some of that nice brown color that we made from the sap green and alizarin crimson. I'm just gonna put the
indication here and there of a few little trunks
in some of these trees. Just some happy little trunks. Maybe even a few that protrude
right up over the top. Wherever. There. I hope you can see
those. They're in there. We know they're in there, and that's the most important thing. Now maybe, that's good and clean. Shoot, let's get crazy. Let us take, we'll use black, prussian blue, alizarin
crimson, all mixed together. There. Let me clean off the ol' knife. Let's make us a few nice, little evergreens that live back there. Maybe just a couple. Maybe just a couple. Load the brush full of color. Lot of paint. Lot of paint. Let's go up in here and make a decision. Our evergreen tree. Just do it. Make a decision and drop
it in. Lives right there. Start with just the corner of the brush. As you work down the tree,
add more and more pressure. Maybe this is a big,
fat tree. What the heck. I'm using the brush almost
straight on this time. I wanna make this tree big and fat. There. Big heavy tree. Nice ol' tree. Got a lot of character. Looks like a Christmas tree. There. I'll just give him a friend. I don't want him to be lonely back here. There. Poor little tree. Didn't want him to be lonely. Didn't want him to be
lonely. There we are. Okay, somethin' about like that. Now then, let me wash
the ol' brush out here. And we just wash this brush
also with odorless thinner and then wipe it on a
paper towel to clean it. That's all there is to it. I'm gonna take some
white, some phthalo blue. Mix it together. Make a nice... put a little more white right there. Yeah, somethin' like that. Now, I'll take the fan brush and dip it into the liquid clear. Dipped it right in the clear. So this is quite a thin paint now. But the big thing is, the clear will make it react
different on the canvas. It'll look different. Let's go up in here. Let's come right along in here, and put some nice, look at that. See, let it bend downward. That's some beautiful, little snow-covered branches out here on this tree. Darker, darker, darker
toward the base, as always. As always. Now, back in the background,
a little more of the clear. I don't want this tree in the
background to be as bright. Don't want you to notice it as much. Just want you to know it's there. So I'm using the darker
color, and much less. Now you know he's back
there and you can see him, but hopefully he didn't stand out and grab all the attention, (laughs) 'cause they'll do that. But the liquid clear is fantastic when you want to really
highlight something where you make an effect like that. Works extremely well. Okay.
(scraping) Take off any excess paint, 'cause we're gonna go right in there. Will just use this ol'
two-inch brush. What the heck. Let's go into titanium white. And we'll load quite a bit, just like we were loading
it to a chisel edge. Just like we was loading
it to a chisel edge. Let's go up in here.
Gotta make a big decision. Where does the snow lay? I think, right under this tree. Pull right across. Just like that. Just like that. And because a little bit
of clear is on there, that'll slide just like glass. If this was dry canvas, it'd have a hard time making
that paint slide on there. It wouldn't be smooth-like.
Yes, that's so smooth. There. And look how it stands out
against that dark color. Shoot. I gotta play a little bit more. I'm gonna take a little bit of
brown, a little white in it. Reach over here, get some paint thinner. I'll make it real thin. So I have just brown. Just brown and little
white with paint thinner. Then I'll make another little pile here that's just basically white
with the least little bit of... Excuse me, let me get a little touch of the paint thinner in that, too. We want both these colors
to be very, very thin. There. Now then, we'll take our liner brush. And we'll go through this color first. Load it full. Then I'll go through this one and just get color on one side. Maybe there's a nice tree that lives here, and we can do both sides
of the tree at one time. We got the light side, and
the dark side at one stroke. Put a few little limbs on him. Not many. Not many. Somethin' maybe like that. Load it again. And maybe we got another
little tree lives right there. That's his friend. That's his friend. We'll put a few little arms on him. There. All right. Just a little tree that's
sittin' back like that. I think today, let's do a
little cabin right in there. That's such a lovely place. Right there at that tree. One of the easiest ways I've found, take your knife, scrape off a basic shape. Ooh, right over the
tree. That's all right. We know how to make him. Maybe he's got a little porch in the back. Maybe it's not even a cabin. Maybe it's an ol' barn or something. I don't know, whatever you want it to be. You make a decision. There we go. Just scrapin' out the excess. Take our brown color and we
just sort of fill that in. We're just blocking in color. Just blocking in color. We're not too concerned
about anything at this point. Okay, we'll take some white, some of that same brown color, maybe even the least
touch of crimson into it. Just warm it up a little. Cut across, get our little roll of paint. Very lightly, barely touchin'. See? We'll make the front
of the cabin. That easy. Take a little bit of dark brown like that. Make the indication of a lot of little boards in there just by touching. Just by touching. Let's
put a door right there. Got a little door for his house. Now... a little bit more of the dark. Over on this side, just a hint. Just a hint. Not much. It's much, much too dark over here. Over on this side,
there's very little light. Now, I'm gonna take pure titanium white and I want it to bounce along here. I want this to look like, I
want it to look rough, raged. If you want it to look smoother, make it in a single stroke. I want it to look like it's just really, snow's just really piled
up there on that old roof. Maybe there's even some holes in the roof. Maybe the ol' house is just deserted. What the heck. Somethin' about like that. Take the small knife.
(scraping) I'm just gonna put the indication of a couple windows
right over on that side. Little white with some gray on it. I made a little brush
with some gray on it. Little outline indication
of a couple of windows. I like that. Now, back to our ol' brush
that has the white on it. Gotta put some snow right
around his little cabin here. There we go. Nobody's home here. There. Something really like that. And here and there we can touch the least little amount of that blue to create a little cool
shadow effect in the snow. There. Just a little
phthalo blue here and there. All right. See, the big ol' brush, it doesn't take but a second. You can just drop these
rascals in in no time. There. And maybe, in our world, I'll take some of that
brown paint thinner. Maybe there's what remains of a little ol' fence out here. There. A few little rails on him Like so. Little bit of the liquid white. Put the indication of a little snow right up on top of those. And there's a little on
the top of the fence. Little snow's laying up there resting. Taking life easy. Take our knife with a
little bit of that white, put a little snow right
around his foots here. There. Just a little. There. Maybe it's piled up right in there. Okay. Shoot. We've done pretty good there. Tell you what. Let's put a
big tree on the other side. You know me. You know me. I always
like 'em big ol' trees. And he lives in our world right there. That's your bravery test. Right there. Right there. Just drop him in. We'll put some bushes and some weeds and all that stuff
around his little foots. I'll just use the top corner
of the ol' two-inch brush. Just tap in a few little things. Maybe right on out like
that. I don't know. There. Just tap them in. Maybe there's a baby
tree lives there, too. Little baby tree. Right in there. See, when you're doing these things, just sort of look at them. Make up your mind, drop them in. Maybe there's some little sticks and twigs and good things like that. Wherever. As I mentioned, this is the
last show of the 24th series. I really hope you've enjoyed this series. And I also mentioned in
one of the earlier series, we're thinking about
putting together a series because so many people
have wrote and said, "I haven't got to see all the shows and there's over 300 shows. How can I see 'em?" Et cetera. Et cetera. We're putting together a series now we're going to call The
Best of the Joy of Painting. I've went through and picked
out my favorite paintings from the last couple of hundred shows. And we're going to put
those together at random, and create a whole new series called The Best of the Joy of
Painting so you can see the painting series from the
time it started 'til today. If you'd like to see that,
give your station a call. Tell them you're interested in it. I'm gonna take a little brown and white, just barely touch this. Give it a little sideward pull. There. And as we get close to the
end of this ol' series, there's so many people I'd love to thank for making all this possible. There isn't time to thank everybody. But there's so many special people, and I'd like to mention just a couple. Our partners, Walt and Annette Kowalski. Annette writes all of our
books and puts them together. She's a fantastic artist in her own right. And my wife Jane. A super, super lady that has believed in me for the last 24 series and she's helped make all this possible. Jane, thank you very
much for all you've done. I'm gonna take some
brown, some paint thinner. Mix it together in the liner brush. Let's go up here and
put some limbs on here. And the people here at the station here at WIPB in good ol' Muncie, Indiana. They're one of the finest group of people I have ever known. I talk about the mean, ol' director, but she's not really all that mean. Well, maybe she is. But, very nice lady. And she's made all this possible. Her talents are in every show. And there's a couple of
people here that have been here since the very beginning. Richard Collins, Jerry Morton. They've been with us. And I'd like to publicly thank all of you for a fantastic, fantastic job. And maybe most important,
they've become my friends. There. Just put all kinds
of little limbs here. There we go. And I wish there was
time to tell everybody thank you personally, but there's not. But you know who you are,
and you know that I care. There we go. Tell you what, let's get
crazy here. Find my brush. Go right up in here and put a little snow right underneath that. And it doesn't matter if it
picks up a little of that. It makes it look like little shadows. And maybe, maybe there's even a little remaining part of a fence right there that was there one day. Still a couple ol' things across there. Put a little highlight on him. Just a touch, like so. And with that, put a
little snow under him. I think we have a finished
painting, and a finished series. And from all of us here, I'd love to wish you happy painting. I look forward to seeing you again. Take care my friend, and God bless. (light lounge music)
