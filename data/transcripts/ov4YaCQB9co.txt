hey welcome back I'm glad to see you again today today I thought we'd do a little animated opening the little painting that you see just sort of pop pop pop and appear at the beginning of each show and I'll show you how that painting was done so let's start out and have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and they'll come across as usual in the same orders I have them on the palette so we have an 18 by 24 canvas up here it's already been coated with a thin even coat of the liquid white it's all wet and ready to go so let's do the same thing let's start off today with the old two-inch brush and I'm going to go into the least least little touch of alizarin crimson just tap a tiny bit onto the brush and that little animated picture has a very soft sky it almost you almost don't see it so use very little color let's go right up in here and now I'm just going to lay at least little touch this crimson and just begin working some little areas like yes now we're going to put a darker color in between so if your crimson gets a little big it doesn't matter because it's a very easy color to cover up and we'll just cover up whatever we don't want we don't make mistakes remember that we just have happy accidents I just let this come right and down like so wherever wherever just make a decision to drop it in now we're going to have snow down here so what we have this crimson on the brush we can just put a little bit down here and there that'll end up being shadows and little bright spots on the snow UK matter without cleaning the brush I'm gonna go into a touch just a touch of the midnight black and they had least a little amount least little amount of a little blue tiniest little bit okay there's a very little paint on the brush very little see if when you do this if you have too much color just take and wipe your brush on a paper towel or something just you just want the least little hint of color this is a very soft sky very gentle almost none descript you don't even notice it in the painting barely and that's mixing with a liquid white and automatically you get those soft falinda pages we can throw a little let down here we don't care this is just a good place to clean the brush off whatever and it lets wash the brush odorless paint dinner shake it off give it a good shake beat the devil out it alright let's go back up here and begin just blending all this together just sort of follow the angles that you have in the sky let's talk a minute about canvases I get a lot of questions about canvases the canvas that we use is double primed pre-stretched it has two coats of acrylic gesso on it and it's important that you use two coats because it seals better in the liquid white will stay wet for extended periods of time if you use a canvas it only has one coat of gesso on it or canvas board will absorb your liquid white and in a matter of minutes you're working on a dry canvas and you're an agony city and then you're going to yell at me the other thing I use a canvas that has it has a great primer on it so that way when you put the liquid white on you can tell exactly where you've got it oh and what's covered and what's not covered the other thing a lot of people ask me you get with some canvas as you get a a little little wooden pegs or the plastic Gordon what brand of canvas you buy and they say what are those those are called keys and there's little slots in the back and you put the keys in the slots take a hammer and tap it and it stretches a canvas how it makes it good and tight now normally what I do to make a canvas good and tight is just take a little bit of water and put on the back and as the water dries up it'll bring that canvas tight as a drum and I like a nice tight canvas okay enough talk about canvases here is little blue and black I'm going to make a little foothill back here so decide where he lives and just barely touching and pulling down with a corner of the brush lay in a basic little foot heel shape this is far away so it's very light in value very light in color there we go just like so and it's softer down at the bottom than it is at the top see down here is very soft okay a little more the color and we have another little footy Hill and on this one I make it a little bit darker just a little bit so it stands out and you could see a variation as they get closer to you to get a little darker you know when I takes us a couple of minutes to do the little painting that you see at the beginning of the show but it takes some fantastic people a lot of time to animate it they do it one frame at a time make out a little rascal jump out we paint a picture in whole 3040 minutes and they spend six or eight hours on it to get it to get it to look like that really do some nice work okay I'm going to take a clean brush and I want to create mist when it mist here so I tap that is tap it and then I'm going to lift upward just up bring like that okay let's do another one same color just black with a touch of phthalo blue black and blue maybe this one lives there is right along here and in your world you put as many or as few of these little foothills as you want just whatever you want see there but they're that easy to do these are far away so they should have very little detail that I'm what tap the bottom of that and it's just gently lift it all up then we got us a little Foothill now that back in here looks like a little a little lake or something that's frozen we back in this I'll just use the two inch Brescia titanium white decide decide where you want it to be and just put in a little bit of color just wherever you want this is just straight titanium white yeah then come across look at there and maybe it's a little bit of their it is a little touch of gray hearing just some little shadows sometimes it's neat to take the knife and just do that now take that pull it blend it see say nice and soft buddy is there we go okay yeah right back into the white and I'm going to take to that add a little blue little phthalo blue a little stay little blue and reach up in here and grab some alizarin crimson so I'm making sort of a lavender color on the brush famous quip here now I think there's a little hill right here just pull it down make the basic shape tell you what that's not quite dark enough it didn't show up enough I want you to be able to see it better so we'll just mix it a little darker and do it again how you can see it there we are all we doing here now is just laying on a face cover and left a little hill I like to do these little snow pictures I lived in Alaska for a dozen years or so and God was having a good day when he made Alaska beautiful beautiful country so pretty all right let me grab an old fan brush let's go right in to dark sienna Van Dyke Brown and I'm just gonna mix some of these colors on the brush okay let's go ahead up here now maybe there's some old dead weeds and stuff and live right along here touch push been that brushed upward see can you see that let me get way back here so you can see bend it upward like that that's it okay let it just wander right open to nothing and maybe it comes down the hill and some places just wherever you want it just sort of look at it and let it go glad I got this won't be an exact duplicate of what you see at the beginning cuz it can never go back and do that'll show you how it was made maybe there's some big ones right there look at there just turn the brush all the way and pop all kinds a little happy things there okay I have several fan brushes going so I don't have to clean them now let's take white we'll use at least little touch of the bright red in it white least little touch a bright red now you can go back in here and begin forming all these little things and if you pick up a little that Brown don't worry about it makes it look like shadows in there see how you can just add all these little things if you're doing seascapes this is also a super way to make little sand dunes look at that I'm going to get that now then let's do some liner brush work I'm going to take paint thinner paint thinner on the liner brush I want my paint to be like water it's very thin consistency of ink turn that brush twisted and bring it to a beautiful sharp point there you are okay let's go up here now there's little trees back in here now this paint is very thin it'll flow if it doesn't flow for you add a little more thinner all right and you can put as many or as few of these little trees these little trees lost their leaves for the winter as many or as few as you want and at home you don't have the clock ticking away so you can put hundreds and hundreds of little limbs on here if you want to really add some detail to it here if I go over 30 minutes they yell at scream and we have no sense of humor at all don't understand it there I'm just kidding out work with the best crew in television okay maybe I think there was a bigger one that lived mmm right there give him a little arm there's another one right there wherever wherever there we go just many little helms as you want keep the paint very thin so it literally just flows that off the brush some people will find it easier to pull out some will find it easier to go down try both ways whichever works the best for you then that's the right way to do it look at all the little things you can make here see they're just pop them in little sticks and twigs just to hundreds of them that gives you the indication of all kinds of little things in there a little more the paint thinner and I think there's a little fence right here doop doop doop doop when it comes right on over the hill there it goes what's a little stick something in that cute see there make a happy little fence that easy that just goes right on over the hill we don't know where he goes don't care add it let's come back in here let's load a little white on this brush just really just really fill it up three Chilean grab a little that bluish color okay now right along in here just lay a little bit off don't cover everything let some of it but some of that pinkish color show through we put on but we're changing the angle so it flattens this there we go all right okay Oh yet we got that almost finished on that side let's go back into some of our light lavender color house the lizard crimson they look blue and white crimson blue and white Jane back here happy little Hill he comes right down there's a blue put a bump Jeep let him come right down in there hey should I tell you what probably get that going we'll just bring this right on down just lay in some of these little colors here and there Oh kinds of little things what hmm okay then we'll take our fan brush it has the dark sienna and the Van Dyck Brown on it let's go right up here and then we're just going to pop in some more little bushes just push and upward just bend it upward let them there we go let's let them come right on down my cat and this is the way you create the lay of the land just like so just like so now we can take our white little bright red in it come back in here see their Creed all kinds of beautiful little things you can do it no you could new you can do it see they're here it is very softly Linda's just the way you want it just like so and then back to my liner brush the very thin paint this is dark sienna and Van Dyck Brown very thin though very very thick and let's just put a happy little tree right there just letting go wherever wherever there put a few little twigs and sticks and Leyla's those are fun those are fun now maybe there's one a little closer to you see we put his little foot in the front let it go right across this one and in your world you decide where the trees live put them in there they go just all kinds of little twigs just like so and maybe back here maybe there's some more little fence things we can just have all admit you want wherever a few little sticks and stuff that are growing up in here see there yeah they are okay now I'm going back to my fan brush with the Browns on it same old fan brush I think maybe there it is let's just make a decision just make a decision here's an here's another happy little plane see their head pushes that one back they sort of let it flow this really creates the illusion of the land wherever you want it to go see there we've just change this angle and make it sort of rounds here's what it looks like Hills this is a place you bring you you bring you slid you liz'll right down in there my luck I'd run into the tree over here hurt my head okay back to the liner brush and we can just pop in some little sticks and twigs in this plane all kinds of little things that are happening okay it's maybe right here maybe there's a big big old post right here just a couple of pokes left this old fence it's just about fell down got one board going across tell you what maybe there's some soup that sort of looks neat have some little stuff hanging on there you go through a little touch of white soup put a little soup gotta make him funny noises or nothing works that easy my fan burst it has the white with a little touch of the bright red on it now we can go back create all a little white areas in here the little highlights the good things happy little thanks there they are there they are here comes one right now I'm doing it's just just laying on some paint but we don't want to cover everything that some of these shadows shoot through you get carried away and cover it all up and back to the white canvas you started with now very lightly very lightly very lightly just barely grazing the canvas now you can blend all this together this is a bristle fan brush and very thick paint so you need a brush should sketch them got something to it little soft brush won't move this thick paint like this see how you can smooth all that together that easy okay and I think in the in the one at the beginning of show there's a big strong almighty tree that lives right here so let's do him I don't take some Van Dyke Brown pull him out cut off a little bit they had to make a decision where does he live and our world he lives right there there and there and there and wherever you wanting to go need a strong base frame to stand on this is a big tree excuse my arm there let me come over this side I'm just putting right in like so see how easy it is to make a big strong tree let's go right in here maybe maybe yeah there it is there's another arm it comes right out see you can take a straight knife and make a curving limb I knew you could do that there and I like trees that have character I get tired of trees that look like their future telephone poles I like trees that have some character to them well they get Gnarls and bins and oh look at here comes her mmm I tell you this this trees had a rough life he got he got hurt when he was little I can tell well you don't you know get looking this bad overnight terrible tree yeah actor oh liner brush I'm gonna take go into some white a little bit of a little touch of the dark sienna paint thinner white dark see Aniyah with that just very quickly just sort of jerk that ran down there just pull it so it skips and causes all rough looking things to happen just pull it real fast see there so you get all those old marquee looking things that's what my dog doesn't old Marquis things okay back to paint thinner and brown and now then let's begin putting in all kinds of limbs and give this thing some character a lot of thinner lot of thinner like so we can just go anywhere we want to go with these I think that wherever ooh there's a nice one nice one there's one there and just gobs and gobs and gobs of them there there's some over in here wherever you want to just sort of look at them make a decision this is where the birds all sit in the wintertime they got to have a place to sit and be happy hey they're right on up like so these little limbs are a lot of fun to make a lot of fun but they're very time-consuming to make a lot of them so just take your time enjoy it you big glass of iced tea and really have some fun and the more of you have in here the more realistic it looks didn't it need all kinds of old things happen there okay let's go let's go back to my fan brush it has the brown on it and I'm going to take and make a little flicks for this tree to stand on he's got to have a big strong foot out here maybe maybe there's a little there it is little thing like that a little thing like it let me find my brush it has the there the white a little bit of a little touch of the bright red and will go right in here and grab that bring all this together see if you pick up a little that Brown don't fight it it makes beautiful little shadows in the snow so we're very pretty look at there see and grab a little bit of that pull it just let it go and with our liner brush we take a little touch of the brown listen pop a few more little sticks and twigs here and there like so all kinds of little things jazz like that and you can you can have as many or as few as you want in your world tell you what we just about having finished painting I'm gonna take a little bit of the bright red will sign this one right here this is a lot of fun I think you'll enjoy this painting it'll teach you a lot I tell you what you know I've talked in several of his shows about my little friend the little bird I showed him earlier I had so many people asked me if I'd show him again so we have a minute or so left here so let me let me bring him over here show you how he's doing look at here this is this is the little mocking air a little Robin can you see in there looky here look at that ain't he cute see if you look see and I always talk about the birds have to have a place to sit this little bird was orphaned and he lives with me now and I feed him every day and take care of him and pretty soon he's going to be a big bird he's going to learn to fly and we're going to turn him loose and send him back to nature so if you see little creatures around your house help take care of them because they're god's little creatures and they're fantastic get to know him make friends with him this one the lone took me by the bird lady here in Muncie who are a film and he's a loner bird so when I called him peep because he peeps all the time always hungry look at that he'll eat my finger old clock on the wall tells me we have to go so from all of us here and my little friend I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and we'll see you next time
