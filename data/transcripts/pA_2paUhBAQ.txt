(happy music) - Hi welcome back, certainly
glad you could join us today. I thought today we'd
just do a little seascape that I think you're gonna enjoy. Let's start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us and while they're doing that let me show you what I've got done Today I have a smaller canvas than usual because I wanted one that's rectangular and quite long so I have a
12 inch by 24 inch canvas you use any size that you'd like I just sorta like this for seascapes. And I've covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of liquid white and liquid clear mixed together just a little of each,
about half and half, and I've just covered it but once again a very thin coat. So let's just start out and have some fun. Let's start with a little two inch brush and go into a small
amount of the pthalo blue just tap a little into the bristles. Notice we pull the paint out very flat so we can just pick up a little bit of it, you go up here into this big pile you gonna get too much, just a little, we just want a little and we tap it into the bristles that helps assure a even nice distribution of color all the way through it, okay
let's go up in here. Now then, just making little x's little crisscross strokes, let's just put in a happy little sky,
just something like so. All the way across, there. About like that, it doesn't much matter wherever you want it that's exactly where it should be. So we'll come down to
about there, alright. And, that's about enough, right there. Okay, and then we get to
wash the brush, already. As you know that's my favorite part of the whole painting procedure, is just washing the brush,
and you shake it off. (laughs) We just create one big mess,
that's fun, it really is. I'm gonna go right into titanium white, I'm just tapping the brush right into just straight titanium white. I'll put the indication here, some little floater clouds that just live here. Isn't life wonderful, there we go. We have such a good time
making these shows here. We've been making television here at the same studio now
for well over 10 years and these people have become very special friends to me,
it's like coming home. There we are, something about like that. And then we'll just sorta
fluff 'em up a little bit. and go across and that'll give us a little cloud way back in the distance. And, hey man, let me find my knife, we'll take a little alizarin crimson a little pthalo blue, mix it together I want to make a lavender color but sorta to the reddish
side, there we are. Okay wipe off the old knife and shoot that brush isn't too dirty maybe we can continue to use it and I'll just go right over that color and maybe we have some indications of some little, little lavender clouds that are right at the water line and we can just throw in
some happy little things. Wherever you wan them, wherever, wherever, it doesn't matter,
something about like that There, we just let them
maybe just float right on out to nothing over there, oop, there's a big one that happens sometimes. There we go and right on out. Then we'll fluff it, lift
it, blend it, like that and that'll give us the indication of some little clouds
that live far, far away. And that's all we're
looking for right now, just indications, there,
alright, that simple. Isn't that a fantastic
way of making a very colorful little sky that's effective. Alright, we get to wash the brush again. Shake off that paint thinner
(laughs) Just cover everybody in the studio. Alright, you can blend that
a little if you want to, but we're not gonna spend much time on the sky I want to work
more on the water today. Let's take, we'll go right
into some pthalo blue i like pthalo blue, a little bit of black, just mix them together and be right back I'm gonna get a little crimson, so we have pthalo blue,
black, and crimson. There and let's figure out basically here maybe, let's see where we want our water line to be, I know that's probably not real straight, there. When you're painting it's better to sort of step back and take a look see sometimes when you're standing as close as I am here it's very hard to tell if a line is straight,
crooked, or in between, but let's say that's
halfway straight, there. Now, I added a little more crimson right here on the edges, I want a little more crimson right there, something about like that maybe on both sides. In your world you decide, now, you're probably wondering why I put the liquid clear with the liquid white because when I did this I didn't want it to turn light blue, I wanted it to stay quite dark and if I had put liquid white only on there, as you know, it would have got much lighter in value and I don't want that. I want it to stay quite
dark, it makes it easier. There, alright, and we'll just bring that down to somewhere in there it doesn't matter, you make the big decisions where all these things live in your world, there we go. Okay, let me just grab another brush so I don't have to waste all my time just cleaning and I'm gonna pick up some of that lavender
color that we made, that was alizarin crimson
and a little bit of the pthalo blue mixed together, maybe right in here, ooh isn't that a pretty color. We'll just add a little bit of that. Thought we'd just do a little seascape today that's very colorful and I have a confession to make, people are always asking me where do you get ideas for your paintings and I was over in Lucerna Beach the other day that my partner and that shop, she's got a little shop over there and she was teaching this painting to some of her students and I just fell in love with it and I asked her for permission to show
it to you on the program. So Annette, thanks, I owe you one. There we go and I probably won't do near as good a job on it as she does but this is basically the way she does it So we'll try it, wash the brush again. If nothing else we'll get a lot of practice washing the brush, okay. We're ready, let's find, oh we'll just use a little fan brush it doesn't matter. One of the things I like to do when I do seascapes is figure out where my major wave is gonna be and then just take, you can use a Filbert, it doesn't matter, fan brush whatever and I just want to basically indicate in here where I think the
major wave is gonna live and in my world I think it's gonna go right out through
here and maybe crash over right there, maybe it'll
just disappear, how's that? Nice simple little painting, there we are. Okay, now, back into my white, still using the same little fan brush and maybe back in here, going straight in and just giving it a wiggle, maybe there's a little splasher that lives back here in
the background somewhere, straight in and just make
it wiggle up and down. And that's all there is to it. Something about like that. And we can put the
indication here and there and there and here, just some little doers that live back here far away. There we are, a little more of the white. Strengthen that one a little, yeah, it's a little closer, right, okay, something about like so. Annette does a lot of gorgeous paintings I think her most fantastic thing is flowers, she does some of the most gorgeous flowers I've ever seen. I'm gonna get her on the show here one day sooner or later and get her to paint a flower for you. I think you'll be amazed, I'm not a very good flower painter but she is dynamite, dynamite,
we'll talk her into it. I'm gonna take a little yellow
ochre and a little white, a little yellow ochre
and white, like that. Just make me a nice little,
sort of a gold color and let's go up in here, this is going to be our little wave, let's put a little, a little bit of that color right in here. Like so, something like that, now, we'll get a little blender brush, and just begin blending that,
blend it, blend it, blend it. Now you can do this several times to achieve a desired
likeness if you want to, up to you, you decide, you decide, where ever you want it but see that blender brush just makes it soft as silk. Just so tender, so soft, there we go, something about like that, okay. Now if you wanted to
make it a little brighter we'll just do it, let
me just pick a little of that same color, same color, and maybe right in here we'll
have it a little brighter. And just sort of smoosh
it in as Steve says. I don't know if that's a word or not but he uses it, everybody
knows what he means. Three we go, something about like that. Alright, and begin
thinking about shape here. Okay, now then, let's take, I have several little fan, I'm using number three fan brushes today but it doesn't matter you can use three or
six, whatever you have. Take a little dark color, this is just some black and some blue,
a little crimson in it and let's take and I wanna make this wave sort of crash over right here. Now the only way to make that dark right there stand out, we're gonna put a little light right behind it. And I want to lay that in first, get an idea where it's at, go back to my fan brush that has some of the lighter color in it and
let's come right behind it, and then gently blend that back thinking about how the wave goes up. Just need a little light area in there to make that rascal show up. See here it come, here it comes, watch. This is one of the nicest little seascapes and it works very well, very well. There, now then. Okay I'll show you a little trick here. Take a little bit of
dark color on the filbert about like so, and we go up in here, and see this little wave right here, this little crasher, we
push right up into there and just form it, that easy, that easy, isn't it neat? That's a little trick Annette showed me and it works very well, see now, it just makes a nice dark bottom and it works that easy,
same thing over in here. Put a little dark right in there, then we'll come back
and put a little light and some foam on there and
that will show up so nice. So nice and we can put our foam in I'll tell you what, we can
just use a little filbert or you can use a fan
brush it doesn't matter, I picked up a filbert so we'll use it. And let's go in here and think about some happy little splashes living right up here on top of this like so, now I picked up some blue and I'm gonna let that be the shadow as we come up in here. Okay now wipe off the brush, pick up a little bit of clean white, and we can highlight that, just think about water crashing, and smashing and having
a good time up in here. There, alright. i like to paint water, don't do it a lot, but I do like to paint it, I was born in Daytona Beach Florida, which is one of the most
fantastic beaches in the world. Now then let's take our little script liner brush, take
a little light blue, we'll use a little white, paint thinner, got a little bit of color on the brush and we can go up in here and we can being putting all kinds of little doers that live up in here,
just begin applying them. Let these little foam patterns
just work their way on out wherever you want them to go right up on top of that wave, okay a little more of the dark color I want to put a little
dark edge right there, just so it will make that stand right out, let that little rascal crash over, some little things coming through there, just take your time and play
with these they're a lot of fun you can really just move
the water every which way. Okay, let's take the little knife, this is the small knife,
I've got some white, it's got a small, small amount of blue, just enough to tint it, cut
off a little roll of paint and swoop in here and maybe right in here, and we're gonna use a lot of pressure get in here and just (grunts) maybe there's a , see there, really applying a lot of pressure though, there it goes back somewhere,
we don't know where it goes. We want to take our little fan brush, it's pretty clean, it
doesn't have much on it, and I wanna grab that and pull it back back, back, back see, and that creates that illusion right there, that easy. Something about like so. That works well let's do
another one what the heck. In our world there lives another little thing right in there, here it comes here it comes, there, see. Just put it wherever you want it. Grab our little fan brush again, and once again all you do is just go back with it, just pull it backwards. And that creates all those little things that you want
in there, very simply. Very simple, you don't have to work at it hardly at all. And as you know, I'm a very lazy painter I look for easy ways to do things. Let me get back into my liner brush with a little bit of paint that's been thinned
with paint thinner. And we'll just put the indication here and there of just
some little foam patterns. Something about like that, we're not too worried about it at this point. We'll make a little highlight right up on top of that so it continues on there. Maybe back in here you could just highlight a few of these little rascals. Not gonna worry too much about them but just show some of them, think about being down at the ocean watching waves come in,
that's what makes it pretty. Tell you what, find a, here's a filbert, let's go in to, let's have a rock, we use some van dyke brown, some dark sienna just mixed together, and maybe in our world
there lives right here klump just drop it in, big old stone lives right there, right about here. We put some dark color in first just to make the base of it and then we'll come back and put a little highlight on it here and there and there and here, wherever you want it. Pull a little of that
color down, just a little and we will take a two inch
brush grab it, pull down. something like so, and go across, that will end up being a little reflection in the water
when we get it all finished. Okay let's take some white paint and we'll get some bright red, bright red, I'm using the same old dirty filbert I don't care, it doesn't matter, a little touch of the
bright red, not much, and now let's just sort
of highlight our stone, just let a little color play through here. There we go, see there? Just sort of play them back and forth dark and light and you can actually sculpt the stone doing that, there. Think about where all these
little things would live, that easy, you can make it right in there. Something like so, and then go back to our small knife with a
little bit of the white on it, and let's just put a little indication, little water floating
right around the bottom. And maybe, I got it, wait, I know, I know, watch, right here, right
here, here it comes, here's another little thing
that lives right out here. Maybe it comes right on over
there somewhere, who knows. Once again we grab our fan brush and we just pull that back, that simple. Just pull it back, like so. And we've got all kinds of water here, we can take a filbert brush and take a little bit of that blue
and black and crimson color, and we just go back up in here and punch a few little holes in the surf, just a few little indications, some little dark areas makes it pretty, see that, there they are, just a few, that's easier than trying to paint all the foam, just to go
in there and drop some in. Okay, lost my brush here for a second, got so many brushes going I lost one, we'll take a little bit of light blue, thin it down and I want to put the indication here of maybe just, just a little ripple on the surface, a little wet sheen, there we go, something about like that just
to give a little indication. Alright let's have some fun, I'm gonna grab a fan brush, we're gonna take, a little bit of white, I know, lost it this time, I think maybe we'll have us a little sand dune lives right out here (whistles) maybe it comes down, I don't know, where ever you want it, but allow it to pick up some of those
colors that are underneath. There we go, just a
happy little sand dune. He just stays out here and watches the water all day, has
a good time, great time. Grab another fan brush,
take some sap green, a little bit of the brown color, I'm just going to mix some colors together on my brush here, sap green, some of the browns, let's go up in here
and let's just punch in the bottom, it's gonna be the bottom of, I need a little more
color, of some little weeds that live right in here, there we go. Always got these little
things that live there. Maybe a few little doers
in here, down here, I don't know just, all we're doing is pushing in some color here. We'll go back and get out liner brush, put some paint thinner on it, and we're gonna begin taking, we can start with a little
bit of the green and brown, and I just want to lift these up, make some little sea oats out here. You just pull that color
right on out of there, we'll do some dark color first, we're using green and brown here, just pull them out, alright, a little more paint thinner, if your paint won't float add more paint thinner to it. There we go, and we'll
do a little on this one, and the next one, whatever, take your brush and you can literally grab a little bit of that base color and let it become the shadows, just let it mix right
in there, it's alright, that'll become your shadows,
that green and brown makes nice little shadows, there. Don't want to kill all those nice colors you picked up from underneath, they become your good friend, put all these little rascals in. I'm gonna go in now to yellow ochre, and just pop some right
over the top of it. Now when you're at home and you have unlimited time you can really play with these and put all
kinds of gorgeous things. Here if I go over 30 minutes I got a mean old director, she has
no sense of humor at all. That's okay, we'll just put
something in here real quick. And sometimes there are little things out here on the end, it's up to you. Now no little seascape would be complete without a happy little palm tree so we'll just use the fan brush go into some van dyke
brown, a little black, just have a little dark
color to make his trunk, and he lives in our world,
he lives right there, let's put a little crook
down at the bottom. Old palm trees have a tendency to sort of get bent on the end there, something about like that. Now dip the brush into a little bit of paint thinner, still
using brown and black, I wanna thin the paint just a little, not a lot, just a little, and let's put in just
some basic ideas here of some little leaves on this palm tree, there they go, wherever, wherever, maybe there's one down here, I want to have ones
coming right toward me, so we'll just sort of hang
him out there like that, there's one behind him,
there's a nice little one, take a little bit of brown, white, just want to touch this
edge just a little, then we'll take a fan brush and grab that and pull it around so it'll, makes the trunk look round. Take a little touch of yellow and green mixed together and let's just take and highlight these just a
little, just a little, there, here we go,
something about like that. Shoot with that we about
got a little old palm tree but I wanted that limb to look like it comes right straight out towards me. You can use a liner brush,
make a lot more detail, I think with that we'll call
this little painting finished. I hope you enjoyed it and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and god bless my friend. (happy music)
