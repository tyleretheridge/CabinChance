I'm glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic painting with me could in the last series we took a canvas and we put some contact paper around it and cut an oval in it and we made a fantastic little painting and we have such a positive response about it I thought we'd do another one today so tell you what let's haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and they'll come across as usual in the same orders I have on the palette starting with the titanium white and working around while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started as I say I've covered this with contact paper around the edges and this is just ordinary contact papers you can pick up at your local hardware store or grocery store whatever just cut an oval in it stick it on the canvas then I put liquid white in the in the center here as usual and we're ready so we'll take a 2 inch brush and I'm gonna go right into a little bit of a lizard and crimson and all we want is just a very small amount so tap the brush into just a little tiny bit of the color a little bit okay let's go right up here now then right in here just making little little crisscross strokes I'm gonna lay in a little touch of that just let it work for a head up like it see there now then I'll take a little touch of phthalo blue on the brush and mix it right into that crimson so it makes a beautiful little lavender color there we are just tap the brush okay back up here and it will just lay in a little bit of that mmm beautiful colors with a little winter scene today I'd like to do little little winter scene since I lived in Alaska so long they're they're sort of special to me there we go so now we have sort of lavender on each side and a little bit of pink right in there I'm going to take a touch of that crimson color and we'll have some water in this painting so I'll just lay a little bit right in here there that's pretty already very soft colors make you happy when you finished with it okay let me wash the old brush here we'll scrub it against the screen this in the bottom of the can to shake it off mm-hmm and then just have a good time with it all right now I want to take this clean dry brush and just blend this together very softly still use a little crisscross strokes just blend it together okay now then same old brush and I haven't cleaned it same old dirty brush I'm going right into midnight black and I'm going to tap some of that right in there you don't have to clean the brush because the black is so strong it'll just eat up whatever is on there all right let's go up here now I want some big clouds that are coming across here so just use a brush sort of side words just sort of come like it will just make all kind of happy little things see there okay a little more of the black maybe there's a nice big thing it lives yep pray it out through there wherever wherever just sort of let them play and have fun there's one I see one right here just pull that right on down there we go it's a super super easy little way to make a very effective sky very quickly now all I have the black on the brush well put a little bit down here in the water just pulling from the outside in right across there we go good ok I know that take a clean brush and I'm gonna very gently bring all this together this will soften all the edges and here go all the way across that's all there is to it we have a happy little sky they are there let's build us a mountain today tell you what let's take black oh it takes midnight black a little bit of the phthalo blue we'll throw a little crimson in there too a little lizard crimson so we have black crimson and the blue pull it out very flat go across and cut off a little roll of paint there here you can see it tanks go right up in here Alan decide where your mountain lives our mountain is gonna live right there using very firm pressure very firm pressure just push that son-of-a-gun right into the fabric okay there we are and that easy we have a happy little mountain shape and the only thing that you're worried about at this point is this nice top hedge you could care less what's happening down here that doesn't matter only thing you worried about the edge there Kenny now with the 2 inch brush grab this and pull it cause a canvas is wet you can move the paint look at that that easy and easy you can move the mountain and it fantastic to have that much power now then let's put some snow on that mountain we'll go right into the titanium white and I'm going to pull it out just as flat as I can and to that I'm going to add the least little touch of the bright red least little touch pull it out very flat get strong with it straight down cut across and get that little roll of paint let's do that again so you can see it pull it out very flat cut across see that that's what you're looking for right there okay now then just take the knife no pressure touch it just let it slide right along the mountain see how easy that is no pressure no pressure there we go one thing I should mention when you look at the knife close-up you'll notice that it's black without we paint the knife black on TV so it doesn't shine but my knife is like yours it's just painted when they're new it looks just like her own beautiful but if I use that on television director kill me when that started shining there we go we'll put a little touch of highlight right back there now then for the shadow color we'll take some blue some they look blue why I'm going to add a little black to that to dull it down pull that out the same way very flat cut across and once again we have a small roll of paint okay now then touch no pressure and just give it a gentle pull see there and that easy you can create a fantastic little mountain there he comes right there there's another one wherever you want to just drop them in and you can go back and you could make this mountains shape change it fantastic it you can change it mountain that easy you can put a new peak on there or you can take them away whatever makes you happy okay good clean dry brush there we go and just tap we want to create mist at the bottom of this mountain follow the angles in the mountain over here go in this direction I'll always follow the angles in your Mountain then lift upward see how soft that makes the base of the mountain look looks like he's just laying out there in the mist okay and that easy we've got a happy little mountain tell you what tell you what let's put a little footy Hill in there I'm just going to take some white and go right into that same mountain color I want to lighten it up a little bit and I'm just taking the corner of the brush there you can see it and pull it in through right through the color gasps go up here and maybe the little foothill lives right there take the corner the brush touch and just give it a downward pull just down right you can just make all kinds of little things happen you have to make some big decisions though where's your foot he'll live there a lot of bumps a few bumps there I have to make those big decisions go right now then with a clean brush I want to create mist at the bottom of the foothill so we'll just have we just happened the bottom just the bottom we don't want to touch his top edge at all just the bottom very lightly lift upwards and you have a Foothill now maybe maybe in your world maybe there's another layer foothills same color only a little darker use less white see now it stands out as things get closer to you in a landscape they should get darker darker darker dark now while I have that color on the brush watch right here maybe there's gonna be some reflections in the water and they live right about there all we're doing is laying some color on the canvas then we'll take a clean brush grab and pull straight down and go across and that easy we have instant reflections a little bit of the liquid white and we'll put it out here and we'll pull it out very flat and take the knife and cut across okay let's go up here yeah we can go back in here just cut in a little water line just a little water line and act like you're trying to cut a hole right through the canvas just really get in there and cut on it you're not gonna hurt this canvas it's tough maybe there's a few little ripples here and there but even these ripples and the water line everything needs to be basically straight or you order a run right out of your painting get your floor whip and you gonna be upset with me okay listen let's bill some trees we'll take a big bunch of the midnight black we'll throw some Van Dyke Brown in it some crimson shoot with throw some blue in there too what the heck looking for a color that looks black but we want some blue in there so it has a blue base to it all right and this doesn't have to be mixed very much can let me clean the knife off here and we will grab a fan brush we'll make them with a fan brush today that's easiest way okay load the fan brush full of paint just really pull it through there like so okay look at all the painters in that brush a lot of paint okay let's go up here now you have to make another big decision where is your trees live I think it's gonna be a tree right there so just touch the canvas and give yourself sort of a little guideline and then just to corner the brush and work back and forth back and forth and as you work down the tree push harder add more pressure to the brush and those bristles watch see the bristles are bending downward see that's bending down my cat okay like you can really see that good there there we go yeah right on down maybe to about there whoever and he's got a little friend right there just like so and maybe maybe there's another one right over here we don't know just make a decision decide how many trees live in your world and drop them in Janice drop em in shoot I tell you I think there's another tree in my world and he lives over here and I like trees once in a while in paintings that are crooked mm just like politicians I got to be a crooked one there once in a huh there we go select that one band right on over there okay yeah I tell you let's take a little bit of the dark Sienna 1:8 it will make a happy little tree trunk got that low roll of pain again let's go right up here just barely touch just touch the canvas we'll pull off what he wants give you back what's left that's what my tax man says to we're gonna pull off what we won't give you back what's left of course there is nothing left there now we got little trunks in there gonna find a one-inch brush I'll go ride into a touch of the phthalo blue and into the midnight black I'll reach over here and grab some white just put it right in there and make a very dark blue very dark okay let's go out up here maybe there's some happy little Bush is a liver underneath these trees they were putting the dark in here only so the light will show when we put it on that's the only reason we're using this dark right here okay a little bit of dark underneath do you know already that's gonna end up being the reflection do you see just pull it down and go across instant reflections yeah then let's put some snow on those bushes I'm going to dip right into the liquid white and go into the titanium white add a little touch I've read to that a little touch of the bright red let me say it again little touch eat up your whole world in a second that bread is so bright pull this brush in one direction load a lot of paint into it see it has a curve because you pulled it in one direction can't go up here now with a rounded corner to the top touch and just give it a little tiny push just enough to get the paint stick there we go touch and do one bush at a time form you little bush remember he's an individual he's has a personality all of his own I'll put a little touch more of that liquid white on my brush if your paint will not stick add more of the liquid white remember our golden rule then paint will stick to a thick paint now here I fit reverse the brush and I'm tapping downward I want to make some reflections in the water ahead easy clean dry brush nice when we find out if you have a delicate touch whisper light whisper just barely caress it it didn't go across this is three hairs and some air yeah then tell you what let's do we'll take some white let's put us a little snowbank right out here all this needs a place to set so it doesn't fall over in the water make a big splash okay angles here are very important very important a little bit of the liquid white it will cut us in a little water line this puts in a water line and also cleans up the edges if you've got some little ragged edges down here this is when you clean them all up and make them pretty there we go okay now the clean point of the knife I'm just gonna scrape it a few little sticks and twigs where do you want okay now I have several fan brushes going and take a little bit of the liquid white a little phthalo blue and it will make a nice blue color here you knew that though when I went into phthalo blue okay see their brush is loaded quite well okay let's go up here now then let's put a little bit of snow on these trees don't overdo don't overdo the contrast here the dark against the light is what makes this painting so don't overdo just just enough to give the indication if there's a little snow laying on these evergreens there and as they go down let them get darker darker darker darker not as much lights gonna get down toward the bottom it's gonna be in shadow more all right I think we got a nice little thing happening over there let's go on the other side and play some now maybe there's a nice evergreen that lives over here so once again load that brush full of pate a lot of paint can't go right up here maybe this one maybe he goes we up here we don't know there we go see and he just works right I'm down back there right there cover up that beautiful mountain that you made this is a good way you know trees trees really cover a multitude of sins if you haven't a place in your painting that's not so great put a tree over that's an easy way to cover it up I said that in class one time the lady says well I'm gonna have nothing but a forest in my picture cuz I'm gonna cover up the whole thing there now then back to my one-inch brush and pick up some of that dark blue color pull it in one direction and go back up here we'll put in some happy little bushes push upward then that brush don't let it slide though if it slide you can get that and that's bad if that happens to you just cover it up with a nice little bush that easy you can fix it there we go okay now then back to my one inch bracelet has the Hawaii donut a little bit of liquid white little titanium white and the least little touch of bright red at it Lee's little touch low that brush full of paint tell you what let me hold it this way look at the end of it look at all the paint probably the biggest single mistake made is not putting enough paint into the brush there now push barely touch the canvas it's a gentle gentle little touch maybe right here there's another happy little Bush one Bush at a time there we go and working layers that's what helps create the illusion of depth okay there's one there's one I tell you what I want to know the tree so you can change your mind and have a tree that lives right here there it is I don't want this one big tree to get lonely trees are like all of us they need friends now he has a friend if if I had a beautiful little place like this I'd have to have a little cabin out there so let's do that and probably one of the easiest ways to paint a cabin is to take your knife and just scrape out the basic shape this does two things probably most important it removes that then paint the loose paint but it also allows you to lay out your not your cabin without being committed let's take a little Van Dyke Brown just do that so all you need to do little brown little dark sienna mix together and we'll put in the front there we go other side soup see how quick you can build a little cabin over here Zoop got to make those little noises or don't work a little dark CNN white and just barely touch just like you're putting snow on the mountain no that'll make it look old we will straighten that out a little bit there that's better that's better a little more of the Van Dyck Brown put a little door in there we'll go right around the edges sort of outline that door so it stands out and you can just cut through this and make it look like little planks now we need we need some roof on that guy that lives there is gonna freeze to death we don't give him a roof so come right down and put some snow right on his roof dad easy now over here on this side this kind of has to snow over there too look at that now let's have here's some snow out in front you'll have a little path and he walks right down this path and goes over here fishes for that great big trout that lives out there okay now we can take a little more of the liquid white titanium white touch of the bright red and we can put some bushes around his little cabin there they come look there and that easy you've got a little cabin a little walkway okay happy little snow picture it's nice and cold but yet is still warm now then tell you what let's have some fun as I mentioned at the beginning of the show we have contact paper up here so let's take it off maybe we can come right down in here and watch I'm gonna grab this come right up here watch watch what happens just pull that red off and look at there there we go in that need of course we run our tree over here so watch here we'll go right back into the dark color unless let's just give his tree a shot of vitamins saying we come right back I like to to do these ovals and allow part of the painting to project out of the oval just like so see there's our tree we gave him some vitamins and he grew right back and he had a friend here right so we don't want him to be left out and that easy you can go right back in there and put his friend back in and it's sort of like a vignette but not not exactly like it it's a little different and it creates a very nice mood and if you interested in it and that happy buck the ease will certainly sell people like these paintings now take a little the dark sienna and white mixture and we'll put a happy little tree trunk in here now you might notice these edges are blue that was a little sneaky huh I had painted the canvas blue in advance and the liquid white is so opaque if there's some blue in here it'll go right over it you don't have to worry about it it'll cover it right up and then when you pull your contact paper off there it is all around the edges and it really gives you gives you a nice painting but try it with other colors and you can make all kinds of things happen on the edges here and you can put different colors that you can fade paint in I could get carried away you could do so many things with this so many things I'm getting letters from people all over the country and they they just say all kinds of beautiful things are happening try it you'll see what it can do lucky they're just this little bit of the phthalo blue and white just to put a little LED on there look at there not too much just sort of touch there we go like that see and as it gets down here darker darker darker darker darker okay yeah we can take the knife and evergreens always have sold dead layups just grab it and so you take the point of the knife give it a little pull see making little dead limbs hanging let's do a couple on the other side over here too don't want them left out and I think you just about have a have a completed painting so let's sign this one now just take my liner brush dip it right into some liquid clear and go right into the bright red now you you want to make this color very thin almost like water okay let's go right up here maybe I'll sign this one right here like so I hope you've enjoyed this painting give these ovals and different shapes a try use the contact paper you won't believe the things you can make until next time from all of us here happy painting god bless you
