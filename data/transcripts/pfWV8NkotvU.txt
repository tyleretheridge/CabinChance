(gentle music) - Hi, welcome back. I'm glad you could join us today. Today I have a special
little friend here with us that I'd like to share with
you before we get started. This is a little kestrel, and it's one of the most
beautiful little birds that you've ever seen. And he's also known as a sparrow hawk. And he's with us today. I've borrowed him from the
bird lady here in Muncie. And I think he's one of the
most gorgeous little birds, and his name is Falkey. And he was raised by a
young man here in Muncie. And look at that. Isn't he something? This is one of the most
gorgeous little characters. I hope you enjoy seeing him. Falkey, I gotta go to work. So I'm gonna... I'll tell you what. We're gonna have all the
colors ran across the screen that everybody needs to
paint along with us today. And while they're doing that, I'm gonna show everybody what
we've done on this canvas. Okay? Good. Come right up here. Let me show you what I've got going. Today we've got our standard
old pre-stretched canvas. And I've taken a little
bit of black gesso here and just covered this with using a sponge and the black gesso and
just covered this area. Let that dry completely,
and then we've taken a little bit of Midnight
Black, Dark Sienna, and a touch of Prussian Blue. And I've just covered
this whole thing here. In the white area, we've put just a tiny bit of Liquid White. So with that, we're about ready. I hope you liked seeing
that little kestrel. That's one of the prettiest little devils. There, let's take a
little of the same colors. We'll use Midnight Black, a little Prussian Blue
and some Dark Sienna. There, and let's just go up in here, and let's just begin playing a little. We'll let that color
come right on out here and just sort of dance it around. I thought today we'd do a scene like maybe you're deep in the woods. Deep in the woods. So we have all of these little shapes and stuff in the background. I don't want to blend it too much today. I want to leave all of these
irregular patterns in there. There, so it'll look,
hopefully when we're all done, it'll look like maybe
there's light shining through undergrowth that's far away. Something about like that. A little more of the color. We'll put a little something in here, too. What the heck. And just let it blend
back into this dark area. Now the reason I use this black gesso is because any time I'm
gonna have a lot of area that's gonna be dark in a painting, and I know that in advance, if you use the black gesso, it saves you a tremendous amount of work. And a little of these
patterns will show through, and it looks like things that you've spent months working on. And it's our secret. It's our secret. Okay. That's about all we
need for back in there. I'll tell you what. Today, let's have some fun
with our little oval brush. And then we'll go basically
into those same colors. Maybe I'll add a little
Van Dyke brown to it. I'm gonna darken it a little bit. Van Dyke Brown, Prussian Blue, Dark Sienna, a little black. And with that, let's go up in here and let's start picking out
some little basic shapes for trees and bushes that live way back. And all I'm doing is just tapping. Just looking for very,
very basic little shapes. I'm gonna take the same colors. Add a little white to it. So it'll be a little lighter. Right there. Put some little distant tree shapes. There we go. All kinds of happy little
things back in here. Okay, maybe right there. You just sort of have to make up your mind where you think a little tree
would live and drop him in. This oval brush does fantastic things. I really like it. It's easy to distinguish. It has a black handle, where all of our other
brushes have white handles. There. Okay, see, but that
easy it begins giving us some basic little shapes back in here. We're not looking for a lot of detail yet. Now, take the same old dirty brush, and go right into a little of the yellows. I have Indian Yellow,
Yellow Ochre, Cad Yellow. But just a little. Be right back. Get a little touch of the Sap Green, too. Not much color is on the brush, and I'm giving it a little push. That'll load the tips of it. Here, we can go in here
and begin picking out some of the little highlights that we see. And I want to keep these quite subdued. Quite dark. I don't want them to get too bright yet. There. Now, these are the ones that are far away. Far away. We don't see hardly anything
as far as detail goes. It's too far. And if you add too much detail, then you're gonna lose
that illusion of distance. There we go. These kind of scenes remind me of when I used to live in Alaska. I used to spend a great
deal of time just sort of walking through the woods and looking at the little creatures. And I used to hunt with a camera. Bring them back on film. That's the way to do it. Okay, see how you can make
all those little tree shapes? And I'm just sort of
dancing back and forth between the various colors. Once again, I don't want this to get too distinct and too bright yet. We'll have some brightness
in the foreground. But not yet. Let's take those same
colors on the liner brush. And on the liner brush with
a little paint thinner, bring it to a nice sharp point. And let's begin picking
out some indications of little stems and trunks and limbs and twigs, whatever. All those little things that you see when you walk through the woods. There. Just sort of look at
the foliage back here. Think where a little
limb would like to live if it had its choice. Which it doesn't, but
in your world it does. There we go. Put as many or as few as you want. Now then, we can begin
working a little closer. Same colors. Get a little Sap Green. A little of the Cad Yellow. Yellow Ochre. Indian Yellow. And then I'm gonna touch
the least little amount of the Bright Red. Sometimes I use Bright Red as a duller. I know it sounds crazy, but when you put red and green together, it makes a beautiful brown. So sometimes red is used to dull color. There we go. Now we can begin putting
in a little more detail. And look at those beautiful
little soft things that you can make with this. There. Just barely touching them. But you have to still
think about shape and form. Don't just hit random. If it helps, give each one of
these little bushes a name. There we are. Same right there. There's one. We have to give credit
to Richard the cameraman, 'cause he took that little bird. And the first time he had ever handled one of them little rascals. I'm telling you, it has
some very sharp claws on it. But he was brave. He was brave. He'll probably want a raise now. There. Pick out all these little things. See, now there's a little
of the Bright Red in there. Just a tiny amount. Just gives it sort of an orangey flavor. There. Let's step back and take a look at how your limbs and
leaves are coming together. If you don't like them, change them. You have unlimited power here. You can do any old thing. Darker and darker down in here. See, there's one that's got quite a bit of the Bright Red in it. It's gorgeous. (Bob mumbles) I like that red so much, maybe I'll put a little right there, too. In your world, you put any
color that makes you happy. Painting is as different as people are. All right, maybe right in here
we have another little bush. And see how this little
oval brush just makes layer after layer after layer
of these little rascals? And it's very easy. Even if you've never painted before, this one will make it easy for you. That's the reason I designed this one. 'Cause people were having some problems until they practiced with the other one. This one, no problems. There. But you do have to worry about shape. You can't just throw things in. You need to leave some
dark areas in between so there's depth and distance. Now then. I'm gonna go back to
my little liner brush. A lot of paint thinner. And those same colors. The background colors we were using. Let's go in here and put an indication of a few more little sticks and twigs. You have to have some of those in there to bring it all together. Something to support it all. There. Okay, just wherever you
think they should live. You only see pieces a lot of times. You don't see the entire tree trunk. You only see little pieces that stick out. And over in here, the same thing. Need a few more over in here. But these little sticks, once again, they help create that illusion
of distance in your painting. Okay, now we can start
working forward in this. I'm gonna take another oval brush. I have a couple of them going here. I'm gonna take some Dark Sienna. We'll use a little of that black again. A little Prussian Blue. Same colors. I'll probably use those
throughout this painting. Just tap a little color in there. And maybe we have a nice
bush that lives right there. I want this one to be brighter, so I'm making the background dark ground. Boy, sometimes your tongue
gets over your eye teeth and you can't see what you're saying. Make the background
(chuckles) a little darker so our lighter color will show up better. There we go. Okay, now then. Go back to my other oval brush. And let's take, we'll go into
some yellow, yellow, yellow. Be right back. Grab a little of the red. Ooh, nice color. Very nice color. Now, just by touching, we can begin making all kinds of little things back here
that are much brighter. See, if you didn't have
that dark back there, it wouldn't show up as well. You need that dark, 'cause that dark's gonna be our shadows. That's gonna be our deep shadows. I'm gonna add a little of the red to that. Ooh, that's nice. That is nice. Just tap. See that dark area there? That's the most important
part of that bush. And I know I keep saying that, but if it doesn't work for you, that's probably what's happening. 'Cause this starts working
so well and feels good and you get carried away, and the next thing you know
you've killed all of those. They've just gone away. So be careful. Don't let them get away from you. They're too valuable. Too valuable. There. Okay, now I think it's
time to really get crazy. Maybe in our world, I'll tell you what, maybe there's a big tree
that lives right there. You know me and my big trees. Let's take some of that black and blue. Dark Sienna. Once again, I'm gonna
use these same colors. Okay, we're gonna load this
brush to a chisel edge. And we do that by pulling it through the paint and giving it a little wiggle. And you can load it so it's quite sharp. See there? Good. Now with that we have to
make a major decision here. Maybe we're gonna have a
tree that lives right there. We'll put the indication
of a little trunk. Just something like so. This tree lives right off the
top of the canvas somewhere. And it's deep in the woods. Deep in the woods. Maybe it didn't get a
lot of light sometime. So it's skinny in places, and maybe in other places
it's big and heavy. There. I like to do trees like this. They're so gorgeous. I like these old evergreens that just have the big hangy-down limbs on them. Hangy-down limbs. That sounds like the name of a song. There we are. Okay, just let it go
down farther and farther. There. Maybe to about there. That's good. Let's give him a friend. Shoot, you know me. I think everything needs a friend. Even a tree. Even a tree. Let's give him one right there. Okay. Right over there. You just sort of work back
and forth with this brush. Just back and forth. Create all kinds of beautiful effects. There. Okay. Taking our old tree here we can make out here and there a little touch of trunk. So we'll just take some white. A little Dark Sienna. A little roll of paint on the knife. Let's have the light
coming from that direction. You have to make these big decisions. I'm putting the indication here and there of a little bit of the trunk
that's showing through. You don't want to see much. Don't want to see much. I'll tell you what, let me
wash one of these oval brushes. (loud tapping) (laughs) That one's not as
much fun as them big ones. They splatter everywhere. Now then, we'll take some of our yellows. Yellow Ochre, Indian Yellow, a
little bit of the Bright Red. Just sort of mix them all together. And let's put a few
highlights on these trees. Let's let them shine
out here in the light. We said the light's coming
from the left over here. So in that case, we need to
have it a little bit brighter on the left side than
it is on the right side. There. Okay, maybe here and there
we'll go into a little touch, a little touch of the Bright Red. Oh, isn't that pretty? Isn't that pretty? See how you can make these little trees just sort of hang down? There they are. Wherever, wherever, wherever. There. All right, right on down
into just darkness down here. Let's do that on the other one, too. Same colors. Same basic colors, here we come. Pay attention to shape and form though. There we go. Now if you have trouble making this stick, or if you want to put a little
sheen, a little shine on it, dip your brush in a little
bit of the Liquid Clear and then do this. It makes some of the
most beautiful effects you've ever seen. Beautiful effects. And when it dries, as I say, it'll have a little shine to it. It'll almost glisten. In fact, let's do that. I'm gonna dip it into
a little Liquid Clear. What the heck. 'Cause I want this one to
shine when it's dry, too. But don't overdo. This is a special little
gift in your painting. Don't overdo it. 'Cause it'll lose its
effectiveness if you do. Just here and there. Just here and there. And that rascal will
shine in the sunshine. Sing. There. And here and there, maybe we'll add a little touch of the Sap Green. I don't want much green in this tree. I want it to look... There, I like how all these
colors are just shining through. Isn't that a gorgeous little tree, though? That old oval brush will do that for you. Now, back to my Sap Greens, all that. I'm gonna grab a little Alizarin Crimson and throw in there, too. Right in with that ochre. Shoo, oh, that's pretty. Alizarin Crimson and Yellow Ochre makes some beautiful colors. Now then, let's begin
putting all kinds of little things that are living here. In my mind, the light's coming
right from that direction and shining across. So that's the way I want it to look. I'll grab a little Dark Sienna
and put in there with it. I'm just varying all these colors. I want to keep it in
the brown tones, though. And the yellows and oranges. Nice, nice, fall-looking colors. There we go. Wherever. Darker, darker, darker over in here. I want this to sort of fade out. We'll have one bright area right in here. The rest of it we'll let
be much, much darker. Now if you really want to make it look nice and bright and shiny... Let's just drop this in real quick. In a couple places where
light would strike, I'll show you how to do that. I'll put in a little background
color here real quick. There. Watch here now. Right in here, maybe
that'll be our bright spot. I wanna take... Let's go into a little
bit of the Titanium White. Just a little, and we're gonna
really brighten that color. Think where light would strike. And in my mind, it's gonna
hit right along in here. There. And maybe right here. Wherever. But this will be the brightest
spot in the whole painting. We'll just sort of let
that fade right on out as the light gets behind
the trees and everything. Just a little maybe here
and there zings through, but most of it's gone now. There. And that's the only time in
this painting we'll use that. Now then, let's just begin
working forward here. Still using all the little fall colors. There we are. Isn't it a neat little
brush that works so well? A little highlight here and there. You could do entire paintings
using nothing but this. Nothing but this brush. If you wanted to. If you wanted to. There we go. I tell you what. You know me, I like old big trees. I think maybe we're
gonna really get crazy. A little bit crazy today. This is your bravery
test on this painting. Let's go up here and
grab a big bunch of this Van Dyke Brown, a little
Dark Sienna with it. Pull it out flat. We can get a big roll
of paint on our knife. You ready? Our tree is gonna live (Bob imitates bomb shrieking) right there. As I say, this is your bravery test. And when I said big tree, I think I meant big tree. (Bob imitates plane engine) I like to do these old big ones sometimes. They're a lot of fun. The big old tree lives right there. Just comes right on down. There we are. Over on this side. There. (Bob grunts) I told you that was a big tree. I told you that was a big one. Okay, maybe take a little brown and white I happen to see laying right here. Okay, maybe a light's
zinging right through here. Just like you were putting
snow on the mountain, though. Just touch it. No pressure. No pressure at all. We'll just let it wander
right down the side there. This Dark Sienna and white. There we go. (Bob grunts) There. Isn't that a super easy way, though, to make very nice little
bark-looking areas on the tree? Works well. And maybe, I'll tell you what, maybe there's another one here. Maybe it had a friend that fell over. The old tree fell over. It had a bad day. A big wind came through
here and crashed it. Maybe it was a long time ago, and it's starting to deteriorate away now. You know if you see old logs in the woods there's places where it rots faster than it does other places. And it comes out looking funny. Maybe it goes all the way off the canvas. There, look at that. Now then. Boy, we really did put a big log in there. Let's take some white,
a little Dark Sienna, a little touch of the
Yellow Ochre in there, too. Get our little roll of paint
right on the edge of the knife. Now all we have to do here is just touch. It'll pull off what it wants. Like there's a little light
zinging in right through there. Now, I want it to look like it's open, so I'm gonna leave the dark
on the end and work back. It'll allow it to pick up that dark paint so it gets darker and darker and darker as the light slides over the top of this. Maybe back here there's a big old root that's still hanging on. But it's gonna get into
shadow there pretty soon, and we're not gonna be
able to see a whole bunch. The light playing right through there, but it gets darker and darker and darker. There, very quickly it gets darker. Just make that highlight on top. (Bob grunts) Look at that old log. See him laying there? All right. All right. I like them old rascals. Sometimes it's fun to
take this little brush, and instead of using it sidewards, go straight in and give it a little push, and it'll make like little ferns and stuff that sort of hang over. Like so. A little more color. Then we can go back and just begin tapping in all
kinds of little things. Get a little more of this Sap Green. There we go. But vary the colors and put them in the
way that you want them. Just however you want them. There. I want to get much darker
here in the foreground. Much, much darker. In fact, we're using
very little color now. Very little paint. Darker, darker, darker. Darker. It's behind this log that's fell down. Very little light's gonna sneak over here. There. And we're just basically gonna fill the rest of the canvas
up here with some little, little things like that. Now then. Here and there maybe you wanna
show a little more detail. And you can do that by
just adding a little color. But I don't want a great deal. It'll lose that effectiveness. Keep it dark in the foreground. There we go. Okay, tell you what. Let's grab our liner brush. Going through that. I'm gonna get some Van Dyke Brown and a little Dark Sienna. All right, make it very thin. Let's go up in here and
maybe our big old tree here has got a big limb that
hangs off right there. Squmph. But wiggle it and jiggle it. Let it be a loose, flowing limb. There, look at that. That limb's got character. It's not just a plain, old limb. It's got character. There's one up here. It's just sort of hanging off. (Bob grunts) You gotta make those little
noises to get it to bend right. (Bob chuckles) All right, and just however many you think should be showing on this. There. There we are. A little bit of light color on top. And you can highlight those a little. Just to make them look a little nicer. A little light's zinging
through there, too. I'm gonna take a little bit of the yellows and greens. A little paint thinner. And here and there we can
just pull up a little, little grassy things that live in there. Wherever you think they should be. There. How's that? If you wanted to, you could even end it by maybe putting an indication
of a big one right there. Zoom. Maybe an old dead one. There we are. Put a few little limbs on him. I think we've got a
pretty nice little scene that looks like it's
real deep in the woods. I hope you enjoy this one. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting. God bless, my friend. (gentle music)
