- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, because today I thought we'd
to a fantastic little painting that I think you'll enjoy. So I tell you what, let's start out and have 'em run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint
this little painting that we're gonna do today. And come on up here, let me show you what
I've got done already. One of my favorite things
in this painting technique is black gesso. And today let's do one that
has a lot of black gesso. And I've put this on using
nothing but a paper towel. I just wadded up a paper towel and just sort of dobbed it all over. And I wanted it darker at
the bottom than at the top. So I really put a lot down here and up in here I just sorta let it, just play around and barely touched. Then I took a foam brush, I want a big tree in this painting and that's about all I know of 'em. So I put the basic shape of a large tree. And now we're gonna
take and we're gonna do something a little different today. Today I'm covering this
as you caught me doing with a mixture of liquid
clear and sap green. Now I've taken and made
this 'til it's very thin. Almost like liquid white normally is. It's almost, it's not quite a liquid, but it's very, very thin. And instead of putting
liquid white on the canvas like we normally do, today we'll put, well let's call it liquid
green, what the heck. And come on up here and
let's finish doing that. And all we're looking for is just like with the liquid
white, a very thin, even coat all the way across the canvas. And just sort of scrub it in. It's that easy. And with this liquid clear you can make any liquid color that you want. I think it's better to use
sort of transparent colors, but you really can do this
with any color that you desire. And you will not believe
some of the effects that you can achieve with this. There. But because this sap
green is so transparent, all the little things that we did with the black gesso show through and already it's beginning
to give the illusion of a lot of little bushes and trees that are far, far back in the distance. And I think I'll do a little scene that looks like we're deep in the woods. I really like those kind of scenes. There. And as I say, all we're looking for is a nice, thin, even coat. Now the black gesso of course,
is allowed to dry completely before you put the liquid color on. But we don't want the liquid color to dry before we start. There. Alright. Let me wash the old brush. And we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner. Be sure it's odorless,
otherwise you're gonna be the most unpopular person in the house. Shake off the excess, (chuckling) and just
beat the devil out of it. Alright. Now let's really have some fun. Let's take that same
old brush, we'll go into a little titanium white. Be right back, let me get a little touch, little touch of cad yellow
maybe and put in there with it. Now this is just titanium white with a little bit of cad
yellow mixed together. Not much yellow, just a little. Okay, let's go right up in here. Now you sorta have to decide what's gonna happen where. I'm just gonna take
the corner of the brush and begin swirling in
some little patterns. Now the sap green is very transparent. The white is opaque. So now things are gonna start happening. Load a little more color on there. There, you just swirl this. I don't wanna cover up every
bit of the green though. I want some of it to show through. And in some places the white's gonna be so thin that you literally
can still see through it, even though it's opaque. And play with this, you'll be amazed at some of the effects
that you can achieve. Absolutely amazed. This is one of the neatest things that we've ever come up with. There. But you can just make it look like the sun is zinging through there and all kinds of beautiful
little effects are happening, just sort of turn your imagination loose. Let it go, let it go. That's what painting is all about. There. A little bit showing
through the trees up here. Wherever where. Okay. Now then, I have several
of each brush going so I don't have to spend all
of my time washing brushes. So we'll take a nice dry two inch brush and very gently, using just the corner, just begin blending all that together. And you can blend this to any degree of softness that you want. So as you're doing this, step
back and take a look see. 'Cause it's very hard to see your painting when you're right up against it. Just step back and take a look and see if it's blended as much as
you wanted or not enough. And you could always add
more of the titanium white to make it brighter if you want. So you're not committed, you can do anything
here that you wanna do. There, just gently blend it. And leave some of these
areas a little brighter. When it's all done it
will begin looking like light shining between
trees, way in the distance. And as oil paintings dry, they'll loose a little
bit of their brilliance they'll dull down just a little bit. Not much, but just a little. So you make it a little bit brighter than you actually want it. And by the time the painting's
dry, then it'll calm down. There. But isn't that a fantastic way of making just a background that's almost unreal. I love these kinda little things. My mother loves these things. She really likes these paintings
that are deep in the woods. And right now she's not feeling too good. She's in the hospital while
we're making this show, so let's dedicate this one to my mother. She's my favorite lady in the whole world. So Mom, this one's for you. Hope you feel better soon. There. Okay, now then, now then, I'm gonna take, take a little bit of the paint thinner and I'm gonna take a little bit of, well we'll use a little
black, a little sap green, be right back back, just mix
'em together on the brush here. Let me get a little more paint thinner. Need just a touch more of the thinner. There. You want this to be very thin, almost the consistency of ink. Alright, now then let's go up in here. Let's begin thinking about
all kinda little tree trunks and sticks and branches
that live way back in here. Now if you have the paint thin enough it'll flow right over the top of this. 'Cause that titanium white you
put in there was very thick. It's very thick, it's very dry paint. Much drier than traditional oil paints. And I know, I hear this every day. People go to the art store
to get some very dry paint and they'll tell 'em
it makes no difference, just use whatever they happen to have. It does make a difference. Really. If you have a soft paint, you just absolutely can't
paint over the top of it. Because it just blends together and we become mud mixers. There. And if you have a little
nervous twitch to your hand it makes much nicer tree branches. So just sorta let 'em wiggle and jiggle and wherever you think they should live. All these little things. Wherever. And if it gets to where it
doesn't wanna slide easy, all you have to do, add a little more paint
thinner to your brush. There. Okay. Now then, tell you what, let me clean this, let's just clean this liquid clear and sap green off so I have a place to work. We'll put a little of if over there, maybe we'll use it in a minute. And let's take a little white,
a little bit of sap green, this'll be our highlight
color when we get to it and I'll just mix it and set it over here. A little cad yellow, yellow ochre, ooo, we just leave it right there, that's our highlight color. Now then for base color, I'll use black, sap green, add a little touch
of yellow ochre into it. Just a little yellow ochre. Now we have two piles of color, our dark and our light. Let me clean the old knife off here. And I just wipe the
knife on my paper towel. Today let me introduce
you to a brand new brush. Today we have a half size round brush. This is a very small round brush. I've used other ones in the
past, but they were quite large. This one's a half size. It's much easier to
control, tiny little brush. And we load it by just tapping,
just tap a little color right into it. And let's go up in here. Now then maybe in our world there lives, just use the brush like so, tap in maybe there's a happy little tree. He lives right there, right there. There, let a little of
that trunk show through. Okay and he's got a friend. There's his friend. You know me, I think
everybody needs a friend, everybody needs a friend. But look at that, isn't that
a fantastic little brush? Little rascal works, maybe, yeah why not? Let's have some nice little things that are living right over in here. There. Just tap 'em in. Think about general shape and that's really all
you have to worry about. The brush does the rest
of the work, just tap. Just tap. But do think about basic shapes. There. Little bit in here. And because we have the
black gesso under here, we don't have to worry much down in here. Most of your dark color is already in. It's already in for ya. Maybe we'll have a little,
how 'bout something like that? And these little paintings
will just sorta happen if you just start playing
and looking at 'em, they just really sorta happen. Because you begin seeing little things that live back in here. And the more that you paint
and the more that you practice, the more that you're
able to visualize these. You really don't have to
trace and have patterns and all that stuff on here. You really can learn to
be creative as you paint. And it's like anything else,
it takes a little practice. Chances are you didn't
drive the car real well the first time you tried. But with a little practice,
got very good at it. 'Course the other day I met a driver, I think had never done
more than that first time. He almost ran me off the road. Alright. Now then. We'll just use that same
brush and I'm gonna dip it into a little touch of the liquid clear. That'll be our thinning agent. Because as you know, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. And the color that we put up there was very thick, very dry. Now then by just pushing, see
the edge of those bristles now has a little bit of
that light color on there. And the liquid clear has
made it a little thinner. So let's go up in here. Now think, if this is our
light source right in here. Think about light just
zinging right through here, just making all kinds of
beautiful little things in there. Wherever you think they should live. There. Don't kill all your dark. This starts working well and you have a tendency
to get carried away. There. Something like so. And this other little tree here, we'll give him just a touch
of highlight right there. There. Okay, a little bit over in here. Think about shape and form
when you're doing this. Don't just hit it random. You won't be happy with me. And this one, put a little bit on him. There we are. Something like so. This'll be a fantastic place for my little creatures to live. I have all kinda little creatures. Shoot I got squirrels and
crows and just everything. Fact, I tell you what, I'm gonna
put on a few more of these. While they're doing that, let me show you one of my little creatures. This is, I wanna have 'em
bring up a little raccoon here that I play with. This came from one of our rehab ladies real close to where I
live, named Carmen Shaw. And I borrowed him, he's a loaner raccoon. But he's the cutest little devil and he's so much fun to play with. But they do grow up and they
get a little nasty sometime. Boy them little rascals can. So if you're raising a raccoon, be careful when they grow up. They're pretty tough little characters. But when they're babies
like this, God's never made a more delightful little thing. And they're just like
feeding a little baby. The way they just lay
there and when they're done you pat 'em on the back and they burp. I get sorta carried away
with these little characters. Shoot. My mother lives with me and her and I have all kinds of these little char, isn't that precious little devil though? See the milk run down his mouth. He's not very neat. There. Okay. There we are. We just putting some little
things here and there. And work in layers here. I'm just varying the
greens back and forth. Little cad yellow, a little Indian yellow. Little yellow ochre once in
a while, and now and then the least little touch of bright red. And the bright red, believe it or not, is your duller. It will make the green turn brownish, so use a little bright red
when you wanna dull the color. There. But mostly greens in this
particular painting, I think. And every once in a while I
dip back into the liquid clear just to get a little more of the thinner. Just to make it thinner. You could use paint thinner. I like sometime to use this clear because when it dries, at any
place that you put the clear will have a nice shine to it. It's almost like the painting was glazed. There we go. But think about how the bushes and stuff, I know, I know. I know, I see something here. Let's take, you know me, I get crazy. Let's take a little of the dark sienna and the Van Dyke brown and
white and mix it together. And leave it sort of marbled
like, don't over mix it, just leave it sort of like that. Get a little roll of paint
right on the edge of the knife. Now then, in my world there's gonna be a little path here. Just a little path right through here. Like that. There. Just start, let it get wider and wider as it comes toward you. Look at that. And see how that color
just jumps out at you against that dark background. That black gesso's one
of the neatest things we've ever come up with. I really love it. And the more you rub this
the more it'll pick up the green color underneath. There, and the darker it'll get. So you have to make decisions. Maybe, I don't know where
this path's gonna go. I guess we better make a
decision here pretty quick. Maybe it comes on out here, I don't know. Wherever you want it. And in your world you decide where you want your little path to be. And maybe you'll wanna paint a little raccoon sitting
right out there on it. You can do that. You can do anything that you wanna do on this piece of canvas. Absolutely anything. Let's mix a little more of
our highlight color here. And all I'm doing, once again, is tapping. Sorta give it a little push. So there's a little touch of paint right under the end of the bristles. And begin thinking about,
well maybe right in here. Maybe there's a happy little
bush that lives right there. Just think about the shape
of that little rascal. Let it come right on out to the path. Get darker and darker and
darker, down toward the base. Use less pressure, barely touch it. Barely touch it, just let
it graze down in there. There, now then maybe up in here, how 'bout right there. This one, is a little
darker, a little darker. It's back here more in the shadows, so he's a little quieter. Just a happy little tree
that lives back here and he watches everything. And he's got a little friend right there. There he is. There he is. I like landscapes so much, I
think, 'cause when I was a kid we lived way out in the woods. They had to pipe sunlight
in where we lived, it was so far out. And I spent a great deal
of time in the woods. And there wasn't any other kids around and I had to learn to
play with the creatures that were in the woods. That's why I like animals
and little squirrels and raccoons and all those things so much. Because they're very special. Very special. And when I got old, I
guess I didn't lose that, still like 'em. I wished I could take
'em all home with me. After a while you have to
sorta draw the line somewhere. Otherwise your house looks like a zoo. There we are. Okay. Now then we can take, oh we'll just take a
little fan brush here. That's a number three fan
brush, doesn't matter. And you can soften
these edges very gently. So it looks they're in shadow underneath some of these
little bushes and stuff. And it's a nice way to clean it all up and bring it together. There, very gently, just soften them. There we go. Okay. Now, we gotta start
making some big decisions here pretty soon. We'll put a couple more little sticks in and think about it for a minute. Use a little bit of the midnight
black with paint thinner. Maybe there's a nice
tree trunk right there that we can see. Paint should be extremely thin, though. Very, very thin. There. Maybe there's a little tree right here that we can make out in here, there, wherever. And you put a few in with a lighter color here and there if you want to. Just look at your particular painting, 'cause every painting that's ever done is gonna be different. No two will ever look alike,
and that's what makes it so fantastic. You don't want your
paintings to just look alike. There. Alright, let's start on this ole big tree. That's the fun part of
this whole painting. I'm gonna load a fan brush
with this midnight black. Just midnight black. There, okay, now then. With the black gesso we
have a basic shape in here. So all we have to do is just
sorta fill it in good and dark. There we go, maybe a little tree goes right on off like that. There. This is gonna be a huge tree. Want the edges to be sorta gnarly. Is that a word, gnarly? You know what I mean, all bumpity. Maybe it comes down like that. Maybe there's a, yeah, let's do this. Maybe there's a big ole root that comes way out here
in the path nearly. 'Cause if you're walking
down the path here and you get tired, this is where you'd sit and maybe you had a little picnic lunch, you could sit there and
kick back, put your foot up, watch the little squirrels play. Yeah. I like to do that. I'm a big time hunter. I take my camera to the woods
and shoot 'em with a camera. There. Okay, do the other side of the ole tree. He comes down, maybe like that. Maybe like that. This tree's got a lot of arms. There. And your tree, you decide how many arms you want it to have. And put 'em wherever you
think they should be. And if you look around
maybe out in your yard you've got a big tree that you'd like to put in your painting, you can get a basic idea and a basic shape just from that tree. And drop that rascal in. And you're not committed. Trees grow, they're like people. They grow just about every way imaginable. Every way imaginable
and all are wonderful. There, now then, I'll go back to my liner brush and put a lot of paint thinner
in it, lotta paint thinner. Wanna make this very thin, very thin. Now then, maybe here and there we'll just put the indication
of a few more little branches and stuff that are just
sorta dripping off there. They just hang around
and have a good time. There we go. See, wherever you want 'em. Wherever and when you're doing this, don't just try to copy. Do what you wanna do. Art, painting, should be very individual. Very individual. We all see nature through different eyes. And you should paint what you see. Not what somebody tells
you is right or wrong. Paint what you want. Maybe there's a big ole limb
that lives, wah wah wah, right there. Gotta make those little
noises or it doesn't work. There we go, see, there he is. It's that easy. A little more of the paint thinner. Maybe we'll have, maybe
there's one over here that just goes right on off the canvas. It doesn't matter. As I say, trees are so individual. Any way that you want
'em, that's the right way. Now then we'll take a little dark sienna, Van Dyke brown, mix 'em together. About like so, we want it marbled. Pull across and get our
little roll of paint. Now then, this is the fun part. Touch, no pressure, no pressure. Let is just float down the tree. Just float. Barely, barely touching. Barely touching, just float. This ole tree limb out here, let him come down. But see there? No pressure, I know you
get tired of hearing me say that over and over. But that's the secret to it,
that's what makes that paint break and look like that. Is the fact that there is
no pressure on the knife. It's just like, well if you've
painted mountains with me in some of the previous shows. It's the same principle. No pressure at all. And if you learn to do that then you can use this knife to do, well you can do entire paintings. In some of the series
we've done in the past, entire paintings have been done
using nothing but the knife. Now we'll take a little
white and Prussian blue, I want a very dark blue. And over here on this side, I'm gonna put just a little hint of blue
and that's to indicate like a little reflected light,
just plays through there. Just here and there. And go back, take our black, and then we can pull limbs
over the top of other limbs. You have to make decisions, which limb's in front, which one's behind. And you can do that. See, that pulls that limb
right directly in front. That easy. That easy. Now, back to our little half size round brush. Little bit of the highlight color and down here around his little foots, we can begin putting in some little grassy things
that live in there. Back in here, very dark. This is behind the tree,
it'd be in a lot of shadow. Very dark over there. And just put in all kinds of things. This little brush works so well. I don't know why I didn't
have it a long time ago. There. See, if we just let all
those little things happen. And this is what begins
creating those illusions of depth and distance. There we go, something like so. Now then, we can take our liner brush, a little bit of that brown and white. Some of these larger limbs here, you can put a little
touch of highlight on 'em. Something like that. Something like that. And sometimes you can get a little crazy. Maybe right up in here we just draw a little silhouette maybe, a little silhouette. There's my little squirrel. Put in a big bushy tail And he sets up here and he
watches the whole world go by in this beautiful little forest. See, just a little silhouette. That's probably Peapod,
the pocket squirrel. We showed him in one
of the earlier series. Alright, I think we're about to the point we can sign this one. Take a little red, come right down in here, and we'll sign it. I certainly hope you've
enjoyed this painting. Try these black gesso paintings. I believe you'll find that
they work so fantastic even if you've never painted,
these'll work for ya. From all of us here, I'd
like wish you happy painting and God bless my friend. (bright music)
