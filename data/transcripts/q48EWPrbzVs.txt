Oh welcome back well here we are on the last show of the ninth television series and I'm certainly glad you joined me today so for this show I thought we'd do something a little bit different a nice happy little painting and I've already started out here and I've taken liquid black as you can see and went right around here and then right in the center just liquid white and sort of that'll blend together right here where they where they come together liquid black is exceptionally good for areas where you going to have a lot of dark shadows - very dark colors you can put that in saves you a lot of work so let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to base this painting along with me and we'll come on up here and get started already let's start off today with a touch-up phthalo blue and we'll just tap little that into the brush and we can add a little black to that - just to dull it down there we go small amount of color let's go right up here start right at the top and as usual make our little crisscross strokes just like so just like so very nice easy to do and we'll bring it down to about like that okay and very gently go across to take out the brush strokes and that quick we got a happy little sky I wash our brush shake off the excess and we'll get the cameraman again he has caught the devil I'm gonna go right into titanium white and just pull it bursts through it just tap a little cover right into it okay let's go ahead up here maybe there's a happy little cloud that lives up here in the sky they just sort of floats around see I sort of pull it around like that this is just straight titanium white we just want the indication of a little something happening in there we're not looking for a lot of detail far away there we are okay and I'd quit we have a happy little cloud in this series we've made a lot of different clouds we've made some great big stormy clouds and some with a lot of color in and we've made some beautiful seascapes I really really hope you've enjoyed those also let's spill us a little mountain back here let's take some black some Van Dyke Brown a little touch of blue shoot let's throw some crimson in there too so we get blue brown Lisbon crimson and black pull it out very flat now cut across and get our little roll of paint we always use that little roll of paint okay now then we're going to have a nice little Mountain that Liz we back here push that paint right into the fabric just really push hard work it in it just pushes there we go there is the only thing you worried about is this nice outside edge okay we'll take a large brush grab you pull let it let it blend with a liquid white there see it just disappears right into nothing just nice misty effect okay what takes them let's take a little titanium white cut us off a small little roll of paint just a tiny bit and let's go up here and jazz let the knife float just let it float I will put him put in some nice highlights and you could do this in colors you might wanna I want to melt and it's brown with all kinds of beautiful rocks and stones works the same way same way so in your world you decide and you make it any way that you want it let's take some white some labels blue and a little bit of Van Dyke Brown to that there we go the brown is just used to dull that blue down a little bit so it's not quite so bright cut off that little roll of paint okay Pat it come right back in here see there that easy easy just put in some nice little shadows we just sort of let those work great together all right together and you wander back in here and pick up some of the white sand or you can just make all kinds of things happen in your mountain oh okay you're limited only by your imagination only by that nothing else what you can see in your mind you can put on canvas there we are to an artist maybe imagination is one of the most important things that you can possess so develop your imagination it's like any other muscle in the body use it use it exercise it practice with it you'll be amazed at what you can imagine pretty soon if you paint you become very aware of nature you become aware of color and you're riding down the street and you'll see a beautiful tree and you'll say oh look at the SAP green in that tree or the or the white in that cloud that's made with a fan brush you had to be careful though you'll get so I'm so interested in all the beautiful things that nature has you drive right off the road I always carry a camera with me and I take pictures all over the country of the different different areas okay I'll go right back into that mountain color and to that I'll add a little more blue the white I am looking for a bluish bluish color but about my cat that's a nice color okay let's go right back up here maybe maybe there's a happy little Foothill it lives right there see see it there yes it lives right there in that brush just tap it out tap it out there and I think I've mentioned some of the other shows most of the ideas that we we use to do paintings come from people all over the country if you have something you'd like to have painted drop me drop me a line I'd love to hear from you and some people send postcards or photographs tell me what interests you if it's something I can't do shoot we'll go out and get us a guest artist we'll bring him in and we get them to show you how to do it there we go and with a completion of this series there are kasha one hundred one hundred and seventeen shows now if you haven't seen them all in your area give your station a call let them know what you want to see them there you go there you go okay let's have some fun I'm gonna take will take black we put some brown in there and sap green looking for a very very dark color you throw some blue in there - it doesn't matter okay let me clean my knife off let's grab us a fan brush load that fan brush full of color a lot of paint in the brush a lot of paint okay glad let's go up here now then I want to do some happy little everines I like evergreens just use a corner of the brush and go back and forth there see let's give him a friend therese gets lonely too we all need a friend there we go now that may be Teddy or there has another one let's just put a bunch of them in here I like to do these and some some parts of the country evergreens are real skinny in other parts they're sort of fat so either way you want they're made basically the same way and trees are like people they have personalities each one's different each one's individual it's unique and different it's really different so don't worry about it if your tree didn't look just like the one you use that you see here that means they're probably better we really are not trying to teach you to copy with these we're trying to show you how to make effects and turn you loose on the world as you can all in the world there I see I'll tell you what I'm just going tree crazy let the more of these little trees you do the more practice you'll get and that easier they'll become a good way to practice is just take old canvases or something and and just do a whole canvas full of trees or mountains or skies or whatever it is that you're having problems with the best way to overcome a problem area is to do it over and over until you learn maybe there's another happy little tree not a happy little tree there okay well we got a mess of trees going in there almost have us a little forest so I'm gonna take side of the dark sienna a little white cut through have a tiniest little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife let's go up here now with that I'm gonna sleep back in here and just here and there at indication of a little little trunk we don't want these trees to to fall over these are strong on treason happy tree affection everything we paint is happy your paintings reflect your mood you're in a bad mood you'll paint a angry old painting that's when you do the big storm clouds and when you're happy your paintings will reflect that they'll be bright and cheery and the colors will be super all right tell you what must do let's go right into this dark color this was the old tree color and I'm just going to tap this brush right in there now we need something for all these evergreens to set on right now they're just sort of floating around so let's begin let's begin creating the lay of the land see if this was a white background here if you had liquid white this color would be would be a lot more difficult to apply cause the darks already in there it just drops in real easy I don't know if you can even see it but it's there now watch what happen otherwise let's go right into some yellow yellow I'm going to reach up here and get some SAP green so we have yellow and SAP green and tap this brush firmly into the color all right now there and then this will really show up against the dark and this is where we want to create once again a lay of the land see if we can making big decisions here out of this go I see little Hills so I'll paint little Hills and whatever you see in your painting in your world that's what you want to paint look at that see it just hill after hill many as you want or as few as you want let's go right over here don't this side to be left up there we go and if you want it darker all you have to do is continually tap you just have on it and it's gonna pick up the liquid black and automatically it's gonna get darker you don't have to worry about it it just happens okay I want a stone maybe we'll do a bunch of rocks on this one there's a stone it lives right about there there's a nice stone see now how do you make a round stone with a square knife that's your project for today they just go right around see put some highlight on look how that stands out that's just some dark Sienna with a little white in it and that easy we have a nice little stone now you can take and pull a tiny bit of that color down to make it look rougher that's what my dog says ruff there okay I will take a little more of our green and yellow mixture right on the brush and let's take and we come right down here at the foot of this rock see there and that lays him right in the painting didn't that super layer after layer okay maybe made me maybe there's a another stone those right here let's let's put a bunch of stones in this one there are a lot of fun a lot of fun there's another one wherever you want tell you what maybe this is a big stone let's have a big old stone huh I just get carried away here these stones will you're not careful they'll grow and you they'll eat up your whole world so what started out as a little stone turned into a big one and we'll use those same colors just this is a little bit of dark Sienna touch it white and you just let this graze it just barely touch graze the most delicate delicate touch imaginable pretend pretend you just a whisper and you're just floating across there you're just barely touching Carissa and it will come back just tap in some color see and that'll bring all that together look at all the stones here comes one right down oh I see something here let's have some fun let's get crazy let me find a fan brush thing clean when you're painting you see things in here they happen don't fight them learn to use them learn to use them watch here this would just end my mind be a super place for happy little stream so I'm going to take a little liquid white and go right into titanium white liquid white titanium white now back here I see a little stream watch here it comes from behind that rock maybe it falls over a little bit there some little splash and it wanders right through maybe it maybe it just falls every which way right there it runs it runs behind that rock right behind I see there now then and it disappears behind that rock comes out there and since it's closer to us here here it's kind of look a little bigger that easy you can make a little stream and then salan go back and firm up the edge on this rock so I push that stream back but that easy you can change your mind and create all kinds of fantastic effects I want to add a least little touch of blue a little touch of blue right underneath this water will have a little pool here little cool back into the brown let's bring some happy rocks right down through here there's another rock got to have something to contain this little waterfall maybe comes right down alright that there is another stone right there see all these different stones will help push everything back we'll put another one right here to sort of look and make sure that it's logical there something has to hold that watery and otherwise it run over the top of the rock yeah then a little bit of highlight on this rock where the light striking it soon delicate touch delicate touch there see and follow the angle of the rock soon and rocks are just like making little mountains they'll grow up be big strong mountains take some green and some yellow some yellow ochre let's grab some Indian yellow to just mix them together here on the fan brush go right up here and there's some areas here or maybe you want to put some happy shiny little bushes help cover up the foot on the rocks there's some things that are growing right here next to the waterfall look at there may be some big bushes living here big bushes all right and here we'll put some they make they're right out on that stone see how that helps push everything back fantastic knew you could do it there we go come right down through here see curve that follow the land let it Bend and if we're gonna have a little cooldown here we need to contain it somehow don't want it to get loose on this darker darker darker back up in here in the shadows Kenny let's come over in this side this looks like the kind of place my mother would like her and I used to go walking in the woods and we she's crazy as I am we talked to little squirrels and we hunt with a camera I used to be a hunter but in my old age I get to where I'd rather take pictures of the creatures and then shoot them there we go there we go all right now then let's let's play right in here I'm gonna take some quiet on a fan brush a little bit of the touch of the phthalo blue loathe the brush full and let's come right in here and this water is gonna hit down here and splash all kinds of low this waters gonna be rough down here st. right up to the little grassy areas and maybe the water just sort of sneaks under there we don't know mmm I see we had put blue with the liquid black under there so now it's picking up and all these beautiful little colors just happen just happen there we go that gives us a nice little pool for that water to run into I tell you what now we got these big dark sides here let's play a little bit over here back into my Van Dyck Brown and we'll pull it out very flat okay we'll add some dark sand with it I'm gonna flat cut across and once again our little roll of paint boy I know you get tired of seeing that but it's important how you load this knife and let's put up let's put a tree trunk right there right there maybe this old trunk there it is look see see just let it trunk come right down there we give my big foots now if I see big Flitz wasn't a tree there but we'll call this one it we've called this tree Bigfoot's and let's give that tree an arm needs a little arm out there and one over here wherever wherever is your tree so you put arms where you want them wherever you wanna take a little bit of the brown and Hoyt let's just drop in a touch of highlight look at that see against that dark boy that's the sparkles jumps out at you there we go yeah my brushes got the dark color this was that original dark mixture we just had everything and it's at green black brown blue now then let's go right up in here and this one I want to create little leaves that come off this tree and as always and as always we put the dark in so the light will show and because we had the liquid black on there a lot of this dark is already done we don't have to worry about it at all tell you what so much fun let's do them the other side maybe over here there's another tree this just sort of brings a whole composition together and fantastic I like doing these kind of paintings are so striking so striking they're fun they find they make you happy and that's that's what painting is all about it should make you happy there we go do some SAP green pick up some of that yellow ochre now when you're doing this if your paint won't stick at a little touch a paint thinner or the liquid white at just using the corner of the brush again tapping in basic shapes here we don't want to just hit random tap in some very basic shapes you know and I'm finishing this tree up I'd like to just take a second and thank a lot of fantastic people for making these programs possible all the people behind the scenes that you don't see they're super we have some of the best people in PBS here and absolutely the best director she yells at me a lot but she's good director and she makes these shows happen and there's just so many people that you never get a chance to meet and they're special there we go takes a lot of people to put these shows together and even the fantastic lady who makes all these beautiful shirts for me that's Annette and I think each and every one of them in the bottom the heart and most of all I thank you for turning on the TV air but we can allow this in do you make a lot of hard work with Wow there we go how just have some yellow and some green here pull that brush in one direction let's go right up here maybe let's put a little sparkler here in there maybe he lives right here in front of this tree hmm see push that tree right back let that work right down seeing that little bright son-of-a-gun boy he he shines against that dark really it really just is striking okay I had a little bit of liquid height a little more of the SAP green yellow and we don't want this side to be left out let's put up oh boy that's a nice one there that is a nice one okay it's already look around it there it is see there's a happy little Bush it lives right down here he lives right on the edge of the water so you can get a drink anytime he wants it there we go maybe here and there behind the rocks now then let's take a knife yeah we can just scrape through put a few little sticks here and there and we just about have a completed painting I think we'll call that one finished I really want to thank you for
