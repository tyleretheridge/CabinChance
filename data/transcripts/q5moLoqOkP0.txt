hi welcome back glad you could join me today I have a special treat for you you know we've had a young artist on the show in the past we've got literally hundreds of letters just raining preys on his fantastic abilities and I'm very prejudiced because I'm talking about my son Steve and I'm very proud of this young man I've asked him to come back today and show you what he can do in just a couple of minutes now Steve travels all over the country and he teaches literally thousands of people the joy of painting so I tell you what let's turn it over to Steve and I'll see you later Steve thanks dad okay we're going to do a simple painting today and use a lot of pastel colors unlike other things we've done before we're going to start off with just a little bit of Indian yellow on the two-inch brush and you want to tap that paint in real evenly on the brush okay then we're going to go up to the canvas just some little X strokes and try to make it look like the sunlight is just sort of blending out into the sky and maybe we'll just put in a beginning water reflection down here at the same time now I'm going to go into a little bit of a lizard and crimson use less of this color because it's very powerful and again always remember to tap that paint into your brush well now just a little bit of that up here we're going to be putting blue above this later so if you have this alizarin crimson in here it keeps the blue and the yellow from touching and we all know what you get when you mix blue and yellow together okay if you sort of dab your brush out a little bit then go over to a little bit of phthalo blue you can get that part in try to remember now that you're just blocking in a shape and later you're going to come back and blend it all out the colors that were using it a day will be ran across the bottom of the screen so you need to get hairs out that's a good way to take them out just use the edge of the brush okay now we'll do a little bit of blending with a clean dry brush you want to make sure that the definite lines between two colors disappear when you're doing this and of course you always want to keep in mind that if you go up into your blue and come down into your yellow that's a green sky okay so I just slowly move up here trying not to go back in my yellow and we can clean that brush out one more time and blend again whenever you're in doubt about what to do clean the brush and start new because a dirty brush will really hurt you on the sky now if you want to reflect these same colors down in the water you can start off with just a little bit of a lizard on one side of the brush a little bit of blue on the other and you can come down here in your water and just lay in some straight horizontal strokes always remember that still water lies flat okay and then wash your brush out now the same thing in the water you're trying to move the lightest color out into the darker colors so blend that yellow out and eventually you have to go all the way across it now you might pick up a little green in here but water is green anyway a lot of time so you don't have to worry about that too much okay now I'm going to use my number-6 fan and with some titanium white maybe just a couple of drops of liquid white we'll load the paint real evenly in the brush and maybe just a dot of alizarin crimson and that now you have to remember when you're working on your clouds is that they're light fluffy shapes on top and they're basically flat on the bottom so as long as you get a lot of little puffy things going in them up at the top you're doing okay okay so you get the basic shape in there and you can come back in with your big brush blend out the bottom of it pull it up real lightly and then go over the whole thing real lightly now it's very simple to make it look like you have two clouds one underneath the other you can just put in that shape and save a small dark area right here that's very important it takes dark to show light so you always have to remember the light is just as important as the dark and the dark is just as important as a light without one you can't have the other the same steps on that one and maybe there's one over on the left-hand side put a little bit more alizarin crimson with this one as you can see I'm really not trying too hard to make any definite shapes if you've ever studied clouds real carefully there are no definite shapes they're all just kind of out there okay now I'm going to use my one-inch brush and go into a new color that'll be a lizard and crimson phthalo blue just a touch and midnight black and I'm loading these colors on my brush to be sure I get a good variation of color and then you just come over to your white makes a little white in with that and you come up with a light lavender color you might need to drop a paint thinner and this to get it to stick to the canvas okay now we're going to go up here with the one-inch brush and just start tapping try to make your shapes very full instead of just leaving one line like this you need to fill it in I try to imagine what a hill looks like when I'm painting this part of the picture because um seems like if you envision something in your mind first it always comes out better okay now just lifting the top these are like distant pine trees okay and then almost the same thing you did on the clouds except for this time you just use a little bit of a lizard and crimson and sort of just smash and twist out the bottom of this the alizarin crimson gives you some pinkish glow at the bottom of your Hill if you're ever interested in selling paintings pink is just one of those colors that really catches someone's eye I do a lot of paintings with pink in them okay so I smash out the bottom and then I can load my one inch brush up some more and make one he'll come in front of the other as you watch the painting getting closer and closer to being finished you'll notice that about everything I do is the same steps they're all very simple you're either using dark to separate two entities or light here we're using mist light okay so I smash out the bottom of that one it looks like you have one hill in front of another now you might want to get some more of your black and alizarin on your brush and darken up that color about one value okay and maybe we'll make something come in from over here try to make this one look a little different so much of the problems with a lot of the first paintings I did was everything was just too organized or symmetrical so you want to try to thank very freely and get your hand to move over the canvas you know like a true artist you know you've got to have that true artist thing okay lift these up and you want to make sure you lift through the whole foothill to because the scratch is that the brush leaves in the paint helps indicate little trees to get a little bit more that alizarin crimson on your brush as you're tapping keep that pink in there okay now I can go into just some more that alizarin and black together but this time I'm going to put a little SAP green with it and leave it dark this will be our base color for the rest of the painting so all our dark shapes will be done with this these are trees and bushes in the background you don't have to get too over detailed on this because it is far away and it is going to be highlighted later so that will change things a lot right now you're just trying to get that dark color in there now I'm using my knife to scrape in a few little sticks twigs it's one of those things that makes the buyer of your painting or the viewer think that you spent hours and hours on it you can mist out the bottom of that a little too okay now I'm going to dip my one-inch brush down a little paint thinner shake off the excess and about what you got left in the brush is good so you're working with a paint that's about cool web consistency see now I'm loading the brush very full and I'm going to touch very lightly up here see if you go into a little bit of a little blue you get a nice light green color the shapes are very important here you're trying to make your bushes look round on top and the bottoms of them you don't need to worry about because that will all be covered up with land so you can also make grass by using the side of the brush to just push in long as you leave a dark space there maybe a little bit of bright red with that make sort of an ochre color now if you get to the point on your brush where it's so muddy colored that it won't show up you can dip down into your jar liquid white and use some of that to thin your paint and you come up with a much brighter color so you really don't have to wash your brush through here okay now if you come in with your palette knife a little bit of Van Dyck Brown what you want to remember here is to smash your paint out very flat and then put your knife straight down onto the palate and pull towards yourself and you end up with a small height of paint or a roll and then you're just going up to the canvas and touching and pulling to the left a real hard angle to the left and don't worry about grabbing some of that green that just cast that reflection under your land this is one of those things that looks a lot better after you pull the reflection out of it and put grass on top of it see it will do that now two inch brush and just pull down a little bit of that brown and if you put a little bit of leather color on there you can pull down some of that too okay and then you just want to go across that with a clean brush now you can reflect some of these bushes into the water doesn't have to be really distinct reflections like I said before this is still far away and go over those real lightly and the same way you did your graphs before you can tap in a little bit of grass on top of the land just trying to diffuse that line on top or the land of the bushes connect okay now with a little bit of liquid white on your palette knife spread it around on your palate and get just a little bit on your knife come up here and just like you're trying to scratch a hole in the canvas just a little water line something to separate the land from the water there okay now over here on this side I think we'll have a birch tree the way you do that is you get a roll on your palette knife and you're going to come up here just connect lines together by touching and the same thing over here try to put a little bend in your tree give it some character you can turn the knife upside down and fill on the other side and you want to make sure your trees are lighter at the bottom of course you can always straighten them up and we go in with the liner brush later so you really don't have to worry about this shape too much though okay now we can go over that with a little bit of titanium white just spread that out on your palate and get a nice little roll in there very lightly go over that tree kind of pull in a c-shape sort of a round that gives the trio round effect instead of flat okay now down along the bottom here I'm just going to smash in a bunch of foliage that's that same mother color throw all the bushes and background things we use the same color it's kind of a dark green okay and if you pick up your liner brush and go through a little bit of Van Dyck Brown you want to thin this down quite well about Indian ink consistency spin the brush through the paint okay now you can extend your tops and make some little branches you don't want to waste a lot of time on these branches because it seems like the faster you do them the better they come out you're releasing your pressure as you're coming out from the trunk the reason I say you can throw these branches in quickly is because you're going to cover them up with the next step which would be the foliage on the tree there is a neat thing about branches though if you have something you don't like all you have to do is just keep making more and more and pretty soon they look better okay now just like we did the bushes at the bottom smashing in some little rounded shapes when you get into this white on the cloud right here it's going to be a little rough you might want to thin your paint just a touch it's hard to get any color to stick on top of white okay notice I'm saving some big open areas I believe dad calls those places for the birds to build nests you don't want to close up too many spaces here otherwise you get sort of a huge apple tree like a big round ball if you've ever attempted this before you know it's easy to get sort of a large shape going accidentally okay so a little bit of the dark and then we'll come back in and highlight that with the same colors we use to highlight the land in the background so first a little bit of green for our bushes and then we'll do our tree it's really not as much how you do it is the shape that you make you can switch your colors back and forth whatever you want to use Indian yellow and liquid white make a nice color matter of fact that's what we'll be using on our tree today Indian yellow with liquid white so a little bit of liquid white and Indian yellow let's put a touch of bright red in there just for the heck of it see you can go into your indian yellow and just touch your bright red a couple times and you get some neat little orange leaf shapes only they're kind of orange with little red dots on the end and let's it go through a little bit of dirt down here in the bottom just Van Dyck Brown the same way we made the land in the background get a little grass on top of that I think this one's ready to sign I'll just use my liner brush and some bright red okay well I think that one's finished for today I'd like to thank you dead for letting me do the show today and happy painting Oh you
