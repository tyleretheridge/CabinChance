- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad to see you today. Tell you what, let's get right on today, and
have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint
along with us at home. While they're doing that, as usual, let me show you what I have. Today I have my standard ol' pre-stretched double prime canvas, and I've just covered
it with a very thin coat of liquit white. That's all, it's wet and ready to go, so thought today maybe we'd do, let's do a little winter scene, something that's let's just see what happens. Let's start with (chuckles), with black and blue, or blue and black, and we'll just sort of mix
them together on the brush, more black than blue, though. I thought we'd just
play a little bit today. It's such a wonderful day here, and I hope it is wherever you're at. So, just have a good time with this, there we are. We'll just, we'll just pop in a
little sky here and there. Something about like so. I'm going to leave in some spots open, intentionally. Just, little spots, I don't want
this to be a flat ol' dead sky. Want it to have some
life, some action to it. Shoot, tell you, why don't we
get a little crazy here. Oh, I've got several
of these brushes going, grab another one, put a little touch, a little touch, not much, a little touch of alizarin crimson. Maybe right along here, just so it's not too bleak. Sometimes winter scenes can
be very, very depressing. We're gonna put just a
little pink in there, just to give it a little warmth in the background, I don't want much. Don't want much, I still
want it to have a distinct winter taste to it. There we are. OK, we'll just play some of that right down
to the edge of that pink. And that's basically all it takes. There, blend it a little bit. And that's good enough. That'll give us a sky that, as I said, has a little
life in it, and some action is happening, it's not
just a flat ol' dead sky, you can see it light areas. And I like that in a sky. Shoot, that's working pretty good. Maybe we'll do the same thing down here, doesn't matter. Anything that we don't, don't use, we just turn it into a shadow. If this is a winter scene
maybe we'll have some snow, you gotta have shadows in the snow. Or maybe it'll turn out to be water. Who knows, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter, because
we can fix anything that can happen here, we don't, we don't concern ourselves with mistakes, we just have happy accidents. There. See? Something about like it. And that's a good way to clean the excess paint off your brush. M'kay, let's wash the ol' brush now. If you've painted with
me before you know that's really the fun part of this. It's really the fun part,
just washing the brush. There. (beating) (laughs) Isn't that fun? I usually just wipe the
brush on a paper towel to assure it's dry as
I can possibly get it. But, you'd be surprised at how dry it gets just from beating it like that. Let's take black, Purssian blue, little touch of crimson. Black, blue, crimson, and I'm going to get some white. Just take a little bit of white. I'm gonna mix up, hmm, put a little more blue in there. Yeah. Want it to have sort of a blue cast to it. Ooo, I like it. I like that, that's looking good. Maybe a little more white. You just mix it till it
gets to the flavor you like. And I think that's wonderful. It's sort of a drab blue color, it's not real bright. There, that's a nice winter color. All right, let's grab an old brush and load it full of color. We use the ol' fan brush today. Maybe in our world, back here, somewhere in the background, see this color is not... far away from the color
that's already on the canvas. Let's just push upward today
and make us a little tree. There, that's pretty close to the color that's on the canvas, and that's what we're
looking for, I don't want it to be too much farther away. Pretty close, pretty close. All right. There, maybe a little tree right there. And you decide how many
trees live in your world, it's up to you, totally
and completely up to you. As you've probably heard me say before, to me that's what's so
fantastic about painting. It's that each and every
person will paint differently, and that's what makes it special. If we all painted the same way, what a boring time it would be. You would know what the
finished painting was gonna be before you start. But because people are different, paintings are different, that's the beauty of it. That's what makes it very special. It allows you to show your individuality. There. How many trees do we want here? It's up to you, you decide. You decide, maybe you wanna a whole forest, maybe you just want a few. Maybe there's a little
baby one right there. He's not so big yet. Make up little stories, you know, people look at you like
you're a little strange, but that's all right. Painters are expected to be different. Let's have one more right there. One more. As I say painters are, painters are unique. I take advantage of that all the time too. Now then. I'm gonna take the ol' two-inch brush, I wanna create the illusion of mist down here at the base of this. The illusion of mist. So just by tapping, and we're just going to softly, softly disappear over here. I want these trees to just sorta look like they're just sitting
in a little misty area. Just breathing in the cold air. There we go. Something like that. But now we have a whole bunch
of trees in the background, it's very misty, cold looking, and already you have the
impression of winter. That easy. All right. Let's get a clean two-inch brush, time to have some fun. Let's have us a little snow in here. And to paint snow with a two-inch brush, very easy. Load it full of color. Full of titanium white. And we have, we already have this grey
color on the canvas, we, we put on and talked about it being like a shadow. Now, it's gonna pick that up. See there? And we just let it sorta
disappear over here. We don't care. We don't care. That easy. But isn't that fantastic? Snow is one of the easier things to paint in this technique. OK. You ready for a little, a little fun today? Maybe, tell you what, we film this show in Indian and there's a, there's a lot of old barns
here that just fascinate me. Let's paint an old barn today. One of the easiest ways is to take a, scrape out a basic shape, just sorta scrape it out. It doesn't have to be exact, and you're not committed. You're not committed here. So let's just decide what kind of old barn we want. Maybe it comes down like that, maybe it has a place over
here for the cow to sleep. It doesn't matter, you decide, barns come in all kinds of shapes. Farmers are like painters, they, they do it thier way. Yeah, that's what's so great
about being a farmer in this fantastic country. You can do it your way. All right. Have a lot of friends
here that are farmers. Have to get a brownie point in with them, cause they got the best food, and I like to eat. All right, on the other side,
about the same distance here. We'll just scrape out. I hope you can see, there's just a basic, basic shape there. And, as I mentioned earlier, you are not committed. Van dyke brown, dark sienna. You can change your mind at this point. Little roll of paint. Now let's begin picking out the little things in here. There's the back eave. see there? That easy. OK, now then. The ol' barn comes down, bloop-bloop-bloop-bloop. Gotta make those noises. There it is, see? All we're doing here is blocking in a little color. We'll come back and do a
barnectomy after a while, and cut it off wherever we want it. But right now all we're doing is putting in the dark. Putting in some dark color. There. Here we go, bloop, bloop. See there? Sorry I make those little noises, I sorta forget, cause I
really do make em' even when I'm by myself I make little noises. Sorta makes things work better for me. All right, and over here toop. There we go. See? That's really about all we're
looking for to block it in. And right in here would be a little dark paint. OK, now, let's take, let's take, let's take some white, dark sienna, a little vandyke in there, maybe even a little
crimson too, what the heck. Give it a little warm feeling. Don't over mix the paint. Cut off a littl roll of paint, then we can go up in here and just barely touch, just let it graze, see? Let it graze. Looks like old, old wood. If you've painted barns and
cabins and stuff before, you know I, I really like to paint old things. I'm an avid collector of antique glass, for example. I like old things. When you get to my age you have a tendency to like old things, you can relate to them. (chuckles) There we are. And I am old, older than dirt. (laughing) Let's take a little, a little vandyke brown and I want to darken that color... so that it's darker over here on the side, cause maybe not as much light's gonna hit over here. See? That's much darker. Now then. Let's put some boards in there, for that we'll just take
some van dyke brown, and we'll just put the
indication here and there of some little boards, some slabs that live in here. There. See there? I wish the barn was this
easy to build for real. My father was a carpenter and I built a few barns, it's not this easy. There. It's not this easy. There we are, something about like that. Now then. We need a roof on this barn, so the cow don't get cold. Let's take some titanium white. Since we said this was winter, maybe the snow is there. Let's just outline it so that way you'll get a nice straight edge when you pull it down, watch. (makes swooshing noise) See there? There we go, now then. Little more of the white. (makes swooshing noise) Little touch more. (makes swooshing noise) There. There we go. Ain't that neat? Looks like snow's piled
up on top of the ol' barn. Little bit over there, cause you'd see some on that side too. You would also see some here. And, oh, we got a whole section to go here. There, let me get some more white. Same thing though. I want to outline it a little
bit so you'll have a nice, straight edge. And then when you pull it some, nice straight edge. There we go. Something about like that. M'kay. There. But you can just move it, pull it, work it any way that you want to. All right, we need a door. OK, always gotta have a way
to get in and out there. Let's take some van dyke, decide where your door lives and (makes swooshing noise) Once again, don't worry about the bottom, we're gonna do, we're gonna do a barnectomy, as I mentioned earlier. we'll cut this rascal off wherever we want it to be. Which is about time to do now. Let's say the ol' barn, right along in there. See? Didn't take too much cutting on that one, sometimes I paint em'
where I have to cut a lot off the bottom, because I get carried away. Get carried away, get telling
stories and things begin just looking good and I
don't know when to stop. All right. That gives us a pretty nice, little barn. There it is. Let's find our two-inch brush. Ol' two inch brush. It's got a little snow on it, a little snow. Let's go up in here, and we'll put another plane, come right in there. (makes swishing noise) There we are. Watch that brown snow, you know what they say about it. There we are. Down in there. Over here on the other side we'll just bring it right up. Like that. And got a little snow around his foots. That easy. Once again, snow is so easy to paint when you're using a
big ol' two-inch brush. So easy to paint. Let me find a clean fan brush, there's one. Looks pretty good. Find us a place to work
on the ol' palette. Gotta have a big palette, big palette's very, very helpful. It's almost as important as having a, well as having... an easel that holds your paint firmly, your painting firmly. When you're using the two-inch brushes... you really need a good, firm... easel, a large palette. It'll pay you tremendous dividends. Mix up some color here right on the brush. Little Prussian blue, black, brown, a little crimson. All them good colors. Maybe. OK. (chuckles) Here we go. Maybe right here. I'm gonna put a little paint thinner, just to thin the paint,
it's a little thick. When you paint just a little bit, pretty soon you begin to get
a feel for it when it touches, if it don't wanna... pull just right, then you
can add a little thinner. But not, don't do that unless you have to. I just knew the paint wasn't
gonna come off the brush unless I did. I'm gonna have a happy little tree, he lives right there, just a little guy. A little guy. Right on the side of the barn. Let's go on the other side over here. You know me (chuckles), bravery test, here we go. Bigger tree, big ol' tree. I like these evergreens. They're so much fun to make. And they're very simple, very, very simple. Takes a little practice
like anything else, everything in your life
takes a little practice. But you can learn to paint this technique faster than any painting
technique that I have ever seen. And I think I've tried
just about all of them. There. And oils... are so forgiving. And they possess a richness
that no other medium possesses. I think that's why the old masters painted mostly in oils. They just have a, a richness. Other mediums to me are
very flat when they're dry. There. And they're harder. This is the easiest, because it's very forgiving, you can't make a mistake here. All right, let's take, let's take some of that
nice grey color we had. Maybe right in here, maybe there's a little, maybe there's a little path
that just works its way out. Just works its way out here. Something about like that. We just put some grey in there so, (makes swooshing noise) can come right on, right on out. Now then. Put some highlights on
our little evergreens. Let me clean off another spot. Running outta room today. Running outta room. There we go. Now, I'll take... liquid white, titanium white, and phthalo blue. I change the blue, I've
been using Prussian blue... through the entire painting,
now I want to use phthalo blue, because I want to highlight these trees and the phthalo blue will stand out a little bit. Just want it to, to stand out. This is a blue spruce,
I just made a decision. Command level decision, right here. See? You decide what kind of
tree lives in your world. All right. Mix up a little more of
that phthalo blue and white. Don't want to have that little, don't want to have that little
tree left out right there. Hey, you have to decide which
tree is in the foreground. I think the small one here is. So you do the one behind him first. How's that? See? And (mumbles) little tree over here. Don't forget him, he'll get sad. He'll get sad. We'll give him a little color on here. There we are. See? That easy. That easy. M'kay. Let's try here, little bit of titanium white. Allow it to pick up some of that color, allow it to pick it up intentionally. So that way, you get all these
different things happening. There. OK. Isn't this neat? These whole winter
scenes are a lot of fun, and I really think they might
be the easiest ones to do. There we are. And we just blend that a little bit till it looks nice and soft and... pretty. And this little tree over here. I'm intentionally grabbing
some of that dark color. See? We'll put him up
on a little hill, sorta. That easy. See? He sorta sits up high. Isn't that neat? That just by pulling some of that color that you can create that illusion? It's unbelievable to
have this kind of power. Unbelievable. There we go. All right, see the little path? It's coming right along there, maybe. (makes swooshing noise) There we go. You just decide where your little path is. There we are. And you can take your fan brush
that has the grey on it... and just polish the edges up a little bit, however you want them. We can just go back and forth, work this until it, until it gets just what
we consider perfect. And sometimes it's nice to, we'll just pop in a little (mumbles) here, then lift up. Lift it up. Make it look like little bushes and weeds living there. Maybe there's one coming right here, I don't know. You decide. You decide where they are. But you have little patches
of bushes and sticks, and wigs. Limbs and twigs that grow everywhere. There we go. See? All right. We'll just use that same brush. Ready to get crazy? Let's take some van dyke brown , mostly van dyke brown,
there's a little black on the brush, I think. It doesn't matter. In our world, in our world. You ready for your bravery test? OK, here it comes. (makes swooshing noises) There. OK, let's give him a friend. Let's give him a friend. (makes zooming noises) There. Something about like it. Or, maybe, maybe this is an old birch
tree that lives out here. It's up to you. You could make him a birch or whatever. You can have an old oak
tree if you wanted to. Doesn't matter. There. Something like so. There we are. You know, it's hard to believe, this is the 31st series
of The Joy of Painting. Good gosh, there's over 400 shows now, it's almost unreal. Almost. I want to thank you for... allowing us to come to you for this long. We've been doing this show now for well over 11 years. 11 years, and you've made me feel very special to invite me into your home and to let me be part of your family. Thank you very much. If you hadn't get to see
all the shows in your area and you would like to, give your station a call, they're available to them. They're available to them. Or if you want to see
some of them over again, let them know. It's the only way they'd know. Little brown with paint thinner here, and just gonna put on some little limbs. It's too cold for there
to be any leaves on here. They went, they went to Florida for the winter. No, leaves don't go to Florida,
they just fall off the tree, I know, somebody'll write and
tell me they're not there. Hmm. There we go. Anywhere you want them to be. Anywhere. Just paint thinner, and off you go. There, see? And don't worry about what's behind it. When you, when you paint it, just paint, don't worry about it. Nature didn't worry, you don't worry. OK, few more little limbs here. Shoot, I think we're about, about to the point where
we got this rascal... looking pretty good. Maybe, maybe there's a little stick
right in there, I dunno. Hmm. Maybe, let's go right over in here. Maybe over in here we can put the indication of just... a few little twigs and
sticks and things that are living everywhere. Something about that that. Shoot, I think with that we
gone have a finished painting. Let's take a little red, and we'll sign this rascal. Really hope you've enjoyed
this little painting, I hope you'll try it. It'll give you a lot of
experience using the equipment, and with experience comes confidence, and with confidence, you know you can do anything that you believe you can do. From all of us here until next time, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless my friend. (mellow music)
