(jazz music) - Well, hello, here we are again, ready to do a fantastic painting together. I thought today we'd do
something that's very soft and deep in the woods and a
very warm little painting. So very quickly here,
I'm going to have them flash the colors across the screen, so in case you didn't get
them on the first show, you'll know all the colors
that we're using here. And this is a fantastic little painting. It's very soft, very quiet, it's like you're walking into the woods. So let's do it. I'm going to start out with
a little bit of Thalo Blue, just a tiny bit and put a
little bit of Van Dyke Brown with it, just to dull it a little. And let's start right up here. And we'll start with
our little X patterns, little criss-cross strokes and we'll put a happy
little sky in here, there. Just let this pick up the magic white and as you work down, it gets
lighter and lighter in value. And we'll just blend
that right out like so. Isn't it fantastic that you
can make a sky that quick? Alright. Now then, without washing the brush, I'm going to go right in
to some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber and a
little bit of sap green, just mix them on the brush,
let them mix on the brush. And let's figure out
where we'd like to have some beautiful little
trees and stuff here. Just push, bend the bristles. And all we're looking for here,
basically what we're doing is the back of the tree and
then we'll put the trunks and limbs in and that will
be the middle of the tree and then we'll do the front of the tree. And maybe there's one
that lives right here. Just let your imagination
sort of go crazy here. Think about where you would want a tree. This is your creation. There we go. Maybe over in here we'll have
some big things happening. Big trees. You're really pushing this
paint into the canvas. Leave some of the airy spots open, don't cover the whole canvas. When the picture is finished, you can see a little bit
of sky through there. OK, now, right up in here,
I want it to be quite dark. I'm going to add just a tiny
amount of Prussian Blue, just to darken this. There we go, I want to create
some deep shadows in there. OK, maybe a little touch over here. Alright. OK, now. Let's take a fan brush
here and make some trunks. I'm going to use a little
bit of Van Dyke Brown. And one side of the fan brush,
I'm just going to touch it to a little tiny bit of white,
so it's only on one side. Now, just pull this down. And we'll make some
little trunks back here. Van Dyke Brown with a
little touch of white. There. You'll probably have to reload your fan brush after each stroke. We just want this to look like little tree trunks that are way back in the distance. Maybe there's another one
that lives right there. But by adding a little
touch of white on there, you can put a little highlight on there at the same time you're
putting your trunks in. It all happens automatically. OK. We've got a lot of little
limbs to do in this painting, so I think I'll cheat
just a little bit here. We'll take and just make a
lot of little limbs here. Maybe there's some up
here in this little tree. There we go. Maybe there's some over here in these. Just here. OK, now, with a large brush. And I'm still using the same dirty brush. I'm going to go right into a
little bit of the magic white, to make a little thinner paint
and right into some yellow. And load a lot of paint into the bristles. And we'll take a little
bit of the sap green. Load a lot of paint into the
bristles, really fill them up. Maybe we'll begin applying some happy little leaves out here,
and we're just gonna touch, just let these little
leaves jump off the brush. There we go, look at there. All of those little son of a guns. Now, if you have trouble
getting the paint to stick, add a little more of the magic white. Remember, a thin paint will
stick to a thick paint. There we are, we'll just put little leaves everywhere out here. And the dark just becomes the shadow. Right in here, a few. Here's another happy little bush, let's try a little bit of
Yellow Ochre on this one. There we are. OK, now I'm just going back and forth here between Ochre and yellow. We'll just put some happy little
things all up through here. There. All kinds of little leaves, just happy. And I'll add a little more sap green now. I want things to be a little darker for what I'm fixing to do now. We'll go right back
here in the background. Just lay a few of these on it. We want these to be
nice and loose and airy. There they go. Isn't that fantastic that
you can put all these leaves and all these little things
happening in the trees in just a matter of minutes? And if you're painting
along with us at home, right now you should begin being quite happy about what's happening here. OK, now then. Let's take a little more
of the Van Dyke Brown and begin figuring out what
we're gonna build here. Just sort of let this happen. This is just straight Van Dyke Brown. Maybe we'll have some land back in here. And maybe there's some
over here somewhere. This is your world. So create land or bushes
or trees or whatever, wherever you want them. Now, we'll take a clean brush
and grab the bottom here and pull straight down, just pull it down. But it's important that
it comes straight down, you don't want to do this an an angle. There. And if you don't get quite enough color, you can add a little bit
to your brush, there, and just pull it down. Now, very gently go across,
just to give it a watery feel. It's very easy to destroy all these nice little lines that you have in there. I think we'll take a one inch brush, put a little bit of magic white on it, and I'll go into Cad
Yellow and Yellow Ochre, just sort of mix them
together on the brush. And we'll slip back in here and put some happy little bushes growing right in here. There's one. All kinds of little leaves
and things happening. There we go. I thought today we'd use a fan brush some. Fan brush can be your best friend. And we'll still use the same colors. And we'll begin working
down the hill here. Automatically, your brush is picking up this dark color, this underneath. You want this back here to be very subdued, very quiet, soft. In the shadows. We'll take a little bit of the white, mixed with a little
tiny bit of Brunt Umber. Just put a few little highlights here. Maybe there's a little sunlight
hitting right along in here. There we go. We'll give him just a little touch. We'll take our fan brush and
begin building all these little soft, grassy areas back in there. Very soft. Alright. Already we're beginning to create a very quiet little puddle
somewhere out in the woods. Now, a little bit of magic white. And we'll mix a little touch
of Van Dyke brown with it, just to dull it down some,
don't want it to be too bright. And we'll begin putting some
little water lines in here. There. OK. Maybe we'll bring this a
little bit more forward, maybe right like that. Make another little projection out there. But each time you add one
of these little projections, give him some reflections by just pulling a little bit of the color down. OK and we'll put a tiny
bit of highlight on there. Use our almighty fan brush. I'm going to add a touch of magic white, just to thin it a little
bit, a little more sap green, want it to start getting a little darker as it's getting closer to us here. There. And let this go with the lay of the land. Always follow the lay of the land. Maybe a little green
over on this side too. Maybe we can bring out another little projection here if we wanted to. Again though, after you bring
your little projection out, he needs his own personal
little reflection. OK, now we can lay just a tiny
bit of highlight on there. Just to make it look like dirt and stone and all the little things
that happen in the woods. And let's take just a tiny
bit here of Yellow Ochre and I put a little bit of
Alizarin Crimson with it. There, look at that. Just let this sort of disappear back here. Just to give an indication
of something there. But it's really very quiet, subdued. I think it's time built an almighty tree. I'm going to mix Burnt Umber
and Van Dyke Brown together and let's put a couple of beautiful big birch trees right up through here. There they go. We'll put the dark on first. Just straight Van Dyke
Brown and Brunt Umber. Just let it come right off your knife. And just to keep him
from getting lonely here, we'll give him another friend. And just mix these two browns together, but don't over mix them, just put them together
and leave them alone so when you put the highlight over here, it'll pick up both colors, there. OK, now, let's take a little
bit of Titanium White. I think we'll make these
trees really stand out. Touch, pull it around, around. Around, just give it
a little pop, like so. Oh, look at that, look at all that bark. OK. These trees need a few
little limbs on them too. The bigger ones here we'll
just do with the knife. There we go. We'll put one over here. And maybe there's one here. We'll take a little more of the white and put a little highlight on the limbs. There. Now then, let's add a few
little delicate limbs out here. Just here and there. Just to give all these nice little leaves something to hang on. And maybe there's one that
comes right down through here. OK. Now, I'm still using the
same ole' dirty brush that I've used all the way
through here without washing. I'm going to add a
little more magic white, because we want this paint to be thinner. Take a little bit of
crimson, ah, look at there. We're gonna make sort of a
bright little color here. And now we'll just lay
some leaves out here. Just let them float
around, very quiet, soft. And don't kill all your
background with them. Leave them loose and airy. Look at that. Just let them play and have fun. Put some up in here. Let your imagination be your guide now, just wherever you think they should be. I think sometimes we work
too hard at painting. Painting should always be
fun, should make you happy. That's when you're truly an artist. For so many years, painting had got to where it wasn't fun
anymore, it became work. Until I had the opportunity
to study with Bill and learn this fantastic technique. And he made it fun again for me. A little water line under here. This is just the magic
white with a tiny bit of Van Dyke Brown in to dull it. Some of these little things just happen. You know, when we do these paintings, we have a general idea of
what we're going to do, but other than that
they're really not planned. We learn to work with what happens. And when you're at home, don't worry about following exactly what we have here. Let things happen and use what happens and create your own masterpieces. Don't just try to copy what we're doing and you can do it. Let's get brave. (imitates plane engines) How's that? We'll just put some brown in here. This is Van Dyke Brown with
a little bit of Umber in it. Really push this into the canvas. All we're looking for
here is a nice dark value. Just really push it into the material. There we go. You know, the colors that we have here, if you're using a
different brand of paint, you'll find slight variations,
but that's alright. Once again, this is your world, so whatever color you want. We're really just trying
to show you the technique. The big thing you're looking for though is the paint is very firm. We get so many cards
and letters from people who have run into problems and
normally that's what it is. The paint is too thin. In some techniques, you
need a very thin paint. In this you need something
that's very strong. OK, let's go back to
the old fan brush here and we'll take some yellow
and I'm just beginning to have a mixture of color down here, it's really hard to tell
you exactly what it is. It's yellow, Yellow Ochre, a
little bit of Crimson in it. It's whatever comes together. Let's begin laying some little
grassy areas on top of this. Now, you're fan brush is beginning to pick up all the dark browns here. You don't want to kill
all the dark browns. You'll lose this beautiful darkness in front of the painting. Let's take a little tiny
bit of Prussian Blue and white and a little brown, there. Let's just give the indication there's some little stones or something here. Just sort of lay them in randomly. We'll cover up whatever we don't want. There we go. Now begin bringing your grassy
areas right on down here. Leaving some of these little
things you just made showing. Don't cover them all up. There. Alright, now we're beginning
to have something here. Now, if you practice this little painting, it's something you can
do very very quickly. It's very effective, very nice and warm. It's a super little painting to give to a relative or a friend as a gift. Because everybody likes
these type of paintings. There we go. And also, you know, if you're interested, it'll put a happy buck in your pocket if you want to sell a
painting once in a while. Of course we're not interested in those monetary gains, I know. OK, and we just begin
filling all this in here. Right down through here. Isn't that something? I like these little paintings. A little dark up in here. I wanna just increase the amount of dark right back here so the shadows are deeper. OK, now, with the knife,
just a clean knife, I'm going to scrape a few
little trunks here and there, little stems, just here and there. Not too many. OK, here I want a little color. So I've put a little brown on the knife. There we go. OK, now we need to... These little birch trees here
need something on their foots. They're sort of ragged hanging out here. So let's just put some color right underneath it so it just ends the tree. And then a little shadow behind it. Gotta have a little shadow here. Like so. All these little things
happening back in the woods. OK, now we can put a few
little stems here and there. I'm using just the liner brush with a little bit of the Van Dyke Brown. And a thin oil on the
brush, just a nice thin oil, bring that brush to a very sharp point. And we can add in a few more
little things here and there. It's just to create a little
more distance in here. Like so. Maybe there's an old
limb that's hanging here. There he is. Put him some little arms out here. There we go. He sort of a fell over,
he's a little tired. Just here and there with these. You always have all these little sticks and stuff out here in the woods. OK, now... Maybe, maybe we want to
get a little bit crazy. And we take the almighty pallet knife here and let's do this. And just lay in a little tree,
right here in the foreground. There he is. OK. Almighty tree. Then I'll take just a tiny
bit of the crimson here and just highlight this side. Just a little bit, just
to sparkle him a little. And maybe there's a little
reflected light over here, I'll use just a tiny bit of blue. Just to show indication
of reflected light. And then back to the brown and we'll build him up, make it thick and when this thing dries, you can feel the bark on this tree and all I'm doing is touching and pulling, touching and pulling. And let's give him a, let's
give him a little arm here. There we go. Lots of little branches
going every which way. There. We need a little more of
the crimson underneath here, just to show a little light. And we're sort of filling in
the top of this composition. Just filling it in, leaving
the bottom part open. OK, let's put some happy little
leaves on here real quick. I'll use some more of the magic white and a little bit of yellow And we'll just put some indications. Most of these leaves are off the canvas. But just a few here and there, like so. Just to give the impression that there's leaves going all the way over. And I think that pretty well
gives us a little painting that we can be very happy with. Put a little grass right down in here. And I think we're ready to
sign this almighty painting. So I use a little bit of the
red and a little thin oil, and let's drop a little
signature on here, OK? Next week, we'll be doing a black canvas, so have your canvas ready. You can purchase one
at your local art store or paint your own with
a flat black acrylic. Until then, from all of
us here, happy painting. (soft jazz music)
