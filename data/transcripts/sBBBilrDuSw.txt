- Hi, I'm certainly glad
you could join me today. Today I thought we'd do just
a fantastic little seascape, and just have a super time
together. So I'll tell you what, let's
start out and have them run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint this
little seascape with me. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've
already done. Standard old 18 by 24 inch
double primed pre-stretched canvas. And I coated the bottom of
it here with Black Gesso, and allowed that to dry
completely. Then I just put a little piece
of masking tape across here. The masking tape is only to
keep the horizon line straight. Underneath here I've covered
this with a mixture of Sap Green and Van Dyke
Brown mixed about half way, little bit of Indian Yellow, and right here in the
corner a little Dark Sienna. Now these colors are
all transparent enough, this still looks black. The top of this, I sort of put
in a little basic cloud shape I wanna big cloud here, with
Black Gesso, and the we just covered
this with a thin even coat of the liquid white. So it's all wet and ready to
go, so let's have some fun. Let's start out today with a
little touch of the Yellow Ochre, very
small amount is all we need on the two inch brush. Just a tiny little bit,
maybe we'll add a little of the Cad Yellow to it, there. Just mix those two sort of
together. And let's go right up
here, and just lay in a little bit of this yellow, right across here. Just using little crisscross
strokes. There. Something about like so. Then we'll go back into a
little more of the Yellow Ochre, and lay that right in there. Little touch more, didn't
get quite enough there. Then we'll just let that
one blend right on down. This is just Yellow Ochre, and
a little bit of Cad Yellow. That's all we have here. Right in the bottom. Help me just do a beautiful,
beautiful sky today. We'll spend most of our
time working on the sky. Then we'll put a little
seascape down in here. Okay, maybe the least little
touch, least little touch, of a little bit of the Alizarin
Crimson, right along there. So we're just sort of playing
with nice warm colors. There we go. Okay, blend that all together. Let me clean the old brush. Just wash your brush
with odorless thinner. Shake it off. (laughs) Then just cover
everybody in the studio. Alright, let's make us
a nice lavender color. For that we'll take some
Alizarin
Crimson, and Phthalo Blue. Crimson and Blue. Okay, a little more blue. I want this sort of to
the blueish side today. And depending on your mood, you may want it to the red
side or to the blue side. Take a little white, check
it out and see what we have. That's not bad, that's a good
color. Okay, let's clean off the old
knife. Today let's use the fan brush. We'll take a fan brush, add a
little bit of this lavender color onto it
we made. Just like so. And let's just go up in here, and using little, I'm gonna
exaggerate, little rocking strokes like
that. Let's just begin putting
in some very basic little, little cloud formations here. There we go. And I use this lavender color,
mainly, so in case it touches some of
this yellow, it won't turn a bright green on
us. Green skies are alright, I
guess, but that's not what
we're looking for today. There we go. Today we're looking for
just a nice beautiful sky, we don't want it to be green. Okay, maybe this runs
right up in here, wherever. Just be very loose with
this, and just throw it in. I've got the Black Gesso
underneath this, only so that dark shows through. It really helps make this a lot
easier. Maybe this comes right over, maybe a little stringy thing it
goes right up through here somewhere. All we're doing is laying
on some base color. That's a mean looking
sky already isn't it. Now then, while I have that
little bit of lavender on here, let's go right in here, and
maybe just put the indication of a happy little cloud or
two, that's just sort of floating around and having a
good time. Wherever you think they would
live. Just sort of pull them out
there. Maybe I'm gonna add a little
more of the crimson to that. And right on down in here,
maybe right at the water line, maybe there's a nice cloud
that's living right here. There. Just sort of make up
little stories, and little, little things like that
and let your imagination sort of just take you
everywhere. There it goes. Maybe it comes all the
way over, who cares. Then it turns around and comes
back, see. But you can do anything in here. Any old thing that you want to
do. Maybe, maybe right up in here
we have a nice bright area. We can put that in too, take a little white, and
just begin working it. In fact, maybe it's right here. There, just let that work right
on out. This is just straight Titanium
White. There we go. You could even go so
far as take your finger, with a little white on it,
and make the indication of a little sun in there if you
wanted to. You can do that. There, and very gently just
blend over it. And the indication will still be
there, and that white that
you put on then becomes the bright area around it. There. There we can just blend
these little clouds, and we can blend those right
into the sky. That easy. In fact, tell you what,
let's have a little cloud, comes right around like this, maybe he just floats around in
the sky, maybe he comes right on down
here. We don't know where he
goes, wherever you want him, that's where he should be. There. Then take our big brush, and
just blend. Alright. I have several old fan brushes
going so I don't have to spend
all my time washing brushes. I'm gonna take a little
white on the fan brush here. Okay, let's go back up here. Maybe there's a little
highlight that lives right here on this cloud. Don't want a great deal, just
enough to make it stand out a little. There, a little over here. See, there's your light
source, so wherever you think light would hit it, just make that decision and drop
it in. Just drop it in. Maybe there's a little
up here on top of this. Wherever. Wherever. There. Now when you're doing
this at home you can put a lot more detain into it, you
have unlimited amounts of time. Here if I go over 30 minutes, this mean old director gets all
over me. But at home you can do it any
way that you want to do it. Now we can fluff that
up, blend it a little. And it makes quite a nice sky
down here. Now then, let's go back
into our fan brush. And lets go up in here, and let's just begin picking
out some little shapes and things that are happening. All we're gonna do is just
bounce a little highlight here and there, just bounce it
in. Then we'll come back and
blend it a little bit. There. We're really working that
paint right into the fabric. Okay. Maybe a little right over in
here. Let me add a little crimson into
my white, a little Alizarin Crimson to
brighten it up just a tiny bit. There. See we can put all kinds of
little things for the light zinging through
there. There we go. In between some of these maybe there's even a
little bit of Phthalo Blue. There. (mumbles) Then we can take a clean
dry two inch brush. And this is where we can
blend all of this together. Just using the corner of the
brush. And lift it, blend it, and very lightly, very lightly just work it all together. There. But work with each individual
cloud, make friends with it. Begin to see things happening in
it. Then you can create some of the
most beautiful illusions imaginable. There we go. Some little highlights up
in here zinging around. There, some little things in
here, just drop them in, just drop
them in, then blend them, bring them
together. There we are. Clean dry two inch brush, and just very gently
bring all this together. See there? Fluff it, blend it. There we go. You can make some unbelievable
skies, very simply, all you have to do is just practice a little bit. And you wouldn't believe
what you could make. Would not believe. Alright, maybe somewhere up in
here even, there we go. Just put all these things in,
I see another one right here. Wherever you want them. Just sort of look around
it and make big decisions where you think they should
live. There we are, that one runs
right along. Right along the top up there. We don't even know where it
goes, we don't care where it goes. It's up here somewhere though. Way up here in the sky. There's something over in here, Wherever you think they should
live. Okay, back to our clean
dry two inch brush. And very gently just blend. There we go. There. Yeah I talk about this mean
old director all the time, we want to put a picture
of her in the newsletter so you can see what she looks
like. There. Okay. Alright. Now you can continue to work
with this, and just create all kinds
of beautiful things. Just work with it. Keep building, but kill
all your dark areas, it's very easy to get carried
away, kill all the dark areas. Those dark areas are what
give it depth and strength. Make it look big, and powerful. There we go. Okay, we don't want to
spend the whole show working on the sky so I'll, move on down here a little bit. Because I love to play with
skies and I could spend the rest of the
day here. Not just the show, but the
rest of the whole day here. Because I think this is
really a great deal of fun. Alright. Now, as I mentioned when we
started, I have a piece of masking tape
right here. The masking tape is only to
keep the horizon straight. So we'll take that off. But now underneath that tape of
course, There's none of the color
that we put up there. Because the tape wouldn't stick
to that. So we'll take a little Van
Dyke Brown, a little Sap Green. And I'll just run right in here. And we'll just lay on
a little bit of color. Right up to the horizon line. There we are, okay. We're in business. Now then, what I would recommend when you're doing a seascape, first of all, we'll just
take the old filbert brush. Let's lay out our major wave
here, that'll make everything much
easier if you have that laid out. And so, let's say it's gonna
come up here. Maybe it's gonna crash over and
go (imitates wave breaking) right in here somewhere, and
it'll come out like this. Then all your waves back here
will, they will spread out like a fan. Just like a fan, okay? Now then, clean off the old brush here. Wipe it down, this filbert brush
we just, clean with paint thinner
and then wipe it off. Grab my fan brush, we'll
take a little bit of the Titanium White, let's go right
back here and decide where our waves
behind the major waves are gonna live. Maybe they're right here. All you have to do is sort of
block it in. Just about like so. Maybe put the indication back
here of, another one. Okay, then we'll wipe all the
excess paint off our brush. And very gently grab that, and begin working it back, back,
back. See? And that light becomes the
trough, or the area in between the
waves. Then we'll just sort of
let these blend back. A little more white and we can
go back here to the horizon. Begin adding in all kinds
of little distant things. We just want indications way
back here. It'll pick up that Sap
Green that's underneath and automatically that'll
jump right out at you. Maybe this wave's gonna come
right down through here, and then, let me wipe off that
excess, then we'll blend that back. Very lightly, very very lightly. Don't wanna lose that
dark area right there, that little dark area right
there is very important to us. That's our friend and we
want to take care of it. Now the fun part of any
wave is this eye right here, or the transparency. So let's take a little
bit of the Titanium White, least least little touch
of the Cad Yellow in it, and we'll use the old filbert
brush. Load the color into it
and let's go up here. Decide where this
transparency is gonna live. Or the eye of the wave. And just really scrub this
color in, scrub it right in. And you can do this as
many times as you want. To achieve the desired
lightness. There we go. Okay now we'll take a clean,
dry two inch brush and just use the top corner, and
very gently, just sort of wind it up. The brush is hardly moving. It just sort of stays
in one place and goes around and around and that'll
blend all that together. And it'll get just as smooth as
silk. Just as smooth as it can be. We just let that run right
on out 'til it disappears. Now we can begin thinking about
the shape, and blend. There we go. And already we begin having the general outline of our wave
there. Okay, I'm gonna clean
up some brushes here. Wash this old filbert brush off. Be sure it's dry. Okay, now then, I have
several fan brushes going. So, let's take a little
of the Titanium White, put it on the fan brush. And let's make this wave curve
over. Maybe it comes right here goes (imitates wave breaking) gotta make those little noises. And have it just curve right
over. Maybe it curves to right there,
we don't know where it goes. Don't know that we really care. Just bring it right over, there
we go. Now, back to our filbert. We'll use a little of this, oh we can use a little lavender
color, it doesn't matter, what the
heck. And let's go in here, and just put in some shadow indications
for foam. This is just basically the
lavender color. And maybe it comes right
on up, there it is. Just like so, there. And right on around, there
is a nice splash, churn, (imitates wave breaking) wherever you want it. Wherever you want it, there we
go. Okay, wash off the old brush. Dry it off, and we'll go
right into a little bit of that Titanium White, you could even put the least
little bit of that purple into it, just to
give it a little lavender hue, but not
much. Okay, maybe let's go right in
here. Now let's put a little
highlight on this foam. Push very hard, make it
just jump right off there. There, little more color. Same over here, we're
gonna have all these nice splashes and crashes. When your color gets
contaminated, just wipe your brush off real
good, and go back into it, there. We'll have a nice crashing up in
here. Wherever you think it should be. Just sort of look at it and
figure out where it should go. There. Comes right on down in there. Now then, back to our large
brush. But be sure it's dry, if it's
not dry, you're gonna mix this all up
into mud and you're gonna be very upset
with me. Just using the top bristles, and I find the two inch brush works better than the one inch, but you might wanna try the one
inch. A lot of people seem to like it
better, I just prefer the two
inch, there's more hair that's actually touching the
canvas than with the one inch. There we go. (mumbles) That easy. Keep your brush clean, and dry. Alright. And then we can take our liner
brush, liner brush, liner brush. We'll take some of the white, this is just Titanium
White with paint thinner. And we can go right along
here and we can begin highlighting some of these
little things right in here. (imitates wave breaking) See now. There we go. And here's our light source, so that's where we want
this to be the lightest. And we can come right back in
here, just begin dropping in some
little highlights and stuff. There. Then we'll start adding a
little lavender here and there as I work away from that light
area, so it won't be quite as bright. I wanna retain that brightness. Then we can begin just putting
in all kinds of little things. There, see. And the more of these little
details that you put in, the better your particular
painting will look. And that'll make you happy, when they look good like that. There we go. Maybe back in here, let
some of these go back. There. And these little lines
create shape and form. And back in here there's a few. This gives your wave roundness
and shows foam patterns and stuff that are
working all up in here and playing. But this is where it all comes
together. All these little things,
little happy things here. Then you can take a little
of the darker color, and come right around here, put a little line under there. And that'll act as your
separator. See, bring it right in there. Just like so. Now maybe, let's have a
little shimmer on the water, shoot, let's have some fun. Take a little Titanium White, There's our light source. Let's just pull this right down. Straight down, right there. All we're using is a
little Titanium White, but all those beautiful
colors are underneath here. This is the Indian Yellow
and the Dark Sienna, and it's all coming alive now. You don't hardly even know it's
there until you start putting
a little white on there. And then, kaboom, jumps right
out at you. There we go. Wherever you want them. Sort of look at where
your light source is, now, very lightly, we go across. And that'll give the indication, of very wet areas. So blend it together, there we go. See how that just comes right
together? Sneaky. Now let's take the small knife, I like a little knife for this, and we'll take a little bit of
the white, Titanium White. Now, come right down in here,
so we can watch right in here. See where this is gonna come? Push very firmly, very firmly. Re-load the knife. Just that little roll of
paint causes that though. See there, there we go. This little knife really
works better for this than the big knife, really works
better. Put a few little things in here. See how you can make all those
little ripples and stuff? There we go. Wherever you think they should
be. Then we can take a fan brush, and very lightly grab
that and blend it back. See, and leave some of those
shiny things showing through, it looks like wetter it is
there. Beautiful, very pretty. We get all of our foam that's
travelling up the wave. There we go, Okay. Now then, back to our little
liner brush. And maybe here there's some, there you go, that's the
last little watery area, goes right there. Like so, Okay, there it is. There. Okay, in here, just all
kinds of little things. Did I say, at home you
have time to do this in a lot of detail, and you'll
be amazed at what an effective way
this is to do some very beautiful seascapes, just
spectacular at times. There we are. And anybody can do them. And I do these kind rather
than just the little, little ones that look like that. Because they're a little more
interesting. There. It's easy to make those just
look like one little wave that sort of fell over. I like to make something
that's got a nice wave going in them and some action,
and, shoot, maybe we'll even
put a rock or two in here, what the heck. I like to put rocks in there, gives a wave something to splash
against, and fun with. Now we got that old brush wet, I'll take a little bit of
the brown, maybe up here, there. Maybe there, we'll put some
little seagulls or M birds, as they're called. There we go. See, there's some happy little
birds floating around up in there. Tell you what, let's have some
fun. Let's take, let's take
that old filbert brush, we'll put some Van Dyke in it. Let me reach over here and get a
little a little bit of the liquid
white. We'll put some Dark Sienna,
a little Yellow Ochre in it. Pile it up. Now then, I'm gonna put Van
Dyke Brown on both sides of the filbert, and then pull
one side, just one side, right
through this light color. Now then, maybe there's some
stones live right out in here. In the water. This is the easiest way I've
ever seen, of making some very
effective little stones. Maybe he's got a little
friend lives there. You know, however many you
want, maybe we'll have three. See, and just let that
highlight come right off there. Take our liner brush, little bit of thin white paint
on it, put a little bottom around these
stones. Shoot, we're about to
have a finished painting. But give this one a try,
and if you have time, drop me a line, let me see what
kind of result you're having because that makes it all
worthwhile if it's working for you, and
I'd love to hear from you. I think we'll call this one
finished. So, give this one a try as I
say, and drop me a line. We take all the pictures
sometime, put them together and we
like to show them on TV, so maybe you'll see yours here. From all of us here, happy painting and God bless my
friend. (jazzy music)
