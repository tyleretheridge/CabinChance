- Hello, I'm glad you
could join me again today. Today, I thought we'd do a black canvas, and this painting will be a lot of fun, I think you'll really enjoy it. I've taken and put a
strip of alizarine crimson right across the center here, and the top and bottom are phthalo blue, and I'm going to have 'em
graphically run all the colors that we'll use today across the screen, and they'll come across in the order I have them on the palettes, starting with the white and going around. And while they're doing that, let's get started and do a fantastic painting together. We'll start with a 2 1/2 inch brush today, go right into some titanium white, and we'll just load some up, get both sides of the
brush loaded up here. We'll just have some fun. Okay, let's go up to the canvas. Now, as I said earlier, there's alizarine crimson
right across here, so, if we hit white here, hopefully, hopefully, there it is. You get a beautiful, beautiful
pink color, reddish color. That's unbelievable isn't it? Just right there, it happens. And then we want to blend that upward. Now, now we're beginning
to get into the blue. See, all these little things
just happen automatically. Our canvases are painted with a flat black acrylic
and allowed to dry. Then, we go back and we put this firm, firm, strong
color on top of it. I'm gonna clean the brush. We clean our brushes with
odorless paint thinner. Shake off the excess, (brush flapping) and then beat it dry. Now, you can do this as
many times as you want and get any desired brightness that you want in these paintings. But, each time you start, start with a clean brush and go back to the lightest area and work outward. You don't want to drag the dirty brush back into the center. The blue is much, much stronger than the crimson, so very easily you can lose all of your crimson color. Right here I'm touching
a little bit of white, and I'm just gonna make
a couple of little spots a little lighter, just
to break up the sky. So it's just not one flat dead color. And then we can clean the brush again. Need to keep a clean brush. Okay, shake it off. (brush flapping) All right. Now then, let's go back in here, and let's just blend out all
the little brush strokes. Very gently, very gently. And that easy, you've got a beautiful,
beautiful, little sky, nice red glow in the horizon. Very exciting. Lot of fun. Okay, and that easy. That's how you get a
beautiful little background. This will work with any transparent color, so play with it. We're just trying to give you ideas, and then we turn you lose on the world. So, play with this, and you can do unbelievable things. Okay, let's begin working
on some background. Maybe, maybe, maybe there's some little foothills back here. I'll just use the same ol' brush. Let's go right into a
little bit of cad yellow. There's some indian yellow,
a little yellow ochre, just sort of work back and forth, pick up a little sap green, put it in there, too. See, and you just tap. There you go, just a little. Quite a bit of paint in the bristles, and work this color back and forth, so you have layers of
different color happening. Let's go to the canvas here. Maybe there's a little footy hill that lives right there. I'm just using the corner of the brush. And we'll just touch, and let it wander right on down, wherever you want it to go. Wherever, wherever, see there? Okay, a little more color. And you can just put as many of these little foothills as you want. Just drop them in. Little distant things happening. Maybe, maybe, maybe, it comes right over,
there it is, there it is. Wherever you want it. Let it go. Okay, isn't that simple? We've got a beautiful
little foothill back here. Now, if you wanted to create a little misty area here, you could take a clean, dry brush, and I've got several brushes going here, and just tap this, just tap it, very lightly. And that darker color that's
underneath will come through. That''s all you got to do,
just tap it, like that, and it'll create a misty look down here. Okay, let's go back in here and get a little more of the color. This is cad yellow, indian yellow, and a little bit of yellow ochre. Okay, go back up here now. And maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe in your world there's a little foothill that lives right there. And maybe this one, maybe it just comes right on across, there it goes. There it goes. Wherever you want it to go. Wherever, wherever. There, and sort of do this in layer, doing the part that's furthest away first, and you don't want to kill
all your dark areas in here. If you kill all the dark areas, then you're gonna lose your depth. It's gonna get very flat on you. So, if you notice it becoming very flat, check to make sure you haven't killed all these dark areas. That's usually what happens. If your paint... If you have trouble
making your paint stick add the least little
amount of paint thinner to your brush and then go into your paint. It'll make it stick. Okay, there we go. Let's bring it right on down. And if you get one that's too bright, you don't like it, if it's too bright, all you got to do is just continually tap it for a little bit. It'll pick up the dark
color that's underneath, and automatically you'll
get darker, darker, darker, until it'll finally
just go away and leave ya. Just go and leave ya. There we go. And that gives us a general little hill back here to play with. Let's go... I want some dark color. Let's make some black. I'll use some phthalo green, alizarine crimson, about equal parts. I want this well mixed, so you pick the paint up off
the palette, turn it over. There. All right. Let me clean my knife off
here, and we'll be ready. And it helps to have some paper towels or something around to
clean your knife on. Okay, we'll get a fan brush, and I want to go right
into this dark color, load a lot of color on, lot of color. Pull it through there,
wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. And then sharpen it. Look at all the color
that's in that brush. That's what you want, a lot of color. Okay, let's go up here. Maybe, maybe, maybe, there's a little... There it is. I knew it was there, a little evergreen that lives right there. Use just the corner of the brush. Just the corner. Work it back and forth. These little evergreens live right here in your fan brush. And you can make them
with a one inch brush, 2 1/2 inch brush. Today, I thought we'd
do 'em with a fan brush. But, whatever you've got handy. Whatever. Maybe, there it is. There's a little one here. Little one right here. Just a little tree, he lives right there. I'll tell you what, I
want another one here. Right there. Okay, maybe, I know there's one on the other side. Let's go on the other side over here. One lives right there,
he's up on the hill. so he looks a little bit
taller, a little higher. See how easy those
little trees are to make? And they're fun. Sometimes, sometimes you get carried away, and you cover up the whole
canvas with just little trees. 'Cause it's exciting to see them just drop right out of your brush there. And maybe there's some little things that grow right down. You need dark against
light, dark against light. Light against dark, continually, continually, play with that. Light against dark, dark against light. That's what makes it work. Maybe like that. There we go, wherever you want it to go. There's little things happening in here. Okay, now we take our big brush again, and we can clean this
bottom up a little bit. See there? Just blend that dark right in. And everything is separate. It separates because
it's dark against light, and it creates the illusion of shadow. Right there. And painting is nothing
but games of illusions. There we go. All right, maybe there's a happy little pond right here. Maybe. Let's just take some of the same color and go right here, decide maybe there's some water lives right there. Now there's blue underneath, and I've got yellow on the brush, so it's gonna change, it's gonna turn a nice green color. Okay, just pull it straight down, straight down, and very
lightly, go across. That quick, instant water. Instant water. Now we take the ol' fan brush here and go right into a little
bit of van dyke brown and some burnt umber, just mix 'em on the brush, little vandyke, little burnt umber, and let's begin putting
some land areas in here. We've got water, we need some land. And here it comes, lives right there. And you need to do these
type of paintings in stages. Do the thing that's furthest
way first, and work forward. So you can put reflections and highlights and shadows and everything at each plain, each stage. Now, I'm gonna take another fan brush. I've got several fan
brushes going here also, and I'll go into some yellow ochre and a little bit of white, white, a little yellow ochre, there. There we go. Turn that brush a little, both sides. Okay, let's go up here. Now, very lightly, just grazing the top, lay in
a little bit of highlight. You don't want to kill
all that nice dark color that you worked so hard to put in there. Don't want to kill all that. If you're gonna kill it,
no use putting it in there. There we go. Just add a little here
and there, wherever. And just let it sort of fade back up into the grassy areas. Ooh, that's pretty. I love these black canvases. Some of the most fantastic things imaginable happen on 'em. Oh, they're just so much fun. There, we're just
bringing it all together. Okay, now, now we can come forward. So, you do this in stages, maybe there's another one
that comes right there. Right there, wherever you want it. And I'm going through the indian yellow and the cad yellow, a little yellow ochre, sap green. Now, there's blue on the canvas so if you keep tapping, any of these yellows will turn a
beautiful green for you. So, you can get all of
the green that you want. You may get too much green
if you're not careful. Don't tap it too much. Now, let's pull some
reflections right under that. Pull straight down, same color. Just straight down. Look at that. Look at that. The phthalo blue under there just absolutely makes some
beautiful reflections. See, you're letting the canvas work. You could do all of
this on a white canvas, no problem, but you would
have to work a lot harder. Now just go across. Now these strokes across, need to be straight across. Need to go straight across,
or your water will look like it's gonna run right
out of the painting. We don't want that. Okay, a little more of the van dyke brown and burnt umber, and we'll put some land here. This is quite repetitious here. This, just quickly get through that. Little yellow ochre and white, we can highlight these a little. Just like so. Just barely touching, barely touching, scrub
a little of that in. Here and there, here and there. There. Okay, let's take the knife, and I'll go right into a
little bit of burnt umber. And we'll go right up here and just lay in some little indications of some waterlines here and there, just using a little bit of burnt umber. And that also cleans the edges up. Makes it very pretty, just wherever you want 'em, there's one. Just where the land and the water meet. Okay, tell you what, let's go to the other side of the canvas, and see what we can make over there. Maybe, it looks like a good place right there. Maybe there's a little pennisula that comes right out through there. See how easy these are though? And just let them go. Let your imagination take you everywhere. There we go. It may be the greatest
gift that an artist has is an imagination, and it's like everything else, practice with it makes
it strong, works better. Use your imagination. Visualize scenes in your in mind, make up them up in your
mind before you paint 'em. Go across. Sometimes, before I ever
do a scene on canvas, I may have painted it a
hundred times in my mind. Every stroke of it, I know every stroke before it ever touches the canvas. It's like, athletes do it. They psych themselves up. They see themself going over
the big jump or the hurdle, and you do the same thing with painting. You see these in your mind. You practice them in your mind. And you come put them on canvas. That's what's fun. A little highlight, still
using the same colors. Okay, and we go back with
a little burnt umber, and drop in just a happy little waterline. Okay, and I can't say it enough though, you do these in stages working the things that's
furthest away first and coming forward. You try to do it all at one time, it looks like it'd be easier, but sometime's it'll get you in trouble. Do a stage at a time, stage at a time, you'll be happier. Maybe, maybe, maybe, there it is. See, just keep building these wherever you want 'em, just a happy little pond sitting out here taking life easy. All right, let it go. Let it go. Just right on out. All kinds of beautiful
little things happening. Picking up that blue that's underneath. Okay, a few reflections. See, each one of these little peninsulas needs reflections or it won't set down into the water right. Don't leave your reflections out. Go across. Okay, back to our brown, burnt umber. Put in a little bit of
land area real quick. Like that. And a little highlight on it. And you're in business again. And you have to make another decision, where does this go? I see it. See, anything you don't
want, you just cut it off. Bring it right on down through there. And you created all these little things for very easily, very easily, and you don't worry about it. You just sort of evaluate
this as you go along, and let things happen,
don't worry about them. Don't worry. Okay, let me just fill this all up. Don't kill all the dark areas. Leave some of these dark
areas here and there. Don't want to lose that
distance and depth in this. There. Darker, darker, darker, if you want it darker,
you just keep tapping. Get darker and darker and darker 'cause it'll pick up that
blue that's underneath. There we go. All right, let's build a
few little trees in here. I'm going to take a little bit of thin oil and go right into my brown, right into the van dyke brown, and let's go right up here, and maybe there's a, maybe, maybe, yeah, you're right, there's a happy little tree. He lives right there. And you can thin this
paint with a thin oil, such as linseed oil, copal, basically any kind of oil. Just to thin the paint. I like oil because it makes the paint slide on the canvas, or you can use paint thinner. Paint thinner will thin the paint. As I said, oil makes the brush slide on the canvas, it's a
little more fun to use. There we go, put a little tree there. Maybe, maybe there's a larger tree, and he lives, he lives right there. This will help build a little distance into the painting, too. Putting a few of these in, just let it go, and if the paint doesn't stick, add a little more oil, a
little more paint thinner. Make it a littler thinner and it'll stick. A little bit of thin oil, and it'll stick. Okay, we'll make this trunk get a little a little stronger, right there. There we go. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe he's got an arm that
comes around right here. You know, trees grow
however makes them happy, and that's the way you ought to paint 'em, however makes you happy. And there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of little limbs, and take your liner brush and very lightly put them in. Just barely touching, pulling, that's how they're done, and you can put in, just oodles of these, and people think you work for months on this painting. Hey, that's when you up the price. There we go. So many painters, for years, painted very rapidly like this, but it was done in secret. They didn't tell ya, 'cause you wouldn't pay $5,000 for a painting that was
done in a half an hour. And we're gonna show you how, and you can make your own creations. There. Maybe a little arm up there. Just let that go right on back. And we can tap right there and that cleans up the bottom. Okay, now then, maybe, we had some evergreens back
here in the background. So maybe, maybe, maybe there's a huge evergreen that lives over here. So, let's go right into some brown, this van dyke brown, load a lot of paint into the brush, just really fill it up. My gosh that brush is full of paint, look at there. Look at that, a lot of paint, right? Let's go up to the canvas here. Maybe there's a big tree, and he lives right here. Now, all I'm doing is just touching, sort of patting the canvas, and then come right on down to where you want him to go. Out here on the side, I
want it to be sort of rough and get all these little hangy downs on the side of the tree. Look at evergreens, why they got all kinds of
little things happening. It's just van dyke brown, and I'm just patting it, right onto the canvas, just pat, pat, pat. I have a good friend named Pat, pat, pat. So, now we'll take a little bit of white, this is just tinanium white, a small amount of burnt umber in it. There we go. There, okay, a lot of paint once again, Let's go back up to the canvas. Now, I want to put this
light color over here. Come right down the side. Just, just tap, tap, tap. Okay, then we can began, where it comes together, just began tapping lightly and blend it all together. See there? That easy you got a nice
light side to your tree. And you can spend a lot of time working yourself to death on this, or you can just do it very easily, there. Put in some of these little hangy downs. And if you get a little
more light than you want, you can take the dark and go back over it, and blend it all together. It's very easy to correct, no problem. You can make some almighty
beautiful trees like this. It's a fun way to make trees. Okay we go back into some brown here. Maybe there's an old limb or two that hangs right down, and all I'm doing is going
straight into the canvas, just touching, just touching, come right down like, there it is, see? Give 'em some little arms and all these little things here. As many as you want, as many as you want. Maybe there's, there he is. I knew there was one there, you did too. There it comes, right on out. Just let it go. There's another one. Wherever you want 'em. Okay, maybe there's one here. I like to make 'em that sort
of wrap around the tree. That always breaks it up and makes it look a
little more interesting than just hanging off both sides. 'Cause that's the way they grow. That's the way they grow. All these little things
happening out here. Now, we can take a
little bit of light color and very lightly, very lightly, highlight some of these. It really pays you to have several fan brushes going, several of every brush going. That way, you don't have
to spend so much time cleaning your brush. Plus, a lot of paint is saved, otherwise, all your
paint, not all your paint, but a lot of your paint ends up just in the bottom of your cleaner can, so if you have several brushes, you can work back and forth, have a brush for light
and a brush for dark, can save a lot of paint. Okay, let's go down here and clean the foots of
this tree up a little bit. I'll just add a little
grass right down in here. There we go. Just very lightly. Pick up a little of that
dark color on my brush. Put a little shadow behind here. There, and while we're doing shadows, let's go back up, right up here, and I wanna add a little
dark area behind this tree to make it look like a little shadow. And the other side of the brush has lighter color on
it, on the other corner, so I'll just go back, see? Isn't that fun? It gives it the impression
of a little bitty shadow. Or we can take the liner brush and you can come back in here and lay all kinds of
beautiful little highlights. All kinds, just blend them in. See, you need a little light here to make that stand out. And that gives you some
ideas to work with. And this is a fantastic little painting. It's very easy to do, and I think you'll enjoy it. It should give you a lot of ideas. So, let's take some thin oil, a little permanent red, and we'll go right up
here and sign this one, call it finished. And once again, I really hope this painting has give you some ideas, set your imagination on fire. Between now and next week, you'll do all kinds of beautiful things. And until then, we'd like to wish you happy painting. God bless. (mellow music)
