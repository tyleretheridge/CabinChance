hey glad you could join me today you ready do a fantastic painting well let's get started okay let's haven't run all the colors across the screens you need to do this painting they'll come across as usual in the same order that I have them on the palette while they're doing that let's go up here and talk a second I've done something a little different today I have my standard Oh 18 by 24 inch canvas up here but I've covered the top with liquid white and the bottom with liquid clear now that's just a clear medium is just like the liquid white only is clear I'm going to do a little seascape data and I want my dark color to stay dark so we put the clear in here so let's get started I'm going to take off with a little bit of Prussian blue a little Prussian blue into that tiniest little bit of black midnight black Prussian blue let's go up here now using the little crisscross strokes I want to just drop in a happy little sky and we'll have some let's have some beautiful clouds in this guy so where this leaves in general shapes where we will put a little cloud there we go there's something like that just happy little sky setting take you bit a second when you're using a big old 2 inch brush now then I'm going to use the same old dirty brush go right into some of the midnight black reach down here and I grabbed a little bit of a bright red so I have midnight black and bright red just mix them on the brush let's go right up here maybe maybe there's a big old cloud and he lives right there we'll put the shadow in first and then we'll come back and we'll drop in some of the shiny stuff some highlights let's start off with a shadow all right tell you what I'm just going to reach over here and grab a one-inch brush go right into titanium white with the least little touch of bright red again little sunshine color load a lot of paint into the bristles let's go right here now then just lay in your basic little cloud shape using tiny tiny little circles see they're just let these little rascals just float around in your world let them float around alright right now there's another happy little cloud and you're painting you put as many or as few clouds as you want there we go I know we'll take a clean dry 2 inch brush and we just sort of stir this up just sort of mix it using tiny little circles with a top corner of the brush tiny little circles like that okay but knock off the excess paint and we'll fluff this cloud just grab it lift it fluff it up hmm not a fantastic way to make a happy little cloud happy big cloud that's a son of a gun all right and maybe maybe in this painting tell you what I'll wash the brush here real quick shake l hm and redecorate the studio maybe in this painting let's have a big mountain we will really have some fun we'll have a mountain made out of black and blue black and blue this is Prussian blue cut us off a little roll of paint kidding let's go right up here now then maybe this old mountain lives oh right up in the clouds here there he goes that's a bumper just make your mountain however you want it maybe this one sort of leans over when he was just a little hill maybe somebody stepped on him pushed him see he's got sort of a bend on him what the heck scrape off all the excess paint just really see there get tough with it you can probably hear how hard I've scraped on canvas there we go now then take a 2 inch brush and very lightly see there just pull it out and let it blend right into the liquid white just like so there we go there we go in that super let us take that steak we'll use some titanium white pull it out very flat and we need that little roll of paint always get that little roll of paint and go right up here and begin laying some highlights no pressure no pressure don't look at that look at that just enough flow together over here grab it soon see how you can make it all melt and just curve right around in there look at that let that paint break no pressure can't see there's enough times there it goes okay take a little edge of the knife we put a little mm right there maybe even some right in there wherever you want to just look at your mountain and decide where you think where you think light would strike we'll take a little bit of a little blue and white and with that we just mix us up a shadow color that's a little bit too bright sup a little black in it that'll dull it there that's much better okay now then begin picking in picking out the shadows here look at that bring it right on through so that all these things just happen right over in here just a little shadow it goes right off in there sort of bring that together see how you can create all those beautiful beautiful effects I know you could do it I knew you could do it all right wherever you want a little thing right in here we need a little to shadow there okay okay clean dry brush all of the angles do I create a misty appearance just tap just following those angles over here to go in this direction there we are clean dry brush lift upward just lift it upward like so okay here follow those angles always follow the angles in your mountain the most most important oh we got a while looking Mountain there already okay now down here we have the liquid clear so let's just add some nice dark color I'm gonna go right into blue this is suppression blue Prussian blue partial blue and let's take some alizarin crimson and add to it so we got Prussian blue and lizard crimson okay let's go ahead up here now you have to make a big decision here where's your water line gonna be I think it should be right there try to keep this fairly straight mmm if you if your water line is not straight your waters will run right off in the floor then you're going to be angry there we go maybe I'll put some more crimson and in it yeah there we go now we have sort of a lavender color mmm that's pretty let's see that key if you had liquid white up there when you did this you would pick up the liquid white and you would lose all your values now then we have to make some decisions let me show you I'll just take a little filbert brush here come right up here we have to decide where where we're going to have this major wave so just take a little filbert and you can just sort of sketch it in maybe it comes right along and here somewhere comes up here and crashes over boom right there she will have another one over here wherever you want in these areas if we're going to have two little crashers that's technical talk to little crashers then we want to have a little light area in there so we want to save that area that's one of the reasons I use that liquid clear is so we can save the transparency at the rest of it we can just fill in with a very dark color just like so that easy okay we're gonna ask Elena now then I'm gonna go into a little touch a fellow green right on the same old dirty brush too much green hair that's better I want some say no don't don't kill that area is gonna be transparent good right up into there we can cover up in here and all we're doing here is just flocking in some color windows looking for a great deal of detail or anything else at this point you'll do that a little bit just layin some color on the canvas that looks like a while nest there already okay let me grab my fan brush now let's begin putting some swells back here I'll just go right into titanium white loaded brush full of paint full of pain okay let's go back up here now then right in here I'm just gonna begin just barely touching the canvas don't kill all the little dark areas just sort of back and forth leaves in the little dark area so and right in here we'll have mmm there we go there's a nice one there's a nice one maybe you're right along in there not on and I'll wipe off the excess paint and very lightly here I'm going to grab this and begin pulling it see just pull it all right look at that see that picks up all that beautiful color we have underneath look at all the little things that are happening that's super you know you could do a seascape that easy they don't have to be hard now come right along this way a little that in and pull it back look at that see that creates the little swells we'll bring it down you could say this is a swell painting now you know why I paint instead of being a comedian there we go thing that blocks all that in force and let's go back to our little number six filbert and I'm going to take titanium white just pick it up with a brush and the least little touch of the CAD yellow titanium white caddy all a load a lot of paint on your brush let's go back up here if your little transparency or your eye is going to be right here and drop it in oh isn't it pretty let it come down and begin picking up some of this color same let it begin picking up some of that green that we put in all right now over here we decided maybe right here there's gonna be another one let me move over a little and that it's gonna come right through there like that like that there alright now we can take a clean two inch brush and we want to just blend this all together so it's very smooth look at there yeah we'll do the other one now and you can be begin creating the shape of this wave just by pulling down with a brush same thing over here same thing and grab another fan brush and I have I have several brushes going so I don't have to stop him and continually clean them we'll take a little that dark color this is blue a little filigree and where this is going to be crashing we'd need some dark in here need a dark in here so our light color will show got to put the dark in so the light will show looky there we were going to have one over here to put that darken all right when you get it okay get that brush all cleaned up and then we can come right along the top of this this is just the old filbert with a little white and yellow on it so with a nice highlight up on top of that you could do that with a fan brush like let's do it with a fan brush see there just smooth it but leave a little bright Ridge on there that's pretty that's pretty okay now then let's take a little titanium white on the fan brush and come right up here and let this crash right over make little noises little sounds hmm look at that too and over here there's some more that easy that easy okay now we'll take some some of this lavender color that's alizarin crimson in the blue mixed together and we'll put a little touch of white in like that good let's go up here now right in here we're gonna have some crash so we got to put the shadow in first want the shadow in first and we'll come back we'll come back and add the nice bright area mmm there it is I think it's really crashing up here we'll just over here we want this one to have a little crash on it - okay put the cash in and then we can go back to our titanium white with a little bit of yellow in it just a small amount and let's come back in here and put some highlights on this push it push it Bend that fresh Janice bend it and all you doing to start with it's just lay you don't we'll come back with a clean brush and smooth it right now just looking to get the ooh there we go get that nice shape just like so okay a little bit over here same idea see my dear then let me clean scrunch up a little bit and want a good and dry this brush needs to be dried to do this I just have a paper towel now I won't just take the brush and rub it just bring all it together see there don't let this get to light only it's almost a natural tendency to want to jump in there and make this all shiny and white it doesn't work well okay now with a clean brush very gently very gently just sort of mix that up a little bit okay give this a little crasher and then we can begin coming in here and begin making a little little foam patterns little plane since you're just traveling right up to wait this is where you shape the wave give him some personality I don't know over here - don't want him left out hey all kinds of little things and in here this is be out of the shadow of the wave so it'll be a little little brighter just move it brighter Oh kinds of little things and then we need something for this a crashing wave to be hitting I like to have stones in there so I'll take a little bend a crown little dark sienna mixed together pull it out get that little roll of paint on the knife need that okay now big stone lives right there right there see there just drop him in and then we'll take some dark sienna so yellow ocher and mix it together through a little a little bit of bright red and there - what the heck cut us off a little piece go ahead up in here no pressure just let this sort of graze that make that quite bright so you can see it we'll all right now we'll bring some water right around his little foots so just bring it all together bring it all together need these little little foamy things in here tell you what let's do I'm going to go right into a touch of dark sienna a little bit of a Van Dyke Brown and let's put some sand right here we have some sands let's get lighter and lighter and lighter lighter and lighter right up to the water maybe the least little touch of alizarin crimson boom oh look at that it damn nice sucker there fantastic and there you could do it and clean the old brush up give it a good shake just beat to death let if I get the biggest kick out of there all right I'm gonna take a little paint thinner go right into this this is phthalo blue and white and let's go up in here and just begin adding a few little details just here in there just I sort of make some of these little things just Sparkle just make them Sparkle then with paint thinner I'm going right into my this is the titanium white with a little touch of cad yellow into it and we just with this but a few little sparklers up here on the water don't get too many or you'll lose their effect just a few you can overdo real easy see I put a few little things coming down the way a man down to here there all right all right yeah then more paint thinner and picked up a little bit of dark color I want to make a little line underneath the edge of my water here just a little line to set it off just to set it off hey Lucas let's gently gently fling that see how that makes it sort of set up with very nice okay tell you what let's grab a whole fan brush here I'm gonna go into some SAP green sample greens have green we'll grab some black and some brown and we just make a big old gookie color here this is green brown black all those good cut a little more brown and telescope here maybe back in here far away there's some little trees that live and we can make the indication of little distant trees just by tapping downward with it with the old fan brush we're not looking for a detail it's too far away when things are far away you don't see a bunch of detail and let that run your hat on out I can't just to give indication trees far far away all right now we can take a 2 inch brush and go right into dark sienna Van Dyke Brown just taps them onto the brush here and maybe underneath these little distant trees there's a little bit of brown comes right down through there sure we might even have some nice cliffs we can just lay them in with a brush and then highlight him it doesn't matter comes right after mmm I met neat Amy there's another one and he lives there just like yeah okay now with another two-inch brush I'm gonna go into yellow ocher and dark sienna just mix them on the brush can you let's go right up in here I just want to tap some nice little highlights right on there make it look like little grassy things we you back I can okay we can take the knife and we confirm these edges up here a little bit look at that you just put as many of them in there as you want come on grab a grab the old fan brush there take some yellow yellow SAP green yellow ocher just mix them together here a lot of paint in the brush go back up here now then maybe there's some little grassy things that go right down these hills I had almost out to the water a lot of nice color just let them come right on out this is where you create the lay of the land see they're all those little things just happen just happen yeah let's put some put some little things see here we're gonna make you sand wet so pull that down go across liner brush and we'll go right into a little bit of blue and white we want this paint to be thin as water can't go back up there now then maybe right along these edges here see we can clean up all those nice little edges and here's a little little Ripple he lives right there yeah it's letting go right on back just all kinds a little ripples on happening like so see there there's many of them ones you want okay tell you what we need a we need a couple of nice trees in there we'll take we'll take some Van Dyke Brown and some SAP green just use the tail one inch brush tree lives right there nice big push he lives right there and we can highlight that we'll use a little yellow lily a little green chance go back up here now we eat some leaves on this little tree don't want him look naked out here put some clothes on him so he really sparkles look at that Dad easy and easy back in here but just take a little white clean up these edges so that all comes together now tell you what this has this has some fun would take Van Dyck Brown will use will use this whole filbert brush and maybe there's a tree hmm you're right he lives right there right there maybe he's got an old arm ah now trees that live out here let's give him a friend trees that live out here boy they catch the devil I mean this is some rough living and we don't give him not a little arm here and there wherever wherever I'll take a little bit of the a little bit of the liquid black dome of talent liner brush and I added paint thinner to it so it's even a little bit thinner and then take and we just put a couple of old old tired arms out here on this like so there see just an old tired arm and with a fan brush I will just use some green and brown let's put a indication of a few leaves out here but not many most of them have already or they got tired and quit just indication this is a rough place to live right here and I think with that we've just about got a finish painting the old clock on the wall tells me I have to leave you for this week but I really hope you've enjoyed this one until next time happy painting god bless you
