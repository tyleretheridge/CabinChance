- Welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today 'cause it's a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you're at. So, tell you what, let's start
out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got done up here. I have my standard old double
primed pre-stretched canvas, and today I'm using an 18 by 24 inch, You use whatever size
is convenient for you, and I've covered the entire canvas with a very, very thin, say that again, thin coat of the liquid white. So the canvas is all wet and
slick and it's ready to go, so tell you what, let's just do a fantastic little painting together. Thought we'd do something
to day that's just fun. We film this show in Muncie, Indiana, so I thought maybe today we'd do a show that has maybe a little
farm-like scene in it that I think will be pretty. So, let's tuck off with
old two inch brush. Let's start with a little Indian Yellow. Let's make a very simple little sky that you can do with no problem. Very, very simple. Just a fun little sky,
little Indian Yellow. See there? And that color is continually mixing with the liquid white
that's on the canvas. All right, without cleaning the brush, I'm just gonna go into a
little bit of Yellow Ochre. It's sort of a gold color. We'll go right above that,
just a little, just a little. About like that, and
just blend them together. Now, then. Now I'm gonna clean the
brush, gonna clean the brush. Yeah, we clean our brush
with odorless paint thinner, shake off the excess, (laughs) and just beat the devil out of it. We have more fun cleaning
the brush, it's just unreal. Let's go right into Midnight Black. Now, I cleaned the brush
in between these colors because if you put yellow
and black together, as you know, it makes green. But I'm gonna take a little black and just gray the sky on top. And if we're real careful, we can bring it right back down into the yellow, right where they join, without ending up with a bright green sky. See, just let them sort
of blend together gently. Like that. There. That's all there is to it. Now, then, we can take
that same old brush, and maybe there's a little
cloud that lives right there. See? See, there he is,
a little stringy cloud. He just sort of hangs out right there. Maybe he's got a little
friend right there. Tell you what, maybe there's
another one over there, I don't know, I don't know. This piece of canvas truly is your world and you have to make these big decisions. Now we'll take a clean
brush, I changed brushes, clean dry brush, three hairs and some air, and very gently just blend that out. And today, that's about all I'm
gonna do for the little sky. I want this just to be very, very simple. Just a very simple little sky. There. That way we can spend
most of our painting time worrying about other things. Let's use a little one inch brush. I'm gonna grab the knife. I want to make some brown. I'll make quite a pile of brown. I'm gonna use it throughout the painting. Take Alizarin Crimson and Sap Green, in about equal parts. Now you can take it to either side, you can take it to the green
side or to the reddish side, depending on your mood or the
effects you want to create. Doesn't matter. It's up to you. You decide. Today, I'm just gonna
have it a nice brown. Okay, we'll wipe the old knife off here. We just wipe the knife
on an old paper towel. We just use a little one inch brush and go right into a little of that brown. Just gonna use it for a
little background color. Maybe I'll put a little
black with it, darken it. There. That's nice. Maybe back in here. Let's just use little Xs, and maybe there's gonna be some little trees that live far away, so I'm not looking for a lot here except basic, very basic, little shapes. See, just sort of scrub them in, we don't care. This is your world and you
can do any old thing here. There, something about like that. Just let it go. I'm gonna add a little
more black down at the base because I want it to be a little darker, indicating there's some
shadows down there. Gotta have a place down here for all my little animals
friends to hide and to relax. There. Okay. Wherever you think they should be. All right. Now, today I'm gonna get the little, this is a little half size round brush, it's a small round brush. Put a little bit of liquid white on it, put a little bit of yellow, be right back, I'm gonna
get a touch of blue, and a little touch of black,
make a nice green here. So we got green, little Yellow Ochre, here and there I'm gonna probably hit the Indian Yellow, maybe even a little Bright Red now and then. And red and green make brown, so I use red as a duller if I
want to dull the green, then that's what I use. Let's go up here. Now, then, just go in here and just
tap in the indication of some beautiful little things that are happening far, far away. See there? And vary the colors a little bit. We don't want a lot of detail. These are supposed to look like little trees that live far away. Add a little bright red to that. Oh, I like that color. I like that. Color makes me excited. So beautiful. There. Probably painted 25,
30,000 paintings in my life and I still get excited
when I see this work so easy and so much fun,
and it brings so much happiness to so many people. That truly, truly is the joy of painting. There. Okay, maybe a little bit
more of that reddish color. This would be a nice scene
to do an autumn colors, where you really get crazy, use a lot of the red and
the crimsons, and oh, just Jack Frost when he
starts touching the trees, just makes some of the most
gorgeous colors in the world. I lived in Alaska for many, many years, and you never talk about
Alaska in the fall, but Alaska has some of the
most gorgeous fall colors of any place I've ever been. I really do think God
was having a good day when He made Alaska. So beautiful. I haven't been there in
a couple of years now. About time to go back. There. Say hello to all my friends there. All right. See now, we've got all
those little tree things back here and it's really easy. Take a liner brush,
just a very small amount of that little brown color that we used. There, see? Just a little. A little bit. Okay, let's go up in here. Now here and there, and there and here, I'm just going to put the indication of a few little trunks and stems and all those things that live in trees. There, see? Don't want a lot, just a few. Don't over do. Okay. All right. We just wash the old liner brush. Shoot, find a brush here
that's not too dirty. We don't care. Go into the brown and the black, little bit of Sap Green, here and there, just to give it a little greenish hue. Okay, let's go up in here. Let's make some big
decisions in our world, maybe there lives some land right here. We're gonna do a little scene. I tell you what, I'm gonna save this whole side over here and put a big tree. (laughs) You know, if you've painted with me before I love these big trees. There, so we'll play with
those today a little bit too. So again the browns and the black. I'm just looking for a dark color so on top of that, then we'll come back and we'll put some nice highlights. Make a little grassy area. This is a good place to practice and just get the feel of the brush. You could actually, you could put this on with a mop. It doesn't matter. But, by doing this, it gives
you practice with a brush, so I suggest you take every opportunity to get the feel of the brush. So much of painting is a feel, and it comes with practice. Boy, if I don't quit, I'm gonna have the whole canvas covered up. But that's okay. That's okay. Look there though, putting these little, all
these different layers in here, just by tapping. Already you can see
distance in the painting. Looks like trees that live
way, way back there somewhere. We don't know where they live. Don't know that we even care. I'm gonna dip the brush into the least little touch of the liquid white. We dip it in the liquid
white only to thin the paint. Be right back, put a little green, little Sap Green. Oh, that's pretty. Sap Green's such a nice color. Okay, tap it and give it a little push so you can see that little
ridge of paint right there. There's one just like that
one the end of the bristles and that's what we're looking for. Let's go up here. Now, then we're gonna
have a nice little field, we just begin coming right in here, and think about the lay of the land, or how the land flows, and we can begin putting in all kinds of
beautiful little grassy areas just go all through all your different yellows and your greens. It's up to you, up to you. I'm just gonna sort of
dance it back and forth, between all the different yellows. Some time a little - oh, look there hit a little Bright Red. Nice little tree. I mean, nice little grassy
area, that's not a tree. Could be. Give it a little fertilizer,
love it, water it regular. Might be a tree there. Tell you what, tell you what. Let's have, we're gonna
have a little scene, maybe we want to have a little... I'm just gonna scrape
out a basic shape here. I'm gonna have a little barn back here. It's just a nice place
to have a little barn. Scrape out a basic shape with a knife just so you have an idea
of where you're going, but more importantly it removes
that loose excess paint. I'll go right into that brown color I made from the brown that was made from the Sap Green and Alizarin Crimson. See? Think about the basic
shape of the old barn. Gotta have a place for
the cow to go at night. He may get scared out here. Might be an old hoot owl
out here that makes noises. When I was a kid, I used to camp out, late at night and the old owl
would make a big old noise. I was ready to call my mother and go home. But as I got older, I had
the opportunity to learn what those creatures were and
why those noises were made. I tell you what, before
this series is over, I'm gonna show you a big old owl. I like owls. I'm gonna show you a great horned owl that I had the pleasure of meeting. I think we had some
video with him on there. I'm just gonna get him up here for you. Take a little Bright Red, a
little of that brown we've made, a little bit of white into
it, don't over mix it. See that color? It's not over mixed. Now we cut our little roll of paint off, all those little designs
are still in the paint. Now we can go up here and just begin putting some color in. I'm gonna make that a little bit brighter, a little more white into
it so it shows up for you. That's better. I'm just gonna let the
knife sort of bounce. I don't want this just to be solid. I like old buildings in my
paintings, but it's up to you. If you want it to look newer, be a little more careful with them. I like it to look about
half of it's blowed away and it's about to fall down. The old farmer that lived out here, he didn't take too good a care of it. He had some bad days. There. See there? Now over here, almost nothing. Almost nothing. Tell you what, we'll get a
little more of that brown. This farmer's like me, he needs more room. Let's give him a shed out here. There. Give him a little shed, put some sides on it. Back to our little roof color. See how easy it is? Wished it was that easy
to actually build a shed. I used to be a carpenter years ago. My father was a carpenter,
and he taught me that trade. And, I tell you what, it isn't that easy to make a shed on a barn. Now, then, we can come right in here, and just do a "barnectomy," sorta figure out where we think everything should live, work on our perspective. See there? Now, we need a door. If we're gonna have old cow
living in there, we need a door. (whistles) There it is. Now Bossy can get in and go out. We can take and make just the indication of a few old boards that
live right along here. There, just by touching. Come across, little bit of
light color on the knife. Let's sorta outline
that door a little bit, so it stands out and we see it better. But that's a pretty good looking
old raggedy barn out there. Now, we're not too
worried about the bottom 'cause we'll come back with our old two inch brush that we've
made the grassy areas with and just sort of fill them in. There. Like that. And when you're painting,
make up little stories. Think about the old
cow that lives in here, or the chickens, or the pig, or whatever lives in this old barn. I stay in so much trouble at home, I probably have to live in there. There. Now, then. Tell you what, we need a little path. We'll take a little of
that brown and white. Let's just put a little path in here. There. Little path, so there's
a way to get in and out. Just a little path. Comes right out. Little highlight on it. Not much, not much, want
to keep it pretty dark. Now maybe in our world, shoot, if we've got a cow here, we need to contain her, somehow. There. Put a little fence right up here. Maybe the fence goes to right about there. Maybe it comes right up here. I don't know. Okay, if our light's
coming from this direction, and the old barn indicates it is, we'll highlight a little bit
on that side of the fence. See there? Just a little highlight. Now you can take just the heel or the back of the knife and
just cut right through there, either direction, and make the indication of some wire on there. It'll scratch through and
just let a little canvas show. We'll put three strands
of wire on our fence. We got a big cow in here and
we don't want her getting out. Sometimes, it's neat,
take a little bit of, I use a little Bright Red, put just a little top
on those little devils, 'cause normally when you cut fence posts, when you cut the tree
down to make a fence post, you paint the ends of it
to keep from deteriorating. There, so we did that. Let's just keep going here. We'll put some more of that brown and black color underneath here. Let's see, so if you're in a big hurry, you can just paint it on. It doesn't make any difference. I usually like to tap it
on, though, because it, once again, gives you a lot
of practice using the brush. But, however, it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. There. Little more black, little more brown. Okay. We said we were gonna
have a big tree over here and we left a big hole (laughs) so we'll have a big tree. We'll take the old two inch brush. There it is. Just use the corner of the brush and tap in some basic shapes. This old tree, maybe
it's a group of trees, let's have a group. A whole big family of
trees live back here. Add a little bit of
Bright Red to that color. Yeah, I like that. And here and there. Leave a couple of holes in your tree so some sky can show through. Let a little light get through. The birds gotta have a
way to fly through there. There. Wherever. And down towards the base,
I'm going more into the black. I want it to get darker, darker
down here, indicate shadows. A lot of shadows. There. Something about like that. Okay. Let's have, let's have a few little
old tree trunks in there. Let me find a little fan brush here. Dip the fan brush into a
little bit of paint thinner, just to wet it up a little. And I'm gonna load it full of this brown, little black on it, then I'm
gonna come right over here and pull one side through
that lighter color, so there is a little
difference in the color. Once side's a little
lighter than the other. I know it's hard to see,
but it is a little lighter. We said our light was
coming from the left, so we want that lighter side on the left, and there's not a whole
big difference in there, but a little. I just want to put the
indication of some little things that live way back in there. We're not too worried
about them, at this point. Take our liner brush,
little paint thinner, little of that brown
color, and here and there, just gonna put the indication
of a few little arms that are on some of these
little trees back in here. There, see? We're not looking for a lot of detail. These are too far back. Maybe if we have time,
here, we'll just put a big old tree in here. I like big old trees. Yeah, we can just use a nice old two inch brush here. Grab a little Sap Green. There. Oh, that's nice. Don't want a lot of color. Just a little. A little red too, I wanna dull it. There, good. Up in here, just use
the corner of the brush, put the indication here and
there, and there and here, of some leaves that live out here. Think about patterns and shapes, though, don't just throw them in at random. I know it gets to be fun,
and it's just tempting just to drop them everywhere. Retain a lot of your dark areas though. It makes them look deeper. There we go. Isn't that a neat way, though, to make a big old pile of trees? So easy. So easy. There. Put a little one right there. Something like that. All right. This truly is a lazy
man's way of painting. That's why I like it. Always look for ways to
make painting easier, but yet effective. There. Because if you have
some success with this, then you really like it, then you go and you paint everything,
and maybe a lot of people that I've talked to,
they've had success with this and they end up in college or something, really studying some fine traditional art because this worked for them. So, that's what's so nice. Back to our brush here that we were using to make some little grassy areas. We'll put in a little, maybe there's a little hill right there. Yeah, yeah there is. See? Any old place you want
him, right along here. All right. I really like him. I'm gonna add the least little touch of paint thinner to my brush, because a thin paint will
stick to a thick paint, so that'll make it come
off the brush easier, because the paint that I have up here, very thick, very strong, very dry. It's not like traditional paints. There, just vary the colors a little bit, just work in layers, that all these little things happen, wherever you want them. Maybe a little bit right there. I like that. Just to push that path a
little farther down in there. Okay, over in here,
there's maybe a little bit. Wherever. Little bit more. There. All right, we said we'll get crazy here. Let's load a fan brush full
of black and that brown that we made from crimson and Sap Green. Are you ready? This is your bravery test, right now. Fan brush is full of color. Big decision. Maybe it starts right here, and maybe this old tree
had some rough days that he's got some crooks. Oh, yeah. I like trees. Trees are a lot of fun. Gorgeous. Lot of fun. Putting on big old foots out here so he has something to stand on. We want him to be strong. We'll give him a big arm here, like that. Gotta make those little noises, or it just doesn't work right. Now, then. Let's see, we had a little bit of brown and white mixed up here already. Just touch it and sorta
let the knife just bounce. Barely touch it, barely. Let's just sort of touch. See? Little bit up in here, barely touch. There, something about like that. That's all that we're looking for. Darker, darker, darker. On the other side, we're gonna take a little bit of the Prussian
Blue, little bit of white. Want to make a dark blue. I want to make the indication of a little reflected light, right there. See, 'cause I think that these trees here would stop the light, so we're gonna get a little light through there. So I've highlighted this one intentionally on the other side 'cause I think those trees
would stop the light. There. There, a little bit of a lighter color just to make that edge stand out. There. You know when you buy
your first tube of paint, you get your artist license issued to you, and the artist license says
on this piece of canvas you can create any and every
illusion that you want. That's what we do. I'm gonna take a little paint thinner and go up in here, and make the indication of some limbs and sticks and stuff that
live right out in here. There, wherever you want them. There. And if you have trouble
making this paint flow, just add more paint thinner to it. Maybe a lot of these old limbs have, maybe they've just pooped out. They're old and tired. Maybe this old tree died. That happens sometimes. That happens. There we go. Don't make all the limbs
just come out the side. Have some come across. All right, now then. Let's take a fan brush,
put some brown on it, and let's just make our
path come right on out, right on out, here it
comes, here it comes. Right on out through the painting so we have a way to get to that old barn. And you can take it and just fill in a few little grassy areas,
bring it all together. Put you a stick and a twig
here and there with the knife. Shoot, we got a finished painting. There. Hope you try this one, 'cause
I think you'll enjoy it and you'll find it to be a lot of fun. And from all of us here, I'd
like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. (jazzy music)
