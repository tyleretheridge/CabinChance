hey welcome back I'm glad you joined me today because they were going to a fantastic little seascape and I think you'll like that let me tell you what I've already done up here I have my standard old canvas appeared now I've covered the top of it with just liquid white just like we normally do then I have a piece of masking tape and this is slightly above the center slightly above Center and then the bottom of this I've covered with liquid clear and I've just have a thin even coat so tell you what let's haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along and we're going up here and get started now let's start today with a small amount of the phthalo blue smallest little amount just a tiny bit okay let's just go up in here and let's just drop us in a happy little sky just a quick little sky now when you're putting this liquid clear all like we have on the bottom use it very very sparingly because you can't see it you have a tendency to put it too much off need very very little of it Oh Sun Oregon one one can of it might last you for years and years and years there we go I have a big old cloud up in the sky so we'll just leave a spot over the fourth okay can we just blend that out a little that like so now say Moe brush thought takes more phthalo blue reach up here and grab a touch of the misery and crimson so we have they love blue and alizarin crimson and just mix it on the brush I'm just looking for sort of a lavender color maybe in our sky today there's a big old cloud just use a corner of the brush see just just tap you know the back of the cloud here putting in some shadow saint-denis drop them down wherever you want baby right on down I don't know you be the judge of where you want clouds to be if it comes right on them in here somewhere hollers to it all we're doing is putting in some dark shape so we put light on it'll stand out and sparkle for ya let's bend this with over a little there see make him tilt over a little bit you just do anything to undo your cloud clean the brush here give him a shake we're in business okay I'm gonna go right into titanium white still use old two-inch brush what the heck now when you're doing this at home maybe you want to use your fan brush to do it if you want very delicate little clouds or a one-inch brush or you can get brave and just use this big Sun we got it doesn't matter there we go just put them Rascals on there won't big fluffy cloud just lives out here has a good time maybe there okay just wherever you think they should be maybe there's a little bit of it did floats right over here wherever wherever look at that see this big ol brush will make beautiful clouds if you just give it a chance but I'm using just the corner of the brush okay we'll wash it rascal again if you painted with me before you know I use odorless thinner to clean the brush if you don't use odorless thinner I guarantee you you're going to be working alone and you're going to be the most unpopular person in the house now just use just the top corner of the brush it will begin mixing this blending it and I'm going to beat the brush occasionally just to knock off excess paint that I pick up there just begin blending it together and by just beating the brush you don't have to go through the whole cleaning procedure just give it a good hard won't there knock it a good one okay now I'm gonna fluff this cloud a little mmm can't make those little noises there just fluff it up like so give give it another beat and a bang you know there we are sort of looks like a bomb went off air doing so now if you ever want to paint a big explosion big bomb you know how to do it we both learned something there very lightly very lightly just want to go right across it and just blend it very softly three hairs and some air that's all it takes okay knock off at excess paint now then as I mentioned earlier there's a piece of masking tape across here I have that owner only to give us a beautiful straight horizon line so let's take it off unless the fun parts pulling that off now then we can go up here and begin playing a little bit might take a clean dry brush and put the least little touch of the liquid clear right up to the horizon when you're using this clear one of the neatest things try this at home take it clear and liquid white mix it together in about equal proportions and then put it on your canvas make some of the most beautiful effects you've ever seen you'll like it you'll like it now that I'm gonna take a just little liner brush filbert brush I'm sorry little filbert brush here put a little color on it I like to sort of lay out a basic idea when I'm gonna do a little seascapes because I want to keep the eye this wave transparent so come right up here and watch let's just go there we are our major wave it'll come right along in there somewhere it'll curl over that sort of help like so and maybe we'll have some stones in here I don't know somewhere here we'll have some stones see it doesn't matter you just do anything that you want to do there the only thing I'm worried about saving is this nice place where the eye of our wave will be I want to keep that nice and clean and sparkly let's get a little a little bit of that they little blue be right back grab some alizarin crimson I love blue okay Nathan just gonna put a little touch of color right up in here maybe a touch more of the crimson there this is just background color there were you seem right up to the horizon there and roughly down to where we're gonna have had we're we're really not committed so it's not a big deal that's the only part I'm trying to save is right there rest of it wherever okay and your item over here somewhere okay add a little phthalo green to my brush here maybe when he gets down in here we're gonna have a little touch of green I'm gonna add some black to that very dark life they look blue that little green I let that dead right on up it's looking for a super super dark cover there we go something about like so yeah now and then grab another brush maybe there'd be a little sand over here some will go into a van Dyck Brown little dark see EV it just mix them up a little bit on the brush maybe it's a little sand Liz right over here in the corner and all we're doing is just blocking in color add a little touch of yellow ochre to that little touch of yellow ochre as it gets down here there let's have let them blend together no big deal right now once again all we're doing is blocking in color when you come back and do anything that we want to do okay cleaner brush give it a nice scrub and beat the devil out of it okay now we can start playing back here grab a fan brush go into a little bit of white and we can make our first big decision looking for some waves back here in the background there's one just straight White's all it is there's another one that lives right back in here just straight white a little bit of white right along this major one now all we want to do is gently blend this back allow it to pick up that color is back here Gina splendid back okay grab the next one we blend him back by all the XSP Melfi brush and just use the paint that you have on the canvas and blend back see what happens is these dark pages that are important not the light ones and you begin getting all those beautiful little wave shapes in there and we can just pet a little of the white on the brush here just put the indication of some little things that are happening we back in there so you just making little wave shapes just here and there like so okay let's get a filbert here right in this area you don't have some fun so we'll take some straight titanium white and to that I'm gonna add the smallest little touch of CAD yellow very little color in there load the bristles full of paint now let's go right up in here if this is where the eye of the waves will be or the transparency then just scrub it you get tough with it get tough with it really scrub it down and now they will begin picking up some of this color just let it blend out darker and darker all I have been on the brush maybe some of it comes down in here see let all kinds of little things just happen brangham sort of back and forth a little and we can wash that brush okay no we have a good try two inch brush and we use just the top corner and very lightly very lightly make tiny little circles here and we can begin blending all that together tiniest little circles it just barely barely touching the canvas you just sort of wind it up for a while all wrong Rumsey there and now we can begin creating some shape just pull those colors together oh that's pretty already now shapes there we go okay now we won't add water to crash over so I just take some white on the brush and I went let's see here we find another brush I get two or three of them going here need a little more dark right in here there we are gotta have plenty of dark and nurse our light I'll show ya we can take her this is just titanium white I'll grab it give you a pull let it curl over think about that way you crashing over the top here grab it helps to make those little noises to moon there you okay now maybe I said there was gonna be some stones I'm gonna take some oh let's go in right in here have some Van Dyke Brown dark sienna mixed together and all right here we go mix up blue and alizarin crimson proportionately much more crimson take a little of each and maybe our stone lives right up in here now push it in very firmly now we're just gonna start blending this together all I'm doing is bending that knife I have the small knife pushing very firmly and begin blending this to get it let it pick up some of this white I want this to be very soft very subdued a little more white and just blend see what's happening there's a lot of pressure really a lot of pressure wipe your knife continually just make it look so soft maybe this wave comes right in front of it you have to make a big decision okay we'll take a little blue little blue crimson touch it white let's put up let's go right in here and I start putting the foam in here that's the fun part just think about that phone crashing and carrying on in there helps to make all these little noises okay now we have to clean the Grif I'm just wiped it on some paper towels here can we go right back into this is white with a least little touch of the CAD yellow at least little touch load a lot of color into the brush now then start right up here let's give it a little upward push create that nice foam there wipe your brush off in between loading so you have nice fresh color on let that foam just follow right around here think about how the waters gonna crash and churn and carry on all the little things that are going on huh water really it's boy gets having a good time out here yeah I'm wiping all the paint off the brush and very gently just gonna blend these back together get all the paint off the brush just you can get off just rub it clean our two-inch brush and very lightly once again just blend that together it comes out so soft and delicate looking people never believe you done there with a great big brush I don't take the liner brush go into some of that lavender here and I want to strengthen this edge so it really stands out there really strengthen the pear a little bit of that color on it again putting some little things in your wave these little things help show the shape there Kenny now that let's go back to a small knife don't tell you what tell you what let's have an opening between these stones and always looks neat come right in here need a few little things happening we're not to worry about this most I was going to be covered up with maybe a little over to show through and we have a little bit of action going on back there neat little action go back into our lavender and a brown mixture and maybe come right up here maybe there's a another stone there he is it's not a great deal of color not a great deal of color really push firmly there just really push it up again shaping your rucks take off all that excess paint just all types of little beautiful things happening there I hope you have unlimited time and you can just make oh layer after layer and beautiful stone after beautiful stone at this little knife is a really ideal for this okay Mimi in our world here there's a little touch of highlight that just Zing's right on down on that rock out there it is see there now that just grabbed the edges of that maybe and blend it back a little that's a mean-looking rocket now take a little touch of blue and white let's just put a little that right in here there okay a little bit of straight white and just by making these little circles here you can create all kinds of foam miss that's building and churning down here look at that and you can do it you can do it firm pressure then in that night bend it you can do entire seascapes this little knife so very very good for seascapes hmm okay and fine ball fan brush again maybe there's right in here so not a little Dewart lives right there wherever you want to put a little trough right there just very gently blend together this liquid clear is fantastic for seascapes it's one of the nicest things ever invented it works so well see that how that just there's at Roth right in there though that that flows for you okay there yes lost my knife for a second maybe there's another stone right here ends si in your world you put as many or as few stones as you want this is just a little bit of brown some bit lavender color we just let it churn and mist right in there that pretty though the way that just comes together can take a least little touch of yellow ocher least little touch a little bit of white and maybe let's just come right out in here sort of define this stone a little bit yeah such a small amount of the okra in there it really doesn't even look didn't look like ochre little touch of the blue why wipe tonight continually get off any excess paint you just blend all this together shoot let's have a big rock right here I'm getting so carried away need something to cover up this big opening here we just take some Van Dyck Brown here let's just bring him right off the canvas what the heck maybe he comes right there where comes right down in front and just fill this in scrape off all the excess paint Oh exercise dish ready get in there pull all of it out that you can King dinner a little knife I just want to blend all this together over here I'm gonna add a little bit of the phthalo blue and white actors a nice shadow color maybe there's a touch right in here a little highlight they're continually wiping the knife there we go hmm now let's have some fun maybe maybe maybe in our world maybe the water line here comes right push very firmly apparently like so just blend that back it's unbelievable what you can do with the knife it'll really truly you spend some time learning this son of a gun make friends with it make it you get for it cuz it will do things that you could not believe in creative illusion of a little mist here maybe maybe there's another little ripple and appear on the shore a little bit there okay know that we need some little fun things in here maybe and here we have just all kinds of little phone things living here there we go you can blend these until they you need to any degree of lightness softness harshness that you want can make it very very soft and take a little paint thinner little phthalo blue and white let's go back in here and begin putting in just a little wave indications and you can put in all kinds of these to really make your paintings stand out just all kinds of them if you've come across here I think we're the lights coming if you have a little bright spot here maybe this right in here it's a little bit brighter that I'm just shine hmm so maybe right along in here boom okay here's some they come right on around look at that see this gives shape and form to your weight there there we go just let your hand wiggle and jiggle them carry on this is where if you have a little nervous twitch you're ahead of the game boy you've got something going take advantage of it here comes one you have me right just let him go there but these things as I say this is what adds the little details that are so fantastic and if you're out selling paintings for example this is what will make your painting stand out over everybody else's it's around so spend some time and do some of these little things and enjoy it it's a fun part of it maybe even in here a few little gooders over in here something like so there's no in tradition the seascapes it should not be hard they shouldn't be a big mystery I think we've come up with some ways here to do some seascapes that even if you've never painted them before you'll have very very good success I'm gonna sign this one take a little read I will call it done I hope you've enjoyed it show you how to use the liquid clear and hair in just a few minutes you can do a fantastic little seascape and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and I'll see you next time ah you
