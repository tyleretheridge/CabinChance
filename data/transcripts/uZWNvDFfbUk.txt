- Hi, welcome back. Certainly
glad you could join us today. I thought today we'd just do a fantastic little painting that I think you'll enjoy. So let's start out and have
run all the colors across the screen that you need
to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've
got done up here already. We have our standard old
pre-stretched canvas up here. And as you can plainly see
I've covered the bottom of it with a little bit of black gesso. A little bit, about
so-high. Not quite half. You don't want to divide it totally. The black gesso, then I put a little bit
of liquid clear on it. Then on top of that
I've just put a mixture of midnight black and a
little sap green in it, just sort of a real gray color
with a little green in it. And the top is just covered with liquid white like
normal, and it's all wet. Don't let it dry before you start. Now the black gesso had dried before we put the transparent paint
on, but everything's wet now. So let's just keep playin'
with those same colors. We'll use black, and a
little bit of sap green. Be right back, have to sneak
up here and get the green. And just load a little color
right into the bristles. Now there, today let's just do a fun, little painting, and just enjoy. I'm just going to take the brush and just make a little circles. Little, circular patterns all over. Let it go. Just wherever you want it. This is really a nice way of just taking out your frustrations. If you're having a bad day,
this is a nice painting to do, 'cause it'll make you feel good. You can just work out
all your hostilities. There. A little more color. It's just black, sap green once again. Not a great deal of green,
though. Mostly black. Want it to be just sort
of a greenish-gray color when it mixes with the liquid
white that's on the canvas. There. Just every kind of little pattern. Just try to mix it up and make
it look different all over. Like that. Here and there. And you begin seeing things
in there, just by doing this. I think I'll make a scene that
has a lot of trees far away, like you're looking deep into the woods. And so we just need some
background cover there. I'm going to add a little van dyke brown, a little dark sienna to the brush. And here and there. Not everywhere, but just here and there. And add a little bit of that. Maybe even a touch of, little bit of alizarin
crimson here and there. Not much, though, just a little. Just to change the flavor so it's not all exactly the same. There. A little more of the black, maybe a little more dark
sienna mixed with it. Come right in here and
drop in some little, just a little circular patterns. Alright, I bet your sayin, "Well, I've really done it this time. That's a total mess you've
got started already." You may be right. Hope not. There. But notice how everything is going on. There's light spots up in here, and there's spots right
beside it that are very dark. And that way you have a
variety of patterns going. So when we begin putting all of our little trees and stuff in the foreground it will give the feeling of being deep, deep back in the woods. Now, pick our liner brush. We'll go right into some of that. I'm just goin' to use
that black and sap green. That's fine. Doesn't matter. Get the paint very thin
with paint thinner. And let's go up in here. And maybe in these light
spots. here and there, we'll begin putting the indication of all kinds of little tree
limbs and branches and twigs. And it doesn't matter if
you can't see all of them. You can't see where it
starts or where it stops. 'Cause they're goin' be looking
between a lot of foliage. And most of these will probably
end up being covered up. But some of them will show through. And people will think
you've literally worked for days putting all these
little things in here. Shhh! We don't tell them any different. There we are. Just a few. Just a few. You don't have to get too
carried away with 'em. There we go. That's enough to get us started. We can add some more later if we want to. We'll just use that same ol' dirty brush. What the heck. It's workin' pretty good. No use messin' with it if it's workin'. I'm going to go right into the yellow. Be right back here. Grab a little bit of sap green. So we have yellow and sap green. A little yellow ochre. Indian yellow. Once in awhile a little
touch of the bright red. And the bright red is really
in there to dull the green. Alright, now then. Let's begin
picking out little things. Now if you sort of look at your painting, and each one will be different, you can begin picking out
little shapes and forms, and things happening. Use just the corner of the brush. And just start picking out individuals. Just begin picking out individuals. Wherever you think they should be. There we go. Ok, change the flavor a little. Add a little more of the
yellow ochre maybe to this one. So it looks like there's a
different bush right there. But see, it covers up
the base of that one. Now we don't want to
kill all this background because all those little
patterns that you put in there by themselves nearly look like
all kinds of little things. Add a little more of the
greens and the yellows, and all the colors here. And just sort of let these things happen. But once again, everybody's painting will be totally different. Totally unique. So don't just try to copy. When you're doing yours,
look at what happens. Take advantage of what happens. And did you know, if you've
painted with us before, we do not make mistakes. We have a happy accident
every once in awhile. But we don't make mistakes. Because we learn to work with anything that happens
on this piece of canvas. You're truly the master
of your world here. There we go. But is that beginning
to give you the feeling of being deep in the woods? I hope so. There. We just layer after layer after layer. There we go. And these layers, work
on one layer at a time, and keep coming forward. That's what'll create the illusion of distance in your painting. I know I say that so much, but to me, it is very, very important in a painting to have depth and distance in it. There. Now then, maybe we'll go back up here. We need some little things over
here on the other side, too. We don't it totally left out. There. Just sort of let 'em overlap. Maybe they just come together right there. We don't know. All kinds of
things happen in the woods. It used to be a fantastic place for my little squirrel to live. I gotta show you another
picture of that little rascal. If you've been with us during this series, I've showed you two or three times our little squirrel that we call Peapod, the pocket squirrel. And he's one of the most
precious, little creatures. And while I'm doing this,
we'll just put him up here. Now after he eats, hi little
rascal, he'll sleep anywhere. He is the laziest little
devil. Watch him go. He just climbs up sometimes, I have an old towel here,
and he just climbed up in it, and sort of made himself
at home, and kicked back. Oh, tummy's full and
it's a nice, warm day, and off to sleep we'll go. But isn't he cute? And after he goes to sleep, you can literally just pick him up. Look at that! Looks like he's
at the beach, doesn't he? Kicked back there and gettin' a few rays. But that's how lazy that little rascal is after he gets his tummy filled. I think he's just one
of the most precious, little creatures I've ever had. Did I say his name was Peapod? And he wants to live in
your pocket. (laughs) He's probably, oh he's probably
five weeks old now maybe. It'll be another couple of months before we can turn him loose and then, off he'll go and he'll
have his own family. There. And hopefully he'll
stay around my backyard when I turn him loose
and still visit with me. But if he doesn't, I know he's happy, and he's doing what squirrels should do. There. Okay, maybe right in here. While you were watching the squirrel, all we've done is just continue to add some little bushes and
tree things here and there. There we go. But isn't that a neat
way of doing a background that looks like there's just
layer after layer of woods and forest, and all kinds of things? Years ago when I was
a traditional painter, I might've worked for two or three weeks to produce an effect like this. And chances are, I
would've worked it to death and it would've been very muddy. And by muddy, I mean
you just work your color so much they just sort of
all turn gray and brown. Get dirty lookin'. I had a lot of problems with that when I was a traditional painter. But this is so fast and so fresh, that you don't have time
for it to get muddy. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we can take our black
with a little green in it, and go back here and there. And we can add in a couple
more little sticks and twigs. And you can sort of look at little patterns that happened here. And where you think there should be some little things to hold all these up. There. Just wherever you want 'em. We don't want too many.
Don't want too many. Maybe even right in here. Once again, every painting
is gonna be different, and that's what makes it great. But look at yours and see where you think a little stick should live. A little twig or whatever you need to hold up all your
branches on your trees. I think today, it's such a good day. Let's get crazy. Let's get crazy. Maybe (laughs) here we go. Maybe there's a big cliff here. A big drop-off. A big gulley. So I'm gonna put a little,
I know you can't see this, but it's just straight van dyke brown. And I'm putting that there 'cause I want to have a nice embankment right there. Nice cliff or drop-off or gorge. Whatever you want to call it. I know it's going to be there. And to that, let's say I'm
havin' one of those days when you're just feeling sort of flaky and you just do nice things
and have fun with painting. A little dark sienna, a
little van dyke brown, a little white. Don't over mix it. It's most important for it to stay marbled like that. And you cut off that little roll of paint. All those different mixtures
are right there in that roll. You can even see 'em in there. See, there's white on
the bottom, right there. And then down here,
there's a nice brown color. So it gives you all those
little things happening. Now I want to show, this is
why I put the brown there. Barely touch. Just graze it. This is just like you were
laying snow on the mountain. There we go. Just putting
a few little things. Something like that. Probably makes no sense at all yet, but I have something in mind, I think. Alright, let's go back, we'll
go back to the old brush here that had the greens and stuff on it. Greens, yellow, yellow
ochre, Indian yellow. A touch of bright red once in awhile. But see how we're loading that brush. It's actually being pushed. Do
it real slow so you can see. It's being pushed. And right there on the tip you can see that little ridge of paint. Okay, let's go up here. Now with that little ridge of paint, I want to make some little
grassy areas back here. But that's actually all
you're painting with. See it? And now we'll have some
little grassy areas, and they come right up here. And this is a very sharp
drop-off in my mind. So maybe there's some
nice things that just literally hang over the edges. And that easy. That
easy you can make these. I like doing banks like
this where you have all these little grassy things
that hang over the edge. There. Those are fun to me. And people love these
kind of little paintings. It's just like gesso, to me, is one of the neatest things
that has ever been invented. I don't know why somebody
didn't do before I did. Now everybody's doing it. There. But isn't that neat? Maybe back here we'll have
that one hang over, too. I just like seeing them
weeds hanging over that. Look what a beautiful effect
it creates right in there. My gosh, you could slip off from there and be there forever and ever. Nobody'd ever find you
down in that big thing. There we go. Tell you what. If I'm gonna fall off in there, I want to land on something soft. I'll find a fan brush,
dip it in liquid white. Into the titanium white. Gonna give a touch, be right back with phthalo
blue right in there. So we have liquid white to thin the paint, titanium white and a little
touch of phthalo blue. And maybe, here we go. Right here. I see it. There's a little waterfall. Lives right in there. That easy. And you can do that basically, go over and down, over and down. It's most important you
have a flat edge up here. I'll do it again. I
don't want him that big, so I'll just cut him off later. But that's how it's done. And our waterfall,
maybe it comes down here and hits a rock and does this. We'll put another rock in front here in a minute and it'll all make sense. There. Now I'm gonna put some splashes. Waterfalling that far, there'd be some nice
splashes goin' on down here. There we go. Now, let me grab a two-inch brush, put a little touch of
titanium white on it, and pull straight down. Just straight down. Something like that. And go across. See there? And instantly, we have water. That's one of the neatest, nicest things about this whole technique is water. Now then, we can just take the fan brush and come back in here. And clean up the edges, put some little ripples across the water where it's flowing out here. And whatever. It's all we need. Now, back to our old knife. Take some van dyke brown, and in my mind there's gonna be, maybe there's a projection comes out here. And you make any kind of
little projection you want. Maybe there's a bump
there, comes right down. See, put that there, and put
a little highlight on it, and all of a sudden it will push that waterfall way back here. Watch what it does here. Least little touch of
color, and just pull down. Barely touching the canvas. But it'll have a tendency
to push all that back. And we can bring this one
right out in front of it. There. Now, back to our ol' brush that has the yellows and the greens on it. We can come right back in here. Let me get a little more color. Come right back in here, and just let those things flow right over. Now, if you have trouble
making the colors stick, add the least little touch of paint thinner to your brush. But the least, least little bit. And it'll thin the paint, and it'll flow right over the
top of this thicker paint. Now then, over here on the other side, we have to have something to hold the other side in or it will get away. Maybe right about here. Let's have a nice projection comes out. Tell you what, this comes right down, and all that's weed back. See how we can change your mind, just put things in there? And in your world you can do this. Anything that you can
imagine, you can have. At least on this piece of canvas. But at least on this
piece of canvas, you can. I like that. That pushes all it back. Put a little water
splash around his foots. Right down here. Now here's a little trick. If you want to show water
dripping down, lift it up. Now it looks like the water,
see? Is dripping down. Touch up, and the water comes down. I know that sounds crazy,
but it works. Trust me. Betcha heard that the last time you went to buy a used
car, didn't ya? (laughs) There we are. Now take a little black, a little blue, little alizarin crimson. Just make a dark color on
the ol' two-inch brush. I wanna have a nice bush
sitting out here on this, so I need some dark in here, just so when I put some
light on it, it'll show. I wanna make that
waterfall a little smaller, so all I do is just cut him down. See? You can cut the waterfall down to any size that you want him. Any size that you want him. Alright, now then, let's put, ahh, let's make it a little brighter. Oh, that's better. See I just added a bit
more of a cad yellow to it so it would stand out
against the background. Now, there's a lot of moisture
if there's a waterfall here. And usually, where
there's a lot of moisture, the plants seem to hang more. They just get lazy because they don't have to work for water, I guess. Now, tell you what, maybe there's another big rock right here. Let's do this, maybe we'll
just pull it right on out here. This is just van dyke brown, little touch of dark sienna into it. Somethin' like that, now. Back to our highlight
cutter, brown and white. We'll just come right in here with the indication of a
few, little highlights. Don't want to much or it will distract. And then right over this edge, I'm gonna take this small
knife, so that's very dark. So it looks like there's
a little overhang there. I hope you can see that. That's sort of a sneaky
little way of making like an overhang where you can stand and watch this beautiful,
little waterfall. And we'll have maybe just
a little bush lives there. Little bushes live
everywhere in our world. Little things, just growin' all out here. But when you're painting,
make up little stories. Imagine that this place is
real, at least in your mind. And mentally, if you can
see it, you can paint it. And people ask, 'cause we have almost 300 half hour shows on. People say, "Where do you
come up with all these ideas?" Well, a lot of them come from people sending photographs of things
they'd like to see painted. We get hundreds of photographs, and I paint a lot of pictures
from those photographs. But a lot of them come from right here. I just sort of sit down
and make up little stories. And it helps to be a little crazy, so that gives me sort of
an advantage. (laughs) But, in your world,
just think about things, and mentally if you can
see 'em, you can do 'em. So just a little practice. Ok, we said we was gonna get crazy. Shoot, I'd like to live right here, so I'm gonna put me a house. I'm gonna put me a house
that lives right here. Maybe an ol' rundown house out here. I want a big house today. I draw little cabins all the time. Today, I want a big house. Since this is our world, we can do that. We can do that. Didn't you like that little squirrel? Wasn't he the wildest thing? I like it when he just sort
of lays around like that. I just think it's so cute. There. Well, this is goin' to be a big house. Great big house. And all we're doing here is
just basically blocking it in. All we wanna do is just come up with the basic shape for this ol' house. There. Just van dyke brown, a little dark sienna here and there, but mostly van dyke brown. I have had a little sienna. There. Well, now we gotta make
some big decisions here. Tell you what. Let's do. I have the same highlight
color I was usin' down here, it's just brown and white. Maybe we'll just put
some the indication here of some old boards going this way. We usually make 'em going the other way. But just touching and
working your way across here. Give a little, tiny little pull-down. There. Just keep it goin', back and forth. There. And vary the colors a little 'cause boards some of them are lighter
in color than others, and some are darker,
and some weather better. Now then, we take a clean, dry brush. One here, and some air, and just gently, gently go across that. It makes a very nice old
wood effect. That easy. Now, maybe this carpenter, maybe he had a toddy or
two on the job. You know? That happens sometimes. Boy,
does it happen sometime. Let's take dark sienna, van dyke brown, and just a little white. See? There's the old color we were using. Now here's the new color.
See how much darker it is? This is gonna be on the shadow side. So we'll come right over here. Maybe these boards on this side
of the building go this way. Who knows? This is our building. We can make any way we want it. Any way that we want it. And today, I think they outta go that way. What the heck. Back to our brushes. Dry. Touch that. Give it a little pull. Now, tell you what.
Let's really get crazy. Take some white and some black, mix it together, make a gray. Nice gray color. And use a little edge of the knife. Start right here at the roof, and just begin pulling down
and working the layers here. I want to create the illusion
of some nice, little shingles. Just sort of gray shingles on this. But that's gonna mix with that brown that's already on the canvas, and give you all kinds
of little variations, which are very nice. Very nice. There. See? There they come. Just shingle after shingle. Years ago I was a carpenter
and I'll tell you this, it's not that easy to
put shingles on a roof. And if you've ever watched Dana Jester, one of our teachers that's
on the show frequently, he's one of our national
staff of teachers. He's a fantastic painter. But if you ever watch him, for many years he, too, was a carpenter. So he can tell ya, it
was not that easy to do. Take a little light color.
This can be just light gray. And we'll just sort of highlight these edges so they stand out a little. Now maybe, let me grab a small knife here. Maybe this is a two-story
house. Let's get crazy. Put a window there. A window
there. A window there. I told you I was gonna
have a big house this time. Just scrape it out. Just use some black. Nobody's home today. You can put light in the
window if you wanted to. A little light color. Just
sort of outline these a little. Like that. Wherever you want. But, now we notice some windows. Maybe up here there's a little
something for the attic. That's probably where I'd have to live. Now that we've got that black on there. Let's put the door over here. You put your door wherever you want it. But I thought today we'd put it over here. Shoot. Tell you what. Let's put, I got a
minute remaining here so, let's have a little shed,
or I mean, not a shed. A little roof, a little
porch. Stands right out here. I said shed. You can
make a shed the same way, but today we're just
gonna have a little porch to hold up everything and keep the rain off the guy that lives in here. I guess we need a little post to hold the porch up or it'll fall. There. Now then, we can take, we can take, put in a little grass right in here. Shoot, we about have a finished painting. Isn't that a super little thing? Try this one. I believe you'll like it. And if you have time, send us
a photo of what you're doing. Every once in awhile we put 'em together and show 'em on TV. Until then, happy painting.
God bless, my friend. (light lounge music) - [Voiceover] This
