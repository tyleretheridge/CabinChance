- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, 'cause today, thought I'd do a painting that's just a lot of fun
and I think you'll enjoy it. Let's start out and have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you'd need to paint along with this. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got done up here. Have my standard, oh, 18x24 inch canvas, double primed, pre-stretched. Today, I've covered it
with a very thin coat of just black gesso, just
covered the entire canvas and allowed that to dry completely. On top of the black gesso,
that we've put a little bit of liquid clear. Let me say that again, a little bit. It takes very, very small
amount to make it work. While the clear is still wet,
then we've added a little bit of color to it, and today, I've chosen prussian blue, a little bit of sap green, and a little bit of van dyke brown. Just covered the entire
canvas and that's still wet. So, that'll allow us to
do some fantastic things that I think you'll enjoy. Let's start off today, we'll
use a little fan brush. A little bit of titanium white. Just load a little color
right onto the brush. There we are. And, let's go up here and just, let's just have some fun. This is a day you can just be crazy. Just spin things around. Let 'em just dance and play and-- ♫ la la la ♫ See, there you go. No big deal. Just enjoy, just enjoy it. Just spin it, make all kinda
little shapes and designs. Whatever you want. There. Just dance it in, like so. Just very loose and free. Let it happen, let it happen, 'cause we don't care, we don't
make mistakes, as you know. All we do is have happy
accidents in our world. So, the worst thing can
happen here is wonderful. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it,
oils are so forgiving that we really don't worry about mistakes. Maybe a little bit over in
here, too, what the heck. It's your world, so you
decide, and you can decide how bright you want this, or
how dark, it doesn't matter. Anyway that you want it. Any ol' way. There. Okay, lemme grab, oh, two inch brush. There we go, make sure it's good and dry. With the old two inch
brush, I'm just gonna take the corner of it, and,
very gently, just begin sort of winding this up. Just blending it a little bit. I don't want to lose
all those little shapes, but we just sort of want
to blend it together. That about like it. That's really 'bout all we're looking for. Just, we're just making
a little background. It'll end up being far, far away. Turn it a little bit to
one direction, and then, then maybe a little bit
to the other direction, it doesn't matter. There. This is, as I say, just
gonna be background mater-- I tell you what, I'm gonna
do a big forest today. I think I'll do that. And, this'll end up just
being some shapes that are shining through the
trees, far, far away. Okay, and that's about all I want today. Alright, let's have some fun already. Let's take, we'll use that
same brush, what the heck. We'll go into a little prussian bluuuueee. Oh, we'll pick up a little bit of black, maybe even a little brown. 'Bout like that. I'm gonna get some crimson,
too, I like it, too. There. Maybe a little more crimson. Now, then. But, notice, we're just tapping,
just tapping one corner, basically, right into the paint. Let's go up in here. Now, then, maybe there's some
indications of some trees that live far, far away back here. We'll just use the ol' two inch brush and just begin tapping
in some basic shapes. That's all we're looking for. Don't, don't worry about
a lot of detail here. We really don't care. All we're looking for
is just basic shapes. Something about like so. There. Just sort of let it happen. Alright. And, over in here, we don't, we'll just drop it in. Now, I'm gonna add the least
little bit of titanium white to my color, just so it
stands out against the dark. You know, you need dark to show light, and light to show dark. It's just like in life. You need a little sorrow in your life so you know when the good times happen. There. Alright. I'm ready for a good
time right now, though. Now, I'mma go into a little
bit of the titanium white. This is just, basically, titanium white, and let's pick out a few little
things that we'll separate and make 'em a little different. Like, there's trees in front, some behind. It still looks bluish,
but it has a little touch of titanium white in it. Just as a little separator. There, see? Looks like layers and layers
and layers of little trees, far away. There we go. And, just by doing this,
you can create many, many layers of trees. We're gonna have a forest,
we need a lot of trees. Shoot, all my little friends
have to have a little place to live out here. Alright. Shoot, we about to get this
painting finished already. I'm takin' but just a second. Now, using these big old two
inch brushes, you can really, you can cover some space very quickly, and you can do some detail
that people will think that you've, that you've
spent forever with little one-haired brushes, just
worked yourself to deat-- Shh, it's our secret. Let's take a little white. A little dark sienna. Put a little van dyke in there,
too, it'll darken it more. That's better. Maybe, a little a little
roll of paint lives right on the edge of the knife. See there? It's right out on the very
tippy, end of the knife. Then, we can go up here,
and just here and there, and there and here. I just want to put the indication
that maybe there's a few little tree trunks that you can see. I don't want many. Just a few. They sorta hide back in here. And, that's really enough. And then, very lightly,
we can sorta blend those right into the painting. Three hairs and some air. Just barely touching. See? That sorta pushes 'em back. But, it gives you the indication that maybe there's some tree trunks for those little trees back in there. Mm kay. Let's mix up some dark color. (inhales) Let's take, alright, there we go, good. We'll use prussian blue,
some midnight black. Van dyke brown. What the heck, (chuckles)
crimson and sap gree-- All your dark colors. Just throw 'em in there. Really doesn't matter. We're looking for a dark color that has both blue and green in it. Other than that, no big deal. Let me wipe the old knife, here. We just wipe the knife on a paper towel, keep it clean. (Mumbles) Let me get a clean brush. That one's sorta dirty. I want this to be very dark. We use another two inch brush. Tap a little color. Right into the bristles. See, you just give it a little push. Boop boop boop, like that. Alright, let's go right up in here. We have to start making
some major decisions in our world. I want some big trees. I mean big, big trees. So, (sighs) okay. I know this is scary. Jump up here in the
middle of your painting and decide that there's
gonna be a big tree that lives right there. There he comes. Use the corner of the brush. Just the corner. ♫ Just the corner ♫ Let it go. ♫ La la la ♫ Where you are. See? See, there you go, wherever. And, all we're doing is
putting in some dark background so our light color will show. We're gonna come back, we're gonna put some
leaves on all these trees. Some nice greenery. But, we have to have the dark in order for the light to show. There. See there? There goes all your little
trees you've worked so hard for. But, they're still there. We know they're back here. You're just workin' so good. Yeah, why not? (chuckles) I know, you say, "Eh, Bob, you've
done it this time." Maybe so. But, just drop it in. Don't worry about it. As you know, we, we don't
make any mistakes here. So, we don't care about it. We really don't worry. You know, painting,
painting should be fun. It'd be, it'd be something
that makes your-- just enjoy life. And, one thing that
painting will do for you, I get letters everyday
that attest to this, painting will make you see nature. People write and they tell
me, "There's been a tree "livin' in my front yard for
20 years and I never saw it. "Never saw it, until I started painting. "And, I went out the other
day, and I made friends "with the old tree in the
yard, and I understand him now. "I see color, I see shape. "I see, I see why he's so
special in God's world." And painting can open these doors for you. If I keep a yakin' here and a
paintin', we're not gonna have anything left of our background trees. There. But, as long as you have
the practice of makin' 'em, that's really all that counts. 'Cause if you want make one tree, you can make a million trees. Okay, now we got some dark color in there. Let's have some fun, now. Well, there's a fan brush. It's got a little white on it. I'm gone take, I'mma put
brown, just van dyke brown on one side and white on the other. See, it's dark on one
side, light on the other. 'Kay? Now, then, let's say our light's
coming right through here and hitting all these trees. Keep our dark side over there. And, we can make a tree
trunk and make both sides at one time. (gently whistles) Dark and light. Little more of the dark. Little more of the light. You decide where they live. (gently whistles) There's another one. Theeere's another one. Let's go over on the other side, here. Add a little touch of
paint thinner to my brush. Thin the paint just a little so it'll slide off there easier. Over here there's one. (gently whistles) Just let it, let it go. Little more color. We don't know. Sometimes you just see
indications, little parts of some that are hiding way back in there. You decide later where they
are and where they live. Well, we'll take this brush here. Yeah, that's okay. (chuckles) We'll just use it anyway. It's a dirty-- But, if we go right into
the yellow, since it has blue and black in it, it'll
make a beautiful green color. See? That easy. Get a little yellow ochre. We'll add a little Indian
yellow now and then-- And, every so often, I'm
gone touch a little of this bright red. I know, you say, "Why you hittin' red?" Because red and green are
opposites, and it will dull the green. Alright. Push, though-- You see that little ridge, right there? We're tryin' ta get one just like it on the end of the brush. See it? Beautiful close up shot, there. Gonna have to give Cathy a raise. There we are. 'Kay, let's go up in here. Now, then, let's begin
finding our individual trees. Just use the corner of the
brush and begin picking 'em out. Just use the corner of the brush. Load a little more color. Don't be afraid to load
some paint on your brush. There we go. Just drop 'em in. Think about basic shape, basic form. And, off you go. Off you go. You should only be limited
here by your imagination. 'Cause, your imagination
can take you to any world that you want to go to. And, with a little practice,
you can create any illusion that your heart desires. At least, on the piece of canvas. There. I go home and try that
and get in big trouble, but here, I can do anything that I want. Any ol' thing. It's my world. Take a little sap green. Add right in there. I'm gonna put the least
little bit of paint thinner on the brush. Remember our golden rule: a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So, I've thinned this just
enough to make it a lit-- mmm, a little bit thinner
than what's on the canvas, that's what we're lookin' for. Let's go up in here. And, here comes this lil' rascal. There it is. Theeere it is. See him? Just drop 'em in. Once again, I know you
get tired of hearing it, but it's important, think
about shape and form. Don't just, don't just get
carried away and drop 'em in. I know it, it gets
feeling good, (chuckles) and, you know, you don't want to stop, and off you go. But, take your time. Take your time. You have no time
restraints, hardly, at home. You can just play and have a good time. There. See? I want it to get darker
and less and less-- that's a little quiet area back there. Okay, let's go over to the other side. That tree. That tree over here said he didn't want to be left out. He was talkin' to me. I'm not gonna leave him out. We'll put a little, little
bit of greenery on him, too. Now, we said our light
was coming through h-- Right through there, so
add more over on this side than you do the other side, (swallows) so it gives that impression of, of roundness for the tree. There we go. Mmm. Isn't that a neat way of
making a lot of leaves on trees very easily? Now, if the two inch
brush intimidates you, and it does, at first. When you first start
painting, that's a big brush. It looks just like what you
painted the barn with last week. If it intimidates you
when you first start, use a one inch brush,
it'll work just as well, it's just slower. Just takes a little longer. There. So. But, either one of the brushes will work. And, you can make just gorgeous foliage. It's really unbelievable
what you can make with it. There. I'm gonna add a little bit more paint, and maybe, yeah. We'll put the indication of
somethin' right along in here that, it just hangs
right over this old tree. What the heck? We can have it anywhere we want it, here. Hmm. Maybe, I'm gonna add more yellow. I'm gonna put a little bit
of liquid white on my brush. I wanna do two things: I wanna thin the color,
of course, to make it a little thinner, but
I want to lighten it. I want to lighten it in value. Alright. Maybe? Yeah, you're right. Maybe there's a happy little
bush lives right here. See? There we go. Try to leave a dark area. See, there's a dark between these two? A dark is your separator. It's your best friend, take care of it. Take care of it. I'm gonna go a little
heavier into the yellow ochre and maybe even a little
more of the bright red. Let's put a little
sparkler right in there. Yeah, there he is. There he is. Sometimes I get crazy and I
give, I give all these little bushes and trees names. Talk to 'em. That's okay. People look at you like
you're a little strange, but, painters, painters are allowed
to be a little different. We're sort of expected
to be a little weird, and that's okay. Painters, I think, have
more fun than most people, so, it's alright. Life's too short not to enjoy it. There. Alright, wow, all these
places in big tree-- You know, my little squirrel
would have a ball here. I showed a, I showed a little
bit of my little squirrel last time, and, I wanna show you again. I think we got a little
bit of footage, here. He's one of the cutest little
devils you've ever seen. Little baby gray squirrel. And I been raisin' him since he was, oh gosh, he was a tiny little rascal. Looked like a little rat
when I first got him. But, he's doin' wonderful now. In fact, by the time you
see this, he'll probably be livin' out in the yard
with, with his namesake. We call this little
squirrel "Peapod Junior," and he'll probably be livin'
out in the yard with him. Isn't that somethin'? It's hard to get him
to eat, as you can see. Little rascals are somethin' else. There. I'm just puttin' in a
few more little bushes while you watchin' my little baby, there. At this stage, he's, hmm, probably about 45, 50 days old, maybe. And, I'm guessing, because when I got him, his eyes were already open. He had fell out of a
tree and a very nice lady brought him to me and asked
me if I would take care of him 'til he'd got big enough to release him. Yeah, you know me, I got a soft, soft place in my heart
for these little rascal, I just can't, I can't say no. I would, (exhales gentle laugh) I'd be like one of these bird
ladies, like, that I work with so often, I'd have a whole house
full of animals if I could. Alright. I didn't do anything while,
while I was gone there, that you don't know how to do. I just put in some more
little bushes and trees. We need a little land back here. I'm gonna take-- What am I gonna take? We'll take some white. Little van dyke, little dark sienna. We'll mix 'em together. Maybe I can put the least little
touch of crimson in there. (gasp) Ooh, I like that. Don't over mix your color,
leave it sort of marbled. Cut off a little roll of paint. Let's go up in here. And, maybe there's a little path. Gotta have a place to
walk in the woods, here. Gosh, it's just gonna be
such a beautiful little spot. I'd have to come out
here and talk to Peapod. See how he's doin'. Yeah, there. 'Cause I'd worry about him. Even if he was out there in
the tree, havin' a good time, I'd worry about him. I'm like Old Mother Hen with my animals. There. But, see? That's still picking up that
color that's underneath, and it sorta bleeds through. I hope you can see that okay. There. Makes it look like a little path. But, I want it to stay,
I want it to stay dark, 'cause this is deep in the woods. This is one of them quiet,
sneaky little places. There, not many people come here. Not too many people come here. This is, this is where
the little animals live. Let a little light, just a
zing, right down the path. Just enough. There. Alright. Allllright. We go back to my bush brush. The brush I was makin' the bushes with. And, let's come right along in here and just bring a few of them
little rascals right out over the path. See? There they come. Theeere they come. We'll have one right out through here. But, do one bush at a time. Just one little rascal at a time. Little more of the Indian yellow. Pop one in (blows through
teeth) right there. Just sort of decide where
these things live in your world and put 'em in. There we are. Somethin' like so. Yeah, then let's take our liner brush. We'll use a little brown, a little white, and I put paint thinner with
it to make it very thin. Turn the brush, that brings
it to a nice, sharp point. And, we'll go up in here. And here and there, and there and here. We'll just put the indication
of a few little sticks and twigs, and (breathes gently) little things that we need in there, just to hold some bushes up. Put 'em mostly in the dark areas, though, that's where you'd see 'em. A few over in this side. Don't want 'em left out. Dee doo doo. There we are. (splashing)
You decide. Maybe some. Maybe here's one that's quite dark, 'cause it's got a lighter
background, so it'll show up. You have to make those big decisions. (splashing) Speaking of big decisions, we gotta minute left, here. (laughs gently) Ok-- You ready? (chuckles) If you've
painted with me before, you know what's comin', don'tcha? We got a minute or so left here, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, yeah. 'Kay, you ready? This is your bravery test, big time. Right here... (gentle falling whistle) is a big tree. I mean a big tree. This is your bravery test. Let's give him a little friend that lives right along in here. (gentle whistle) Just let it come right on down, like so. I'm using mostly just black. Midnight black. There. See? Quite a bit of paint on there. There we are. Boy, that is two monster trees. But, that's what makes it fun, be brave. Take a chance. I get letters, sometime,
from people, and they say, "Why'd you put that big tree in there? "I liked it so much better." When you paint yours,
leave out the old big tree if you don't want it. I just want to show you as
many things as I can show you in the time that we have here. Just to get you excited about it. Turn you loose on the world. There. Let's take a little white. Little prussian blue. A little black. Mix 'em together, but I
wanna leave 'em marbled. Little roll of paint. Now, barely, barely,
barely, barely touching. Just like you were puttin'
snow on the mountain. Just let it zip right on
down the side of this tree. (mouthing gentle motor) But, just barely touch it. Barely touch it. Don't get greedy. I know it gets good. You wanna do it too much. There. A little bit on this one
so he's not left out. Just a big old tree. (gentle whistle) Little bit of black, put right
there, so we can determine that this big tree, maybe, is in the front of the little one. That's the way them
big guys are, isn't it? Always wanna be out in the front. There. And, you can just, sort of, play the black and the light color back and forth. Now, if you let this paint
build up, when this is dry, it will actually feel like real bark. (splashing) I'm gonna take a paint
thinner on the liner brush. There we are. I wanna make some very thin paint. And, we'll just draw
a limb or two on here. Now, this old tree is so big,
maybe all of it's greenery's way up high. But, down here, there's a
couple 'a old dead limbs that are still hangin' around. There they are, see 'em? (mouths gentle motor) Just add paint thinner. If you have trouble making it flow, just add a little bit
more of the paint thinner. Hey, here's one. Here's one. It's comin' from, we don't know where. We don't even know. Don't care. We just know it's up here, somewhere. Just coming down, here comes one. It goes behind that one. There. Wherever. Oops, there's one that's broke off. See? And you have those in nature. Absolutely have 'em. (splashing) Now, we can take a little
bit of our light color and we can add just an
indication of a little highlight, right up in there, like that. (splashing) Shoot. We can just, here and there,
add a stick or a twig. Couple over here. (splashing and brush tapping) Back to my little bush brush. And, I'll put, just the
indication of some little bushes that are growing up around his foot. Somethin' about like that. Just, it pushes it back into the painting. And then, let's take a
little bit of the bright red. Little paint thinner. And, I think we'll sign
this little painting. Really hope you've enjoyed this. It's a very simple little painting. It'll teach you how to
use all the equipment. And, most important, most important, it'll bring a lot of joy to your heart. If you have time, after you
paint, take a little picture and send us. We'd love to see it, here. And, every so often, we'd
put 'em together on a board and we like to show you
what everybody's doin' around the country. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting. God bless, my friend. (grooving music)
