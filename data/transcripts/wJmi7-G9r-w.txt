oh hey welcome back I'm certainly glad you could join us today I thought today would do a fantastic little painting it'll just do good things in here for you so I tell you what let's start out haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and as usual they'll come across in the same orders I have them on the palette while they're doing that let's go on up here I've got my standard ol 18 by 24 pre-stretched double prime canvas up here and I put a little piece of contact paper on it so it's going to have a little oval I love these little ovals they've they've become so popular and we get so many letters about them how'd I do it another one today let's start out today with a little bit of phthalo blue and the 2 inch brush be right back her right back there we are and alizarin crimson phthalo blue and alizarin crimson we'll just put a happy little scare maybe tell you what listen maybe live to a happy little barn today what the heck let's just drop in a quick little sky here just very very easy little sky just using little crisscross strokes start at the top work all the way across and then work progressively downward that way it'll mix with a liquid white and automatically your scowl get lighter and lighter toward the horizon and that's exactly what we're looking for okay now we just use long horizontal strokes blend that rascal out and that easy and that fast we have pretty good looking little sky okay now then let's have a let's have a little cloud up here what the heck we're going to take some titanium white on the one inch brush you could use you can use a two inch brush or fan brush I'll just use a one inch brush since it's handy now then let's do some very simple little clouds all I want to do is just tap in some basic little shapes just tap them get a little more color on my brush there we go that's all you're doing just tap I just think thank how you want your little cloud to look give him a very basic shape very basic shape now if you have trouble making your paint stick and the least least little touch of liquid white but in very very small amount because when you put the liquid white on there you lose a lot of your ability to blend because the paint's not firm anymore now very lightly very lightly just caress the canvas blend it a little bit there we go and we have a happy little cloud that easy to I just go back that same old dirty brush I started with I'm gonna go right down here and take some of the little lavender color that a head reach over here and get a little quiet I wanna lighten it up quite a bit maybe a little touch of the dark CNN it there oh that's nice but just tap the brush maybe far far away back here there's some little tree indications I want a very soft very muted faraway all we're doing is just tapping with a brush just happen some very very basic shapes we're certainly not looking for detail here there we go there just a little background shapes may be livin here is a few little things just barely can see this but then you're all done they'll be quite nice you'll like them there okay now then Ned and take a clean brush this is very dry be sure it's dry and just tap the base of those little trees that'll create the illusion of mist we will have let's have a winter day today maybe we'll have a barn and winter that sounds good all right okay that quick that gives us up just a nice little background so let's begin thinking about our barn let's start out with we just use plain old Van Dyke Brown pull the pain out as flat as you can get it take the knife just cut across and get that small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife now then we have to start off and make some big decisions here where does our barn live maybe you just make a decision maybe right in here maybe there'd be like an old silo thing out here right about here we just make up a basic line where we want this to go maybe he's about this wide and all we're looking for here is just basic shape just really push in some color and a little dark sienna to that and a ground dark Santa now then I won't take the small knife and just begin rubbing this rubbing it it'll become very soft and very smooth it looks almost like it was done with a brush there we wipe off the excess paint but rub it there we go okay now then maybe must put some maybe there's some snow up on this little thing let's go back up here let's go head up in here maybe let's touch right here pull down soon just sort of the side where that's gonna be and just drop it in a little bit right over in here pull it tell you what maybe maybe this one's got our little door it comes out here wherever you want it all kinds of little things go back with our brown let's just fill this in there we go to a straight ground and all we're doing right now is just blocking in some basic color you could do this with a shoot you could do this with a paint roller and your way well firm up that edge little there we go just pull it down straighten it out a little I'm going to take a one inch brush and very lightly just pull right over the top of this where we've taken the knife and rubbed it so make it very smooth and very interesting now then let's take and give the indication here and there of a few boards back here all we're doing is taking a small roll of the vendee grip just barely touching barely touching now lightly lightly one here and some air there we go now let's decide where the rest of our old barns gonna live maybe two let's go right up in here maybe it comes down right here and then turns right over over work just wherever you want it I am the other side over here maybe this one comes down like so all right down to about there okay let's put a little maybe this little doer right out here we'll just sketch that in with our knife yeah we want to block all this in with color and I'm just using just basically Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna here and there in it and all we're doing it just blocking in color blocking in color okay tell you what maybe here in there and a little touch of phthalo blue right there that's pretty then look so hot right now but when we go back and begin blending all this together you'll be surprised those little things will make it look like shadows and there and stuff experiment with different colors maybe over here we'll have something come out like that we'll have a roof see there just sort of lay it out lock in the color well I know at home you saying Bob you've really made a mess this time you may be right as rain - there we go okay and once you get this basic color blocked in here now I'm gonna do is take the small knife and just like we did before begin rubbing it continually wiping the knife on paper towel can you pick up some colors like yellow ochre a little yellow ochre in here rub very firmly wipe the knife continually wipe and knife removing that excess paint there we go and at home you have all kind of time you can make this look so in real it's beautiful what you can do just taking this knife and rubbing it making tiny little circles people will think you've worked for long periods of time with a very delicate little brush there and the more you rub it the smoother it becomes just make some beautiful effects beautiful effects there you know one of the questions I'm asked repeatedly is where'd I get all the ideas for these paintings that we do people send me ideas from all over the country this one came from an idea that a lady sent me and if there's things that you want to see painted that we're not painting here drop me a line let me know what it is love to hear from you that's where we get most of these ideas as I said before it's from people writing in telling us what they want to see they're just removing excess paint but at the same time we're pushing that color right into the fabric there okay little bit over here and play with colors like we can take a little dark sienna and I add here and there little lizard crimson shoot just put some of these nice colors wherever you think they should be just break it up a little makes it so much more interesting continually wiping the knife there but we already we have a pretty good basic shape of a bar in there if you want a light spot here there take a little bit of the titanium white and it'll lighten up an area just to rub it in and the small knife seems to work much better than the big knife for this rubbing it has just beautiful things and I'm pushing hard enough that I'm actually bending the blade a little bit it is very flat okay and then let's take let me find a two inch brush we will just use it very lightly just grab this and just pull it gently gently smooths it right out makes a beautiful effect and that neat and you can use this to do all kinds of buildings and wooden structures anything that you want to do it and tell you what let's put let's put pull it Van Dyke Brown out as flat as we can get it cut off the tiniest little roll of paint just right out on the end of the blade now then begin thinking begin thinking about all the board's is in this barn and just sort of let the knife touch the balance just just let it play on there very very little paint's coming off the knife we just want the indication of a lot of little boards we are okay and just wherever you want them wherever you want I like to do paintings like this we travel all over the country and do shows for PBS stations and accepter all over help on whether fundraising activities but we do a lot of paintings like this and they are very very popular and when we travel and do these shows we meet some of the most fantastic people in the country so if we get to your area come out and see us I'd love to spend some time with you and talk to you see some photographs of what you're painting it's a good time for us to get together and just just chew the fat for a while there and I tell you what if you want to know who we're going to be in here drop me a line just give me a name and address and we have a little mailing list that we maintain we'll send you a card when we're going to be in your area you can come out and see us you can just drop it and care the address at the end of the station they'll send it to me okay now then very lightly touch and pull down I just want to sort of bring that together just barely barely touching it shoot that looks like my house about to fall down okay now singing a little line of paint come right up in here maybe right in here there's just a little doer little board right across there see just sort of break it up now all your up there take the knife and we'll put a little little window up there little a little something up there maybe down here let's let's come right down in here and maybe there's a big door down here zoom just like so just straight Van Dyke Brown and this needs to be a big old door so they can get the cow in and out big cow lives here maybe over in here it's a little window see just straight brown maybe there's a smaller one right here just sort of make up little little ideas in your mind volunteers and there's another door old barns they have a lot of doors and windows on them so just put them in wherever you want them shoot maybe over here there's one Terry is that easy okay maybe maybe a window here so we have a whole line of openings now in this thing we take just a little bit of the titanium white and just sort of highlight that just highlight it so they stand out just cut across a little white with your knife just run right over there just make some little rascals jump out at you there can't take you right you know if you were if you're walking in and out of here and taking the cow in and out and it was raining you'd probably get wet so let's put a maybe there's a maybe there was a porch over this old barn or some type of roof up here keep the rain off so we'll just put that on right like that just straight straight Van Dyke Brown okay maybe we need a no rail to hold it up here an old post well that was sort of crooked maybe that old barns about to fall over we'll give him another one right there wherever you want him take a little touch of white give a little highlight so he stands out maybe there's some snow up here to some titanium white on the knife this is gonna be a winter scene maybe maybe Jack Frost has dropped a lot of snow up here yeah that's like so okay I'm gonna straighten that up a little bit don't look too straight I'm not happy with it there we go that's better now I tell you what maybe in the background I hear maybe there was a tree or to shoot let's put a tree we'll sneak right in there where we put the snow on the roof we use a little black little crimson let's go right up in here maybe there we are let's have a little evergreen it lives back here behind this barn there he comes right down to the roof we'll give him a little friend shoot right there there we are it will take another fan brush I'm gonna dip it into a little bit of liquid white liquid whites only to thin the titanium white then I'll go up here and get a little bit of the phthalo blue they loo blue liquid white titanium white let's put some highlights on these so pretty they little blue and white we'll just make those little rascals just really stand out beautiful little tree upper there we go yeah we can come back now let's put some snow up here on the roof shoot a little titanium white just that little roll of paint and let's just bring it right down just following the roofline there it comes you touch it by loading that little roll of paint on your knife it'll come right off there just like so maybe over here OOP there we go right down this side and over here tell you what I must do here let's just make this all covered with snow this is a another part of the roof over here maybe it comes out down there man let's take I have a little tiny bit of that a little blue and white left here we'll take the least little roll of that on the knife tiny little bit and right along the edges here we're just going to put a little bit of that blue and white just to make it look like the snows thick little Enda here just a little shadow under here makes him Sparkle there we go okay we can even add a little that blue and white right into there wherever you wanna just think about where there'd be some little shadows and some little things happening in there and that's where you put it okay now let's have some snow in the background right on the ground I didn't add a super nice easy little way to make a fantastic barn shoe that works to just take a little the white on the fan brush let's go back here and decide where a snows gonna be maybe it lives right there I just paint that in there we go dang maybe there's a let's come right in here maybe got a pickle mound of snow there a snowdrift that's blowed up there we go and a cold winter ran this old barn better get your coat out it's getting colder in studio here already even right along here put a little bit of snow right back here so it looks like it's behind the barn take a little of the blue and white I want to create the illusion of a little shadow behind here little bump there there we go and where you want the snow to be cooler in shadows add a little bit a little blue just a tiny tiny bit don't need much there okay now sometimes sometimes it's fun just to have a little tree here and there so I'll take the liner brush a little paint thinner Van Dyck Brown then the paint down to it's almost like ink maybe the lives right behind laying here maybe there's an old tree will have incoming right from behind there there he is putting a little man arm here and there there we go if you have trouble making your paint flow add a little more of the paint thinner chances are the paint's just not thin enough and it helps if you get a little nervous twitch as you make all kinds of beautiful little limbs there that little tree lives right back there behind the barn maybe back in here you can make out the indication of just a few little tree trunks and some things that are we back in the distance here there we are even though on this side maybe there's a maybe there's a little something Jinxy right in there okay I'm gonna add just a tiny bit of highlight right around this opening up this is where he puts the hay in up here right in there make it stand out maybe it's even a little bit of snow hanging on the side there you take the liner brush and just really make some of this stuff so nice just take your time and head details as I've mentioned before if I go with 30 minutes here they get a little upset with me there okay well we got a nice-looking little bar and go in here maybe let's have some fun shoot we're doing good let's have some fun we take just plain titanium white on the fan brush maybe in here maybe there's a little he'll soon just plain white so there's a little variation in color there because that color right behind their head a little bit of blue in it so this will stand out but just plain titanium white tell you what I know I know maybe there's a maybe there's an old fence here let's take plain Van Dyck Brown cut us off a little roll of paint and our fence is going to live in our world right there maybe there's another little duplet they're saying just drop them in maybe there is one old fence right out here in front of the front of the bar and there's another one I said right there's a good place for one yeah then I'll take a little bit of white a little bit of dark sienna mix it together but leave it marble like I don't overmix then we'll go up here touch put the indication here and there a little bit of highlight on that just like so just touch it give it a little pull maybe on the top up here there's a little snow suit there we are and maybe there's some wire still left in there we just go right through the Van Dyck Brown with a knife and let's just decide where our wire lives there we go that easy just use the heel of the night for the the back point of the knife press very firm and just literally put your wire wherever you want it just cut it in there look fantastic we have three strands got to keep that maybe there's a little sheep it lives and there we got to keep him in there rascal to get away on you I'm gonna take a little dark sienna on the fan brush let's have some fun here little dark Sienna okay maybe there's a little grassy things that grow out here just take the brush push make it Bend upward just push it firmly maybe there's all kinds of little grassy things this guy didn't cut his yard he's like me I'm the world's worst yard keeper a little bit over here to there maybe there's a little bump there wherever you are just just sort of make a big decision drop them in off you go have some fun take the fan brush allowed to pick up a tiny bit of that color and pull it out that way it looks like shadows coming down just automatically there okay our liner brush a little paint thinner and go right back into that dark sienna and let's just pop up a few little few little sticks and twigs and all those things wherever you want them I think we're about ready okay why don't we bring the camera right up here and we'll take a contact paper off and let you see this now what I didn't tell you was before I started this I put a design on the canvas so when we take the contact paper off now we have a beautiful pattern and the way I made this was I just took a piece of metal I found at a building supply store had all these little things cut out laid it on the canvas and took a can of spray paint and just sprayed it it makes a very very nice effect you can do it with any color or anything that you want let's take a little red sign this one and we'll call it finished hope you've enjoyed this it's a little different give you a whole different thing you can do with your little ovals and contact paper it's a lot of fun tell you what from all of us here happy painting and god bless you you
