you hello I'm Barbara Ross and I'd like to welcome you to the 11th joy of painting series first of all let me thank you for inviting me back into your home's again if this is your first time with us let me extend a personal invitation you to drag out your paints and paint along with us each week or just pull up the Oh easy chair and spend a relaxing half-hour as we play some of nature's masterpieces on canvas we use a few big brushes and a dozen colors or so and I'll show you how to create some of the most fantastic paintings you've ever seen in just a few minutes so I tell you what let's going up to the canvas here and get started now the canvas has been covered with liquid white and liquid white just makes the canvas wet makes it slick it allows us to actually blend color on the canvas so let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to do the painting with me and they'll come across in the same order as I have them on my palette while they're doing that let's go ahead and get started today I'll start with a two inch brush go right into a little bit of the phthalo blue and just mix a little bit on the brush just tap it right into the color and I'll reach right up here and grab a little black so we're going to have phthalo blue and midnight black black and blue black and blue all right let's go right up to the canvas now and today let's just dance in a happy little sky we'll just do a little fun painting and just sort of let the brush just bounce around and play let it have fun just relax and enjoy see they're that easy and easy just make little X's little crisscross strokes there I had a little more color to my brush we'll go right on over here and notice we're not covering this guy entirely we're gonna leave a few little areas open a little happy spaces in the sky then we'll come back and we'll put some happy little clouds in there just like so and because we have the liquid right on the canvas as we blend downward the liquid white mixes with a color and automatically you sky gets lighter toward the horizon this will help create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting they're just like soft hmm now we have the old brush dirty here I'm gonna go right back into some of the same color blue and black black and blue that's the way I look when I argue with my wife black and blue mad it may be in this painting maybe we'll have a happy little stream sort of wanders down here so decide basically where your little streams going to be and we just go right in here isn't that easy it's back and forth drop in a little bit of color and we don't care where it goes you could paint you can paint the whole thing here if you want to it didn't make any difference this back and forth this is also a good way to clean off the excess paint this on your brush there okay what let me wash my brush and we wash your brush with odorless paint thinner and I really recommend you use odorless dinner there's a scream in the bottom I can that I scrub the brush against shake off the excess and then do that and they just beat the dev letter and if you've watched me before you know this is the fun part of this whole painting technique now then with a good clean dry brush I'm gonna go right back up in here and generalist and blend this guy out be sure your brush is dry though we want to keep this paint as firm and thick as possible on the canvas one of our golden rules is that a thin paint will stick to a thick paint then too thick so we start out with paint that's very firm and very thick and then on top of that we can add layers of thin paint and that's the only way that you can paint this wet-on-wet technique there we go down here we just blend that out a little bit all right yeah there let's have some fun I'll take a one inch brush and I'm going into titanium white and just pull that brush through the titanium white now reach down here and get a least a little touch of bright red be very careful with this priority lead up your whole world in one heartbeat load a lot of pain into the brush okay let's go ahead up here now you have to make some big decisions where where is the little clouds live in your world baby maybe there's a little cloud eight lives right here and he floats around the sky just has fun all day clouds are very free and when you paint clouds remember that they're free they just float around paint on that way in your mind's eye think think like a cloud just think like a cloud and just sort of let it float around see this flew out any yep you're right there's one right there right there and you're painting you put as many or as few clouds as you want I just want to show you how to make a big old cloud and how many of you make is up to you maybe over here on the other side a little bit maybe there's one don't want this side to be left out it's a happy little cloud that lives right there there yes just drop them in don't overwork drop them in put another one right there just make a big decision beside were you on him and put your cloud right in there all right they had quick we have the cloud now with a good clean dry brush we want to blend the base of these clouds out without touching the top so tiny little circles just barely touching and using just the corner of the brush tiniest little circles Danny say Yossi don't overwork be lazy this is one of the times that you really need to just to take your time do a little bit and get away from it the more you work the more your clouds going to go away and leave you there just just mix it up a little bit stirred wrap the brush one time there and when I beat the brush I just removes excess paint without going through the whole cleaning procedure so now then we're going to come back up here and we're going to fluff this cloud grab it and this is very light very delicate three hairs and some air barely touch lift it up lift it up lift it up and always do business circular strokes you go straight up it's gonna look like you gonna look like you this guy has rain going up and it's it is that's sort of distracting so I always do it sort of in circular strokes just like so and that simple you have some fantastic little clouds isn't it fun okay I think today let's let's build us a little mountain in this painting I I lived in Alaska for many many years and I love mountains I'll show you how to make like let's take a little bit of a midnight black we'll take some Van Dyck Brown a little touch of alizarin crimson just a little crimson and some Prussian blue don't put too much crimson unless you want purple mountains in it there's nothing wrong with purple mountains fact I'll add a more crimson and get them a little taller purplish side seems like they wrote a beautiful song about purple mountains pull it out very flat take your knife and cut across so you get that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife okay let's go up here now then you have to make a big decision where does your mountain live in your world and you just take your knife and you begin deciding where your mountain lives and drop him in just drop him in there see how easy that it the only thing we're worried about is this nice outside edge we could care less what's happening inside here just looking for the outside edge push that pain in very firm at this point and scrape off all the excess just really scrape it off okay now that would take a 2 inch brush grab that paint and pull it pull it that does two things it removes the excess paint and it allows it to get lighter toward the base and that's what make your mouth is so pretty there it comes and then just blend it right into nothing that easy now Dennis have some let's have some more fun we'll put some snow on that mountain take some of the titanium white and once again pull it out as flat as you can get it just get strong with it cut across and you have that literal of paint and it needs to be right out on the edge of the knife okay let's go fear that it start but to point a knife there and just pull it down right just pull down there a little bit right there just sort of determine where you think light would hit on your mountain there and if the lights coming from the right then you want the light to be more over here but you have to make these big decisions this is your world and you have to design it the way you want we can take a little edge of the knife and go write a myth and a little bit man and then let's put some shadows for shadows oh let's use let's use a little bit of blue and white not like so sometimes I don't that I want to change to the small knife you'll find a small knife is excellent for getting in little tight areas so same way little roll of paint let's go right up here Haley no pressure absolutely no pressure you want this paint to break to have all those little all those little holes in it no pressure at all just barely touch barely touch give it a little pull just like so it mountains are a lot of fun and they're quite easy to make there's some basic rules pay very close attention to angles have it just keep using that little knife we go right in here watch here maybe there's a little valley lives right in here make up little stories think about in your world what your mouth looks like they do a little Valley comes right around like so there he comes we sort of play the highlight in the shadow back and forth and bring it together here see that wherever you want to go that's where it should go maybe this comes right on out I'm back and you could just keep on going till you cover up your entire campus with mountains which is an excellent way to practice so if you ever do that don't worry about it you have lost nothing and you've learned if there's any secret to this technique or any other technique it's practice just spend some time practicing it doesn't take much but yeah you have to devote that time okay now that I want to create the illusion of mist at the base of this mountain so with a large brush this is a clean brush what I'm going to do is tap following the angles here just tap and over here tap a little bit this way give it a little lift like so there we go and in here we can sort of just pull this together see how easy that is you can do it you really can do it there's no big secrets here I'll show you how to do it all you need is just to grab your canvas and some paint jump up here and do it and it's fun okay we'll just take we had some mountain color left over here let's add a little bit of I'll add a little touch of SAP green right into the same mountain color so we have black blue brown vision crimson eyes we'll mix up a pretty good pile of paint here and we can come in hand have some fun I'm gonna get the old fan brush and we load the fan brush now I'm gonna make some little evergreens we back in the distance now you could make these with a one-inch brush fan brush 2 inch brush anything anything it works you could even make them with a knife load the brush full of paint look at the amount of paint to send that brush it's really full okay let's go right up here now then maybe there's some evergreen trees that live back here touch take just the corner of the brush there and there they are these little these little trees live right in your fan brush all you have to do is just sort of push them out they're that easy that easy and as many or as few as you want and sometimes show you a little trick show you a little trick it's fun if you have a bunch of evergreens you don't want to sit and make each one independently you can just gob on a bunch of color just drop in a whole bunch of color I'll tell you what let's have some on the other side too we don't want it that yeah all we're doing here is just tapping in the same dark color and I'll show you what you can do with that why I know you say and already Bob you you can mess this one up you may be right maybe right since the only thing that you're really worried about Meisel evergreens is the tops you can put all that in at one time and then come back and all you have to do is decide where the tops live there you go there's a matter one and you can turn this into a whole forest if you want to as many or as few as you want just drop them in now we'll put some highlights on these trees and that's where you'll separate them that's where they'll become individuals maybe there's some way back here and all you see is just little indications just little tops you don't see a whole bunch of a detail just little indications just here in there then we come back wicked elbows as I say you could paint an entire forest in just a few minutes just a few minutes there's one name is theta they're just dropping right in there and you will push a little color into there you can even grab and pull up to make them look like they're really really really far away these are sort of gives the illusion these are closer and those are farther away and once again that's one of those little tricks that helps create the illusion of depth from distance in your painting and of course we're not interested in that happy bug but should you be this is what sells your paintings I get so many fantastic letters from people all over the country that are painting they're having unbelievable success and they're selling their work and the the selling of the work is not important what's important is the fact that someone is willing to pay you for something you created out of your mind with your hand it does a wonderful things the ego forget about the pocketbook that's not important it's really not important it's what it does to your heart it's what it does to your confidence I can remember oh maybe 25 years ago when I sold my first painting and I think I only got about that $20 for it and I paid that much for the frame that was on it but I went home it gave me so much confidence I went home and probably painted 25 more paintings that I couldn't give away but it was a fact that somebody wanted my painting enough to pay me for it really inspired me to paint and it'll do the same thing for you okay well I got a dark color going here same old color I'm just going to begin adding in some little things like it all I'm doing is tapping down with a two inch pressure just tap damage now we begin making some decisions here where is our land going to be and you need dark in order to show light so all we're doing here just adding some dark color we're going to come back and highlight everything separate all this bring it all together down like so whatever whatever wherever you want it and we get a little more paint here losing the blacks and the Browns and the greens and just mix it with a brush yeah you're right right there there's another little thing and that easy you could begin creating the lay of the land by lay of the land I mean the way that lay the land flows just how it flows this is another one those big decisions you have to make in your world how does it how does the Lynn is it a lot of bumps in it smooth hilly flat if you're going to put water in your painting as you know it's better to have a recessed area because water goes to a lower area does it it won't stay up on top it goes down to the lowest area waters like me or it's lazy it looks for the easiest way to flow so you need to indicate that the land is higher than the water or going to look right there and you could have really done this with a paint roller would it work just as well okay yeah we can come back and begin putting in some of the little detail things that the fun things I'm gonna take some dark Sienna Sarek Sienna a little bit of white touch it up blue not much blue okay pull it out real flat again cut across once again that little tiny role of paid that's so important okay now they may be back in here we can see a few little tree trunks just hearing that maybe you can't see one at every tree and you can just cut through the paint and let some of the white of the canvas show through create the indication of hundreds of little sticks and twigs and people think you work for weeks to it all that don't you tell them any different that's our secret there we go don't let the cat out of the bag okay trunk in this tree and then just touch the canvas will pull off what it wants give you back what's left it's that easy however many it's up to you it's really up to you painting offers you freedom creative freedom I spend half my life in the military this is where this is where I made Bob's world this is where I came when I wasn't playing soldier this is where I came and found peace we wash your brush here there shake it off there you go alright I get carried away without brushing before I get into that I'm going to take same old dirty brush and go right into the yellow at this this brush had the blue and the green on so when I go into yelling we'll get a dark green don't you have to clean the brush ok let's go back up here let's just drop in indication of a few highlights just on these trees and all I'm doing is touching and pushing down with a little bit you don't want to put too much in here and kill all that beautiful dark color if you kill all that then you trees gonna look flat just just touch it go just a little every brings are quite dark marmalade and if you watch the shows before you know we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents you learn how to work with anything and everything it happens a little bit on this whole big tree right here a little later there we are just some happy little things there now let's have some fun I'm gonna go right into the CAD yellow with a 2 inch brush and I'm tapping you see how it's tapping grab a little SAP green there was a little green and we're going to some yellow ocher would touch the Indian yellow we mix all of these in the brush okay let's go ahead up here now big decision time by tapping downward right on top of that dark we can begin creating a nice soft grassy area is that easy tell you what tell you what let's have some fun maybe back in here let's put a happy little butcher to use the one-inch brush and let's just push in look at there see happy little Bush lives right back in here and against these trees turns like so maybe we'll put one on the other side our deck we don't want him left out and you can put a lot or a few none sort up to you whatever whatever and back to our two-inch brush and let's begin putting all this in all you're doing here is tapping just gently gently gently gently tap there we go see how you can create different planes and the whole lay of the land that easy and easy just let it fall right off your brush every once in a while I'm going to touch at least a little bit of the bright red just to spark lit up a little fire in there and all these different planes helps you deputy distance in your painting there we go and the more you tap this the softer it will become it will get very very soft let's go over here and the other side we're going on left out see how easy just tap but the lay of the land the angles are the most important thing here don't lose sight of that here's a big old buck comes down and comes around just like yeah saying if you want to show a different plane lighten the color a little and drop it in just layer after layer after layer I would strongly suggest you start in the background and work forward that's sort of a good rule of thumb and this style of painting I always start the thing as father's doing and work forward and I think you'll find it works works much easier for you that way now that lets take with this use of one-inch brush here whatever you have I want to just pull some of this color down just pull it down just pull the straight down and you can create all kinds of things and we just go across it makes reflections I'm going to put make this like moving water but even in moving water there's reflections they're still there I'm going to have a little pond this easy you could create a happy little pond just by pulling the let color down fly across see if you want it and then I'll dip my brush have another fan brush and I have several of each brush I don't have to clean each one dipped it right into the liquid white and I'm going into a titanium white and load the brush quite full reach up here and put at the least little touch of the a little blue in it now then here comes our little stream this is not a fast stream maybe before the series over we'll do a fast stream this is just one that sort of is like me it's lazy it just wanders along here it has a good time just like so and you just sort of scrub this brush across but you want to keep these lines basically straight basically straight and this is how you cut off the bottom of your landmasses bring it all together just like so see how easy that is and you can do it you really can do it wherever get right on out through here see allowed to pick up some of that color and it all blends together like so so there's to us in that fun I really hope you've enjoyed this painting the old clock on the wall is telling me it's about time that how to bring this one to a close for the day it's been a lot of fun certainly enjoyed being with you and I hope you've enjoyed the painting from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless you you
