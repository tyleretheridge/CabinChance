- Hi. Welcome back. I'm glad you could join me again today. Today, I thought we'd do somethin' that's a lot of fun and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Before we get started here, let's have 'em run all the colors that you need across your screen And they'll come across your screen in the same order that I
have 'em on my palette. Starting with the Titanium White and working around. And while they're doin'
that, let's go up here and I'll explain what I've done already. I have a black canvas
today, as you can see. And we make these black canvases by covering them with a flat, black acrylic paint, and allowing it to dry. And then I've taken, and I've
made some stripes in here. I've just taken Alizarin Crimson in a couple of places. Little bit of Thalo Blue. Little bit of Prussian Blue. And down in here, I've put
the smallest little amount of Thalo Green. Just sort of mix these on your brush and just sort of let 'em happen. Wanna do somethin' that's
a little bit different? I think you'll find it fun. I'm gonna start with a little
Magic White on my brush. Just a small amount of Magic White. And decide where your horizon's gonna be. And we'll just start making
little criss cross strokes. And the Magic White will begin picking up all of these beautiful colors. It's just unbelievable what happens. Use very little of the Magic White. You can always go back in
and add a little bit more. But it's a son of a gun to take it out. Just start with a small amount and blend upward. And then we can just
begin making all kinds of beautiful little shapes
and stuff in the sky. Let your brush play and have fun. Let it go. Let it go. There we are, look at what's happening. Now it's beginning to hit the crimson and the Thalo Blue and the Prussian Blue. These are really exciting paintings. And if you need a little
more of the white, come down here and pick it up. And just pull it right on up into the sky. Let it go, let it go, have fun. It's what it's all about. And you can blend the sky
to any degree that you want. And let's say you can go
back and pick up a little more of the Magic White if you want it. And you can add it in. And all you're doin' is picking up the color that's underneath. And you can keep adding Magic White 'til this looks like it's, it could be noon if you want it to be. Noon, or it could be
late in the afternoon, early in the morning. When you're painting, you
use that artist's license that says you can do anything. And you have to make
these fantastic decisions. This just looks very very gently. Blend all it up. It just takes the brush strokes out and lets you see what you have. Here we go. You see, that quick, you
have a light horizon, that sky gets darker. Already, it produces the illusion of distance and depth in the painting. Let's clean the old brush here. This is the fun part of this technique. Shake off the excess. There you go. You cover two or three friends. Alrighty, now, we got
our sky and lets start back in here. We'll mix up a color. Today I'm gonna make, let's see, Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red. Let's put some Prussian Blue in there. Prussian Blue is very dark, very strong. So we have Permanent Red, Van Dyke Brown, and Prussian Blue. We want a color here
that almost looks black. Very dark, very strong,
but it's still brown. We don't over-mix our colors here. Just pick it up 'n turn it over. And that's enough. Now then, clean the knife. And let's start today
with the old 2 1/2" brush. I'm just gonna tap. Just tap the brush right up into that. Now let's go up to the canvas. Now I want to come right
along the horizon line here. And I'm just gonna take the brush, see? Just tap. Just let these things happen. As you pick up the Magic White, your color's gonna get lighter in value. And that's exactly what you want it to do. Because a light's shining
through back here. Maybe there's a little,
happy little hill right here. There we go. Little more of the color. And you can just begin laying all of these beautiful little things in here. See, I told ya this was
gonna be a fun painting. Maybe, maybe, way back
here in the distance, maybe there's a little building or two. So I get out the knife, and I'm gonna use this same ol' brown color. Pull that paint out very flat. Just flat as you can get it. And take your knife and cut across. It gives ya that little roll of paint right out on the edge of your knife. OK, let's go up to the canvas Maybe there's a little
bitty house that lives right there. We just want some
indications way back here in the distance. Little house, he lives there. Little barn, little shed, whatever. All we're doin' here is
just layin' in the dark. We'll come back and put
in a few little highlights and fix him all up. Make him nice and pretty. Right now you're trying to
get some dark on your canvas Good. Now let's take a little Titanium White, little brown, make a color that's somewhat lighter than what
we have on the canvas. And you don't wanna mix this color dead. Add a little blue to it and gray it down. Now we use the small edge
of the knife this time. Same way, small edge. And it's just a little bit of paint right out there on the
small edge of the knife. Good. Let a little light just bounce and play right along there. Just like so. I don't wanna lot of color on this. Just enough so it stands out and it's lighter than the side. I want the side to be very dark. It's in shadow. The ol' shadow's gotta, there we go. And maybe, right along this edge here, a little light plays right through there. There, good, just to make
that little edge stand out. There we go. Maybe there's some boards in there. We just cut through. And I know somebody's sayin', "Well, you gotta have a door in there so you can get into the ol' shed." Well, OK. Give you a door. Cut around it. There we are, and that quick,
we have a little building. Now we can just clean up his foots. Touching. Bringing some grass right up around him. Maybe over here, right there, right there. I'm gonna tell you what let's do, Let's build us a happy little
barn that lives right there. We'll come this way now. And then let it drop over. Sorta visualize these things in your mind. Put 'em on the canvas. Put 'em on the canvas. And these are far away, they're small. So we're not worried
about tremendous detail. Fill this one in just
like we did the other one. We need that dark color
so the light'll show. Little edge of the knife. ♫ Doo-doo♫ There. Pull some of this down. And all we're doin'
here is tryin' to cover the canvas with dark color. Now, take a little Permanent Red and Van Dyke Brown. I'll just mix it together real quick here. Like so. I'll put some shingles
up here on this roof. Just touch. Start at the bottom and work up. This is just the way they
put shingles on a roof, too. Start at the bottom and work up. So they overlap each other. And that'll give you an indication
of a few little shingles. A little highlight along the edge. Right along there. And down. Once again, we need a little
highlight on the front here. OK. The old barn here needs a door. Big door. This is where the cattle had to go in. Smooth that out. Little bit o' color around the edges. There we are. There. Now maybe, this old
farmer, maybe he's like me. I never have enough room. Let's give him a shed
out here on his barn. He needs a little shed. Maybe this is where the chickens live. Chickens need a place to live too. Put a little board or two right there. There we go. Little bit more of this roof color. Was a Permanent Red with
a little Van Dyke Brown. Just put some indications right there. And that quick, we have an indication of a happy little barn back here. Now let's put some more dark Now this part of the
canvas down here is dry. I only put color on the top. Now we can begin goin'
into a little bit of the Titanium White here and there. And we'll put a little highlight here. Just let these little things happen. Wherever you think they should be. Wherever. And we can begin creating
the lay of the land. Now, maybe up in here, we'll just do this. Make it look like an old path went around through there, same color. This whole program'll be done with just about the same
colors all the way through it. Little highlight on that. And, with a large brush, we can very quickly just drop in some happy little things here. All I'm worried about now is just putting paint on the canvas. Little bit over here. There we go. Just let it go. You know, one thing we've
mentioned over and over again, if you enjoy this show,
call your PBS station or drop 'em a line. Let 'em know. They wanna know what you like. If you wanna see reruns, if you wanna see these paintings again. Once again, they need to know. Then when they need
some help, help 'em out. They bring ya some fantastic programming. Some beautiful shows about the animals and nature. And they need some help once in a while. There we go. Now that's just got the
whole bottom covered. We can put in a little path. This is still just a brown color. There we go. Now we have a little path,
pushes everything back. I think we use a happy fan brush. I'm just gonna go right
into a small amount of Titanium White and brown. White and brown. There we go. Just mix it on your brush. A lot of paint. Let's go up here. Now, we can begin putting in some details. Some nice little grassy areas. And all we want is just
little indications back here. I don't wanna lot of
color in this painting. Now, when you're doing this at home, if you wanna put a lotta color in it, drag out your artist's license and you do anything that you wanna do. I just wanna show you how to make it. How you do it is your world. It's your painting, so
you do what you want. There. You can put a few of those over here. Just to brighten it up. Let everything show. Boy, this does look like
a deserted old barn. There. Alright, tell you what,
right there, there's one. You have to make a decision where your path is. And you can put as much of this
in or as little as you want. A lot of times on TV here, I try to make things a little bit brighter so they stand out better for you at home. But if you want to make
it a little softer, a little quieter, certainly you can. Just use a color that's a
little more muted and quiet. I tell you what. I tell you what, let's
have some fun today. Maybe there's an old windmill here. We'll have some real fun. Now, a super way to make a windmill. I wanna take my liner brush and just use the back of it here. And, first of all, I'm
gonna draw a circle. I'm just scratching the
circle on the canvas. I don't even know if you can
see that or not. (scratching) And another circle. (rough scratching) If you can't see it, I'm
sure you can hear it. There you are, yeah, you can see it. Now we need to put some blades on there. So let me mix up more
of that Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, Prussian Blue. Just mix it up, we need
a good dark brown here. Now these are super little scenes to make. On a white canvas though,
they are day scenes. Good. Now we pick up that small
roll of paint again. Always usin' that small roll of paint. Just go up here. Remember that the blade's wider at the top than it is at the bottom. So you touch, and sorta
go bloop, like that. And that's how we make our little blades. And let's do like that. Look-a there, look-a there. And over here. There. And one here, touch, and sorta pull it around. Now if you do these four first, then all you have to
do is come back in here and you can lay in all the rest of 'em and they'll work out correctly. Isn't that sneaky? And you can make beautiful windmills. Beautiful windmills, there you go. I lived in Nebraska for a long time and there were a lot of windmills there. Look-a there, look-a there. Now, the circle that you made up here, something has to connect all these blades. So you can cover up that
line that you scratched by takin' your knife, little edge. See? And that just brings 'em all together. You gotta have a connector
here to hold all these together or they fall off. Look-a there. Come right on around. Just like so. However many you want. I'm gonna use some of that red and brown and let's put just a touch of highlight right here on the corner. Maybe a little more of
the Permanent Red into it, little brighter so it stands out and you can see it a little better. All you do is touch. Just touch, just so there's a little color on that edge and you can see it. Now, if you were doing
this on a white canvas, you'd probably want a lot more color. There we go, just to give you an idea. Now then, there usually
is a couple o' big blades that stick out here and
that's what the wind catches. That guides it. So we just come right over the top here. 'Cause these old windmills
had to turn into the wind. So we'll put in these. And the old windmills that I've looked at usually have two of 'em on it. And they sort of go to the center. We'll put a little tiny highlight on that. Bloop, there we are. Look at that, wow. Then we need somethin' to
bring it all together here. And there's usually a cross like so. In there, good. A little highlight on
that too so it stands out. You can see it. There's the little thing
where the chain goes. And a little platform up here. Now we need some legs to hold all this up. That platform's where
the bird always comes and builds his little nest. And he sits up there and
he watches the farmer. And when the farmer feeds
the chickens and stuff he slips down there and gets
himself something to eat too. Same brown color. And we gotta give this old windmill a leg. Don't want him to fall over. Give him a leg. And this is closer to ya so
respectively, it's much bigger. There we go. And let's give him another leg here. See we don't use any
patterns, so nobody knows we make a mistake or not. OK, there, another leg right here. Gotta have four foots or he'll fall over. Now, if you don't have
windmills where you're at, and you wanna paint a windmill, there's a thousand books that have beautiful, beautiful pictures. And you can pick up one
of those and look at it. There we go. That gives us four foots. And usually in here,
there's a little platform. So we'll just make a little platform. Then bring this leg over
the top of the platform. And we need some supports in here to hold all this together. Like so. Maybe there's another one right here underneath the platform. Like that. We need some little
steps so the old farmer can climb up there and shoot that bird off if he wants to that's livin' up there. Just drop them in. Now we can go back to our highlight color. And let's just lay the tiniest little bit of highlight here. Just so this stands out
a little better for you. Tiny little bit. There we go. Little bit over in here. This sorta separates everything and makes it look a little better. Little touch right there. Little bit right on that. Nice! If you get one that's
nice, don't touch it again. Leave it alone 'cause it
may never come out again. Now let's take the liner brush. I want to use the liner brush right now. Into that, paint thinner
to thin the paint. And I'm gonna go right in to
that same ol' brown color. Turn that brush, bring it
to a nice, sharp point. Turn it. Bring it right up 'til
it's nice and sharp. Liner brush has very long bristles. Let's go up here. Now then, we need some
support brackets in here. So we'll just come right down. There. This reminds me the way the teacher used to grade my paper in school. I needed a lot of support brackets I guess cause she made a lot of
these things on my paper. And you can just put some
of these here and there. However many you want. Windmills, they all serve
the same basic purpose. But the old farmers, they all built 'em to their specifications, however they wanted 'em or whatever was layin' around
the farm to build 'em with. Now we can cover up their little foots. Like so. All kinds of nice little things. Now, while I've got
this brown on my brush, maybe back here there's
a happy little tree that lives right here. We'll make him far away
so he's not very big. Just a happy little tree. And, I tell you what, this is fun. Let's put a little fence here, you can see in the background. Just like so. Come across. You could always put a
little tree here and there. Yeah, this farm is definitely deserted. Now, let's take the old big brush. And I'm just gonna pull it right through this brown. Just load it by pulling. I'm just gonna pull the corner through. And don't be afraid of this big brush. Let's go back up here. Big brush will do nice thing for ya but you need to make friends with it. Here, I'm just touching
the canvas, just touch. And we'll put some happy little leaves right out here. See there, how easy that is? Just drop 'em in, wherever you want 'em. Little bit down here at his foots. Now we can just put all kinds of detail. And when you're at home and the old clock doesn't get you like it does me here, you can just build all kinds of beautiful things into it. Put a touch o' highlight right there so that little strap
holds everything together. Shows up a little better
so you can see it. Little bit out here on these ends. Just a touch. Just a touch. And you can put as much
detail in yours as you want. There we go, I think we've got a pretty wild old windmill here. I'm gonna take a fan brush,
little bit of the white on it. And very lightly, very lightly we'll complete our little path. Smooth it out a little. And then I think we're
about done with this one. Let it come right up to the door. Do this like so. Fan brush does fantastic things. This is really just a little
bit of Titanium White on it. And that's all. Bring all that together. Use my liner brush again
and put a few little things right around the foots of this windmill. Cause there were weeds,
they grow higher here. Just a few little happy things. Going like so. There we go. And we can put all kinds
of little sticks and twigs. And as they go further back, let 'em get smaller and
smaller and smaller. Helps build the illusion of distance into your painting. Pick up a little of that white like so and we're in business. There comes a time when you can literally piddle a painting to
death, so I'm gonna stop. Let's take a little thin
oil, a little Permanent Red. I like the oil because it's very slick. It works well on your canvas. Turn that brush. Bring it to a super-sharp point. This paint is literally like water. You can see it literally running. OK, let's go up to the canvas here. And then we can sign this painting. There. And I really hope you've enjoyed this. It's a little different
than what we've done in the past. And I hope it gives you a lot of ideas. Sets your imagination on fire. If you've enjoyed this one, let us know. We'll do some more crazy things for ya. From all of us here: Happy Painting. God bless. ("Interlude" by L. Owens)
