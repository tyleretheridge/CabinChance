you welcome back I'm glad you could join me today you know we get hundreds and hundreds of letters from people all over the country telling us what they like as well as what they dislike about the many shows that we've done one of the most popular things we've done in the past was having my son Steve on several of the shows we've got hundreds of letters praising his work so I thought we would bring him back today and let you spend another half hour with Steve and let him paint a beautiful painting for you so I'm going to turn it over to Steve I'll be back at the end of the show and we'll see what he does do you I guess the best way to show you is just to start right in with it I've already put a coating of liquid white on the canvas previous Lee so now I'll start out with a little bit of alizarin crimson tapping it into the brush always got to tap your paint in that gives you a nice even distribution of paint and I'm gonna start right in the center here always using an X pattern that gives your sky plenty of movement right now just looking for a basic shape don't want to make it anything special and maybe still with a dirty brush I'll go into a little bit of pression blue when using a real dark color always start up in the top corner in your sky because if it's lightest in the center here then it should be darker as it expands outward making the corners the darkest and while we've got some paint on our brush we can go ahead and throw in a little water just pulling in from the sides and maybe we can even throw a little bit of that pink reflection back in there now with a clean brush I'm going to go back and blend always blend with a clean dry brush if you go up there with paint thinner in your brush sometimes that whole painting I'll just rip right off the canvas in these areas where there's a lot of thick blue you have to blend with a lot of pressure that's how you break up the colors it should look almost like a sheen of purple in between the blue and the pink and as I blend outward this guy gets more and more misty looking and you can do that same trick down in the water always use the same stroke you used to put it on to blend it and remember pressure is the key when you get into an area like this where you have lots of streaks or like when you're trying to blend the pink out you just mash real hard with the brush send it right on out there now after you get through with that you can use your fan brush I had to get the right choice of fan brushes there we have a number three and a number six I like the number six s cuz you can make big clouds maybe we'll put a little bit of liquid white in there and why not make them pink by adding a little bit of a looser and crimps into the white that makes it match up with a sky a little bit better oh my gosh might be making a mess here whenever you're making clouds the biggest thing you have to remember is to make the light fluffy shapes on the top and keep the bottom nice and flat and when you're making small clouds you want to make a more Stratus type clouds long and thin and when you're making a cloud that's way up high which means it would be further into the distance you can make it larger like this one see all I'm doing is making circles with the fan brush as long as you're making circles you're okay can't get too much easier neck and now just a little bit of blending with a clean two inch brush you want to start blending down in your pink first because if you go up here and blend in your blue and then come down to pink guess what you get dark purple right down there in the middle of your sky and that's a no-no okay once you get the bottom all blend it out and you get the hair out of there you can kind of like make your arm go in circles but yet you're just hitting halfway through the circle and pulling a little straightened out of the cloud and then blend real lightly back and forth okay now with the palette knife I'm going to take a little bit of blue brown and alizarin crimson mix them all together kind of marbled this color together I know you can't tell what it looks like right now but if you take a little bit of white and add it to a separate little amount of it over here then you can tell exactly what color you have that's always a good trick to know now I'm just gonna take a little roll of that on the knife and let's try to get in a basic Mountain shape here Jack we'll go for something crazy and don't spend a lot of time on this mountain shape because it really doesn't matter it's the highlights that are important in the shadows just try to get the basic shape in there that's what makes this method so easy okay scrape it all the way down to bare canvas and then pull out I do 2h and try not to kill all that pink down at the bottom of your Mountain that'll be your nice little misty area as a matter of fact you can take a moderately clean two and a half inch brush and kind of do some of your X's down at the bottom there don't to play with it too long sooner you get to those highlights the sooner you can have fun see I got a little bit of that pink mixed in there and all I'm doing is just barely touching and letting the knife slide across the canvas adding no pressure at all and the shaker you are with it probably the better that's what makes that paint break sometimes it's kind of hard to tell where you're supposed to put your light on a mountain so if you kind of think of it like you were sitting in your room at night and you had your desk lamp shining on a book you were reading and the desk lamp was closer to the right side of the book than the left side then obviously the right side of the book would be lighter and the left side would have a shadow cast it on that's what we're trying to get here the same effect and once in a while you got to change the shape of one of these if you get them all just a like you know you start getting that stairway look or that one two three look you know that's not good so I kind of broke the big one up a little bit with a separate peek over here on the side and right back here we'll just make like a little glacier formation and back here maybe a little something's happened okay now with that base color I can just take a little bit of white and add to that and you come up with your shadow color now you don't want to get your shadow color too dark that's probably one of the biggest mistakes I see people make and like classes and stuff while I'm traveling around teaching I started teaching with my dad about oh I guess I was about 16 years old but even before that when I was about 12 years old one time my dad and I were in a mall and in Alaska where he was stationed in the Air Force and he was trying to make a little money on the side so he got up in front of this group of people and started painting said his easel up and everything started painting and he got to where he had to use the bathroom and I was the only person there other than him so he naturally walked off and said Steve go ahead and finish this painting and here I was in front of 20 or 30 people and I had to stand there and do a painting at 12 years old needless to say I was scared to death but I sold the painting for $60 at the end of it it's probably just luck shadowing is just like highlighting except for you're pulling in an opposite direction see and leave this area in here kind of with some dark in it because the sun's not as close to this point over here as it is over here so try not to destroy all that dark you put on with your basic first coat your basic first mountain shape brother and now I'm just tapping with the 2 inch brush down at the bottom don't come into the top of the mountain just stay right down here at the bottom just kind of pulling and tapping and I'm gonna pull straight up into it just at the bottom see how that pink mist is showing through here I think that's kind of a desirable effect and if you're selling paintings that works out real good too now with the 1 inch brush maybe I'll take a little bit of blue and some brown and maybe a little bit of SAP green too I don't know you kind of have to make the colors up in your mind because as you get better at painting and you learn that there really is no one color there's varieties of the same color but there's no one color really I'm trying to come up with kind of a grayish blue color for the first background foothills here with that tint of SAP green and just with the corner of the one inch brush I'll come in and just make some foothills shapes here again don't worry about this this is just a basic shape now with a clean 1 inch brush you can come back in and pull all these little things up it looks just like distant trees now you have to pull it straight up straight vertical or people get the impression this is like grass blowing in the wind back here but it's awful far in the distance for grass to be showing up so try to make it straight up and look just like little trees and then down at the bottom of that with your 2 inch brush you can mist it a little bit just using a top corner of the brush as a matter of fact most of the use of any brush and this method is with either the corner or the side only using half the brush at one time now underneath that I can make another layer of foothills just by darkening up that same color with a little bit more blue and brown and you want to change the shape of these foothills a little bit make them a little bit closer to the ground a little bit lower you know not as steep so basically all you're doing is just throwing in the shape and coming back and picking it to death after that to get it to look right and once again blending down at the bottom or miss thing as you call it don't be afraid to use these big brushes as a matter of fact sometimes they come in more handy than the small ones even in small areas just got to learn how to use part of the brush rather than the whole thing now down here below that just to kind of cut it off make it look like the foothills aren't just hanging in that air you can take a little bit of Van Dyck Brown you have to get that roll on your knife and come in with a little bit of land and try to bring the land down out of the foothills actually into the painting from out of the foothills it's kind of hard to get this effect because you have to like write it down into the painting bringing everything to the inside of the painting you're always leading a person's eye into it the foothills come into the mountain and this land comes into the water if I was to make the land go up like this instead of around like this then it would look like the lake was going clean off the canvas up like that but it should look like it's a round leg see why make it come around so after you get the brown on you take a little bit of white browning it and come back and highlight this kind of a grayish color and you can take that same old dirty one-inch brush with your same darker Foothill color and tap them in a little bit of grass down here just to break up the top of that land and now underneath the land we can take the 2 inch brush this is probably the funnest part of the whole thing watch how magical this is just grabbing the bottom and pull them right out of the brown you get instant reflections of course keep the height the same in the water as it is up here if it's small here it should be small here if it's huge here the reflection should be huge and then you just go across that rail lightly okay now underneath that you want to use your knife and a little bit of liquid white well we put a little bit of brown in there too just so it doesn't look so dull a rather self white if you put this straight liquid white on there it seems to look like ice or something and this isn't really in the dead of winter so I don't think we want any bright ice on the edges of our land but you're just trying to keep it nice and horizontal okay now I'm gonna wash one of my two-inch brushes since I'd dirty them all up I got to do that some more that's pretty fun he's gonna blend the water in a little bit here now let's see what else to this painting need maybe a couple big trees I'll take a little bit of brown and blue maybe a little bit of green alizarin this that see it really doesn't matter what colors you mix together for certain things as long as it's dark so I try to get a nice variety of color just loading the fan brush to a chisel edge and tapping in kind of from side to side and just make that tree go right on down to the bottom that trees probably gonna get pretty lonely there so maybe I'll make another one right beside it this one will be kind of crooked not every trees straight up and down in the painting and maybe just by smashing in getting the bristles to go down but yet the bristles right here are spraying up on the fan brush and the ones in back moving down so you get kind of little pieces flying up into that painting looks like little grass sprigs flying out there okay now I can go in with a couple trunks using my knife pull it out flat stick it straight down in and pull through and you get that roll on the knife when you come up to the canvas touch touch touch don't bring it all the way down just down to about the halfway point and then I can go in with a little bit of highlighting just using the fan brush a little bit of that bright green and maybe we'll even put some yellow in here sometimes you have to send down your paint with a drop a paint thinner to get it to stick since the thin paint sticks on top thick paint do is touching back and forth not every branch and as you get closer to the bottom the leaves haven't been able to capture as much chlorophyll from the Sun so obviously they're going to be darker but keep them nice and bright up here at the top heck maybe we'll even put in a little bright yellow look at that maybe get a little bit of paint there now I'm going to pull through the cadmium yellow come up to the canvas I've turned the brush over with the heel to the top and I'm just going to touch barely touching and try not to kill all those dark areas those dark areas got to be saved and maybe we'll work with a different color now so I'm yellow ocher and maybe a little bit of this bright red that's almost too bright well maybe we'll even get crazier than that and go for a fireball if you're gonna put red in your painting put it right in the center and maybe a tiny bit out towards the edge just to show that there's not only one Bush that color but you have to have it in the center because red is what draws a person's eye the quickest and you want to leave that eye into the center of the painting so put it right there come back in here maybe we'll have a different shape one and possibly even a little bit of land underneath that it looks kind of bare just using Van Dyck Brown again okay I'm going to highlight that now a little bit of Van Dyke Brown and white and maybe throw a little bit of grass on top of that just to break up that land alone and maybe we'll even go in with a few sticks just here and there and there could even be some up through the trees here just to break up the monotony a little bit yeah I think I'll sign that one with my liner brush and some bright red we always use bright red to sign you want the buyers I attracted to your painting as well as your signature so if you use red to sign your paintings you don't ever have to worry about nobody's seeing it because it shows up good well hi Steve Tseng is painting I'd like to step in here and thank him very much for being with us today we've certainly enjoyed seeing what he could do in just a couple of minutes we send Steve all over the country and he teaches hundreds of people the joy of painting and from Steve and I would like to wish you happy painting god bless bye bye you
