hi Hey I'm certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic painting we're good let's start out and haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this project with me and they'll come across in the same orders I have them on the palette like always let's go on up here because I've got crazy today this is this is crazy day I found some tape laying around here in the studio and I just thought I'd show you with a little imagination and pick up a few things that are laying around you can do some fantastic things I've taken oh this is about 2 inch wide tape and went all the way around the borders here then they had some masking tape so I just I just put that in here like that then I've covered the entire thing with liquid white so it's all slick and ready to go so let's see what we can do I'm going to start off today with a touch of alizarin crimson just a touch tap it into the brush just a touch don't want to set this guy on fire we just want to warm it up let's go right up here now maybe right in here there's a little bit of alizarin crimson very very small amount once again you don't want to set it on fire for just just a little and use little crisscross strokes both sides of the brush and it mixes with a liquid white it makes a beautiful beautiful pinkish glow just like it just paint right over the tape don't worry about it don't worry about it now then without even cleaning the brush I'm going right into her hide into some midnight black and the least least little touch of phthalo blue very little paint on the brush but the black and the blue are so strong that you don't have to clean the pink off all right let's go back up here now I'll start right up here at the top and begin just blending this right down to the paint carrier I think today let's do a very soft gentle little painting just very quiet there we go can't touch more of the black and blue black and blue that's what I get when I get in trouble at home wise black and blue there we go and I stay in trouble all right blend it right there now be careful be careful here because this dark color will absolutely consume your pink and just a heartbeat they'll eat it all up shoot while I get that going listen let's have some fun this is mostly black there's virtually no blue in here so be careful and I'll just let's just put a little color down here what the heck all right now then we'll clean the brush scrub it on the there's a screen in the bottom this can just scrub it real hard the screens about a hole about an inch high that's the fun part anyway the screens about an inch high and that allows you to scrub the brush and then all the solid material falls to the bottom and keeps your paint thinner relatively clean okay now then clean dry brush and I want to just bring this guy together gently gently gently bring it together still using little crisscross strokes just here and there there so he's and EDIUS and it's very lightly very lightly go across the whole sky to soften it bring it together yeah maybe tell you what what the heck this is crazy doing we're just playing let's just take the the corner of the two-inch brush and go through a little touch of white a little touch and maybe there's just an indication up here very light I don't I don't want very distinct clouds today maybe there's just a little floater he lives up here and he just floats around the sky I've just used the corner of the brush then we'll blend that out just just to give the hint of a cloud yes the Hampton don't want anything too bright too sharp back here I want this guy to be very passive okay maybe well maybe there's even a little floater coming right down through here if it gets too bright just taken and just work with a little bit just work with it'll blend into the color it's already on the canvas and just go away here we go now then I'm just gonna fluff these little clouds up with a dry brush just fluff them up and very lightly very lightly just blend it a little bit a little bright right there I want these to be very soft clouds so we just blend it and go back over it and that easily it goes away that easy okay now then let's build us a happy little mountain for that I'm going to take a little bit of Prussian blue black a little brown shoot lift throw some crimson in there to lizard crimson pull it out very flat cut across do we have a little roll of paint there we are now then maybe there's a happy mountain he lives right about there so you just push that paint right into the fabric and all we're looking for here is just a very basic shape you're only interested in the top just right up here on the top you could cure less what's happening in here some no concern right now later on it will be right no concern yeah then show you a little trick here watch here we'll take this and pull it down now with that I get a little paint on the brush let's take that paint and go right up here and that easy we can make the indication of a little mountain that lives we we back in the distance he's very soft and very far away see by pulling this pain up here and doing it then it's exactly the same color just a different value there we go now pull this one distinctly in front of it in that sneaky I thought you'd like that okay by pulling it out we remove the excess paint and blend it right down to nothing don't worry about the tape just pretend it's not even here there tape will wash your brush give a good wrap and off we go in a couple of series back we we introduced this idea of using contact paper and making ovals and all kind of shapes since then I've got letters from all over the country showing me what people have done taking this basic idea using contact paper my friend NAT who lives in Canada he sent me some pictures the other day and he's taken and used octa Coons and all different kinds of shapes cut out of contact paper and it's the same basic idea try all different kind of things at home you'll be amazed at what you can do alright let's take some let's take some titanium white pulled out very flat really pull it out flat and then cut across like that little roll of paint will go right up here and we'll put some highlights on this mountain just touch it we're going to apply no pressure whatsoever you just let the knife literally float across the canvas just float here we go and put all kinds of little things in here there let's go right up here there okay and just decide where you think light would strike your mountain and just let it fall on there you want the paint to break now when I say break I mean leave all these holes in it and for that you must have a firm paint if you have a thin super oily paint oh you're gonna be an agony city you're gonna you're gonna be a mud mixer and then you're gonna holler at me so be sure you use a paint that's very far that's so important so important a little bit right there okay and you can just keep honing on making big decisions where you want this to be there okay now then let's make a shadow color gotta have a shadow in it Mountain for that we'll take some white so white a tiny bit of Prussian blue Russian Blue is very strong be careful be careful and then little black so we have black blue and white there and just leave it sort of marble like that don't over mix it cut across and we have our little roll of pain again always using that little roll of paintings go up here now then decide where you shadows are and once again using no pressure just drop in some happy little shadow see there just make decisions where these shadows live make a decision and do it this is your Mountain so you can do anything here that you want to do there we go now watch let's do this one right here show you a little trick here if you've painted even before you've seen this so now we want to push this peak right here back watch here watch here come right down right down right down and go distinctly through it and look at that see did you know you had that much power you can move mountains getting move mountains when I go home I can't move nothing but the garbage but here here I can move anything there we go okay now then we'll come back and listen oh look at that plug it there you just put all the little peaks and stuff maybe yes yes there is you're right there's one that lives right there you knew that didn't you there we go you can just keep on and on till you've covered your entire campus with mountains and that's fun - nothing wrong with that go back drop us in a happy little shadow here and there see there let it blend right out okay let's go right in here every every highlight needs a shadow if he didn't have a shadow he just will just lay there he won't come out and play with you all right all right now then let's create some mist down here at the base and for that I'll take a two-inch brush and I'm gonna tap just tap follow these angles if they come down this way and tap down that way there we go always follow those angles so it's very very important and if everything works just right you have a nice misty base that you can literally see detail in but yet see through it over here follow these angles see that easy you're fantastic now yeah I'll beat the brush a little bit that'll take the excess paint off then lift it upward just lift it up lift up look at that look at that I've probably painted 20,000 paintings and I still get excited when I see them a beautiful beautiful effects you can make so easy because for years I was traditional painter and I oh my gosh I agonized over paintings and now then now then I just do them okay painting should not be agonizing it should be fun you should enjoy what you do it okay let's come along here and let's have some fun I'm gonna tell you what let's just go right in to a little bit of yellow I reach up here get some get some SAP green and I'm gonna pull a little bit of black into that just to dull it down okay there we go tap the brush tap it let's go back up here maybe there's a little Foothill just a little hill lives right here all you have to do is just tap want this to be a nice bright one back in the distance tap now allow it to pick up that color we laid on the canvas see there and yet just disappear right down so it gets softer softer softer softer see there look at that softer softer almost down to nothing down here good okay listen let's take some black Prussian blue brown whoo there's some SAP green we'll throw it in there and throw in some crimson it doesn't matter it'll really what you're looking for is a color that's very dark let me wipe my knife off here and I'll grab the old fan brush and let's make a let's make a couple of happy trees load a lot of paint into the brush really fill it up okay let's go up Aaron let's decide where a little tree lives he lives right there touch I sort of gives you a guide at the top of the tree and then just just use the corner just the corner and as you work down push harder and harder so it pushes the bristles downward let's let's make several trees in here and in your world in your creation do you decide you want ten trees ten ten trees is what we're looking for there let's make several that'll give you a chance to practice now see right there I won't that little tiny bit of green to show through cuz I don't that'll show that there's something happened behind there okay now trees don't all rue the same summer skinny some are a little heavier shoot summer just there like me they're just hard so however don't think your tree has to be a certain way trees just grow however it makes them happy and sometimes when they're little maybe maybe a big old bear walks by and steps on them gives up a hurt whoo and they get little crooks and bends and just make up little stories think what happened at all these little trees seen I hear his one didn't maybe this one kicked him so he's leaning over just sort of pushed him right out of the way you get mean trees - okay should we put a couple more over here little trees are fun to make and maybe we back in here there's just a little indication of some trees just take maybe you can see that just take that the brushing tap it downward - lets make the indication some trees that are far far away that easy maybe there's one right here I'm just gonna cover the whole campus with trees here maybe I should stop I get carried away sometimes I like to make these little rascals there we can pop in some dark color now then I'm just gonna take a clean knife nothing on it and just sort of scratch through here and there it'll make it look like some little tree trunks you could put color on it but you don't have to there look at all the little things all kinds of little details that easy and without cleaning the brush because it has black and blue on a no go right into the yellow and that'll make a beautiful beautiful rich green let's go back up here and with that I just want to place the indication of a few highlights I want to keep these trees quite dark for the contrast but a few little highlights here and there there's some sparkly happy little things right up to here there we go and pretty these are the kind of scenes my mother likes she's a fantastic lady she lives in Florida and she's enjoying the sunshine now she'd have to be a fantastic lady to put up with me while you you got to be something to live with a crazy painter there we go her and I have to go fishing together but we're not very good fishermen we can we catch we catch a fish and we put a bandaid on he's put him back in the water and wishing we'll send him on his way okay back to the back to the old brush here and I'm just using a little bit of green and I'm gonna pick up this dark color and begin creating the general lay of the land just tap continually tapping kept hollering look at that just allow the brush to touch that dark that you made you trees out of and just begin creating all kinds of little effects and I'll add a little touch of yellow ocher little Andy and yellow hearing they're the least little bit of the brighter head you can make this look just like a happy little metal out here and the more you tap the softer kits it's very gentle and very soft they're just sort of work these colors back and forth tap them together like so wherever in your world you make the decision where where all these little things are and you put them in there we go and you can you can change the lay of the land watch watch right here shoot look at this look here by changing this angle you can make the land come this way there's no into it and just go on and on and on there see baby look at that and that neat you can do all of that I'm hearing they're dropping little darker colors okay maybe right out here maybe the sun's gonna hit this so you can go back and add little highlights where you want to really stand out or you wanted to really shine there we go tell you what hey do you know me shootout I want a little cabin out here that's such a pretty pretty area now there's several ways to make little cabins one of the easiest ways is to take your knife and scrape out a basic shape if you just take it it does two things it allows you to lay out your there little cabin without being committed but probably more important in that it removes excess paint so your next layer of paint will stick much better see there that quick you can just creep out of cabin shape now let's take some Van Dyck Brown and we'll put in an EVE or an overhang whatever then put some all we're doing right now it's just blocking in color just blocking in color doing not to worry yet about details look at there that easy let's put some dark right there this is just straight Van Dyke Brown this all it is straight Van Dyke Brown there we go Mandy maybe up here on the roof let's use some red a little bit of darks and I mix together a little bit more than bright red ooh here we go cut us off a little roll of paint as usual now then just take and just let this sort of bounce right along to just let it touch bounce have fun see it look at there okay now then I'm going to take white just add a little bit of black to it make gray white and black pull this off a little bit of paint and will go right up here soon pull it down see there straight down now for the other side I want it darker I was not as much lights gonna hit that site my Mountain tells me my light is coming from the right so I'm gonna get two small knife it gets in those little areas better and I'm going to reach right up in here see that's much darker in this little knife boy it's great for these little things like yes and I have a little knife let's put us a door right there shoot now we can chop this off like so we might even want a little window hmm anything you want in your cabin you can do it let's go right here put some grass right around the foots right around his little flecks there okay I'm gonna put just so these stands out the least little touch of white or light color right along this edge so you can oh nice nice little cabin let me grab the old fan brush let's take some straight Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna mixed in it got to have a happy little path maybe it comes down maybe it goes right on out of sight behind that hill comes out here wherever you want your path to go look at that look at that see there there we go reach right up here grab a little white and it'll mix with a brown that'll give us a little highlight just sort of let that skip across here just Boop hit it nice and quick because that it's killing thanks and clean it up with a little bit of a little bit of the grassy areas right along my cabin there and that pushes your path right into your painting let's get crazy tell you what let's go into a big bunch of brown dark sienna with a fan brush and right right right right right there right there lives a happy tree big happy tree that lives right there and let's give him an arm he's got an arm that lives there there we go okay pull that right down give him a little Flitz okay I'm going to paint thinner with a liner brush a lot of thinner what does to be just like ink or water and with that we'll put the indication of a happy little little branch here and there there okay there we go and just as many or as few of these little downs as you want in your world this one here maybe comes clean over here look at that Oh kinds of them and we can take I will go right into a little bit of white and let's just look at there I had the indication of a little highlight right on that just here and there so that little tree trunk stands out has a personality all with its own little sticker - down here I can't and let's just clean up his little foots fix our path I think we go I don't have a finished penny now then comes the fun let me show you bring the camera right up here close I'm going to grab this it's hitting that neat now if you when you're doing this at home if you painted this brown in here for example it looks just like you're looking out of a window it's a super idea give it a try use the contact paper tapes all kinds of different things you too can make some fantastic effects from all of us here happy painting god bless and we'll see you next time you
