oh hey I'm certainly glad you could join us today I thought today would just do a lovely little painting since this is the last show of the sixteenth series so tell you what let's start out having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let me explain what I've got going up here today I have a canvas just regular 18 by 24 inch I've put a contact paper oval on here I've cut an oval out of contact paper I've taken black gesso and just sort of painted a basic little shape like so around and let that dry completely then on top of that I've put transparent color and today I've made sort of a lavender color out of phthalo blue and alizarin crimson covered the dark area in the white that's just plain old liquid white so tell you what let's just do a fantastic little painting I will start out the day with the least little amount of phthalo blue just the tiniest little bit of phthalo blue on the old two-inch brush let's just put the indication up here just a beautiful little sky I just want a little bit of bluey back here not much and just let it fade more and more as it works down here we head on down to virtually nothing there very soft I want this to be a soft painting today okay and then we can wash that old brush and that's basically all that I'm looking for there we go now back to the brush that splashing is the most fun this is the brush that used to put the dark color on it still has some of the dark color in the bristles and with that I'm just going to begin tapping in some very basic shapes of some nice limbs that are hanging over here on trees and just using the corner of the brush just begin putting in all these basic shapes allowed to pick up a little bit the liquid white and work it back just back and forth forth and back there we are and maybe in here you can you can think up little individual tree shapes and bushes there we go and if you run out of paint just reach down here and work back and forth thing pick up a little bit more keep right on going maybe back here there's just the indication of a tree that lives we back here somewhere nice sized tree there all we're looking for is just a very very basic little shapes can't hardly even see them at this point as I say I would like to have this a very soft painting and we're done there we are okay and then take the old liner brush dip it into some paint thinner some paint then I go right into that same color that I put on the back that lavender color it's stay low blue alizarin crimson maybe I'll get just a touch more of the crimson there I want it a little bit more into the reddish hue there we are all right let's go up here now then maybe in here lives a nice little tree trunk now if you had trouble making this flow all you need to do is add a little bit of paint thinner to your brush just add a little paint there now you just put some indications here and there little sticks twigs all kinds of things that you'd see out in the woods this is where the little squirrel plays there may be in here there's a few little things you just make all kinds of little indications some of these will cover up some will leave and people think you work for long long periods of time to put all this much detail in your painting and we don't tell them any different that's our secret there we go I know years ago I had someone asked me said Bob how long does it take you to do a painting and that's a 20 minutes and 20 years it doesn't make much sense at first but I practiced for 20 years so I could do it in 20 minutes that's all now then back in here let's start Hammonds fine we'll take a little white little white little white be right back reach up here grab a touch of the alizarin crimson little touch of the blue I want sort of a pinkish lavender color whatever you want to call it a mauve color pretty color that's all we care about there now I'll tap the brush give it a little forward mmm when you do it that'll that'll load paint right out on the tips of the bristles all right now maybe in our world maybe back here in this little distant tree there's a least little indication here of some beautiful little leaves think about form and shape use just the corner of the brush just the corner of the brush now if you have trouble making this stick add the least little touch the ease little touch of paint thinner or even a little liquid white liquid white will change the color a little paint thinner will not just dilutes it there we are say there he lives just some soft happy little things out here but think about shape and form so so important so so important and we can sort of vary these colors I'll go into a little bit more than they'll Oh blue yeah a little more blue that's not quite enough a little more there we go that's a little better what this almost blend right into the sky so soft so very soft quiet happy little place just all kinds of little trees bushes bunny rabbits hide back in here same there's another one he lives right there but just the corner of the brush you can use a two inch brush one edge brush on occasion I even use a fan brush to do this just whatever but working layers that's what's so very important if you don't work in layers then it's going to look flat and we want to depth and distance in here little dark areas that you can look up in there and see between okay I want to get crazy now what the heck I want to add a little bit of SAP green some yellow a little yellow ochre put some Indian yellow in here in a minute maybe here and there there lives beautiful little weed let pretty a little green Bush right in here and we're just playing with color here and as I've mentioned before when you buy your first tube of paint you get an artist license so you could do anything that you want to do a lot of times people buy paintings more for color than for content so if you're ever out selling paintings that's a good good thing to remember okay a little bit more math a low blue a little bit more be alizarin crimson just darkening that color up same color I'm just making a little bit darker tap a little that into the brush a little there that's pretty okay now maybe right in here oh there's a nice little bush nice little bush work on individuals of one at a time if necessary give each one a name make friends with it whatever it takes but work at one at a time one at a time you get getting a hurry it starts feeling good and you take off and you won't knock out a whole bunch of it once and they just sort of blend together one at a time it's most most important that way you can put them in the layers see there's depth between these two and all those little sticks are hiding in those dark places that's what you're looking for that's what makes your painting special I have a couple of brushes here that I'm sort of going back and forth with one of them has the greenish colors and other one has pinkish colors so I don't contaminate the two that's a nice one just the corner of the brush all we need and and get a little darker color as we get back in here things are gonna get darker darker not as much light playing back here just little indications of a few things there that's where the whole nighttime creatures sleep they come up here in the daytime get out of the light got a little little condo back here and got two BMW parked in the garage okay a little bit on the other side already it looks like we have a whole forest there just layer after layer after layer there ma'am maybe maybe maybe maybe in our world back here maybe there's a little water back here you know me I'm crazy about water I think it's just so beautiful than painting so we'll just take a little titanium white on the two-inch brush now we got to start making some big decisions where does your water live maybe in our world let's say we're right about here make a decision touch pull straight down just pull it because there's color on the canvas that lavender color it'll mix with the white and automatically these beautiful little things will just happen they'll just happen you don't have to worry about a fight with them they're there because you put that transparent color underneath one of the questions that I hear repeatedly is how do I tell if a colors transparent put it on black canvas just take little on your finger rub it on the black canvas if a canvas still looks black then it's transparent enough for what we're doing some colors are only semi-transparent but they work for what we're doing now cross like so but if you put an opaque color on there like right red or white you'll immediately immediately you'll know what I'm talking about because the canvas won't look black anymore it'll stand out that's not what you're looking for if you want to transparent color let's take Van Dyke Brown a little roll of paint on the knife I have to start deciding how our lamb lives back here maybe oh there's another little projections see that happened just where the brush was at then you come back and put a little dirt on there and make all kind of things so maybe there's shooting there's all kind of little there it is just sort of look at your individual painting don't don't just try to copy what somebody's done we all try to teach you to copy here we want to show you how to do a technique and then turn you loose on the world I absolutely turn you loose because then you can do anything that you want to do all you have to do is learn the basic technique and I think thank this little show will give you all that you need as far as technique goes there pull it out like so cut across and once again our little roll of tape that's just dark seeing a little white come right across like so barely touching maybe I'll add a little more white I don't want to look brighter I want you to be able to see it a little better sometimes when we're doing TV we paint a little bit brighter and normal just so it shows up a little bit when you do your painting you make that big decision how do you want it to be darker lighter it's up to you up to you just barely grazing the canvas here that these things just sort of bounce along don't kill all the dark though don't kill all the dark starts feeling good and you just keep going and going and going next thing you know there's nothing left but high light and you need the dark in order for your light to show need that you really need them okay now let's go back to our little one-inch brush here maybe there's a happy little Bush it lives right there sort of projects down on the land just wherever you honor there all kinds of little things Oh can't I just sort of brings it together and kills that straight edge it was right up there sometimes you take a little dark put underneath there and it makes a whole new projection if you're making little stones and rocks and that's nice that's nice let's take a little bit of that lavender color on the knife same old lavender color here and there maybe just put the indication of a little little water line just to sort of touch it just nice colors it just came help but like in colors like this and as I mentioned earlier if you're out selling paintings colors like this sell people are looking for happy colors to put in their house take a little liquid white little titanium white mix them together reach up here little a little blue let's have some fun back here just take the fan brush and begin just putting in some little highlights on the water don't want to kill all your reflections because they'll show let them show through these highlights that you're putting on there there we go maybe the water is just coming along here and having a good time all of a sudden fell over look at that see maybe there's just a tiny little happy little waterfall lives right there it's not a very big one there's just a tiny little splash down here where it hits but not too much we don't want this scene to get too violent this is very peaceful calm little thing so there we are that's enough something like that alright there we go just sort of work that brush back and forth but see these areas like right in here leave those don't don't try to cover them all up they're very very pretty and you can see those reflections we put in there they're hiding in there all right now then maybe over here on this side let's just go back to our 2 inch brush this is the same color that I used and let's put a company's a happy little group of bushes that live right along here wherever like any shape that you want here just make some little individual things maybe it comes right on back up in here that sort of brings it all together just brings it together you have to decide how big your bushes here there he is ok now we get her there's our two brushes I have two brushes that I'm using to put these highlights on when you're painting at home too you'll also find that two brushes the 1 inch and the 2 inch will save you a lot of a lot of time and a lot of brush cleaning have one brush for lights one for darks toupees tremendous dividends and if you're lazy like I am you really understand they're ok individuals again though one at a time well there's a nice one it it looks like it's sort of just hanging over like a big big fern there something that's one of those happy accidents we talk about all the time they just sort of happen and when they happen learn to live with them sometimes when a happy accident happens you jump in there and tear it up before you think look at it before you do I'm just using the cad yellow yellow ochre little SAP green Indian yellow touch a bright red here and there just want to put the indication of it another little bush right there like so maybe he's got a friend that's right they're still working in layers I know you get tired of hearing me say that but it's so important so very important okay might be right out here right over the water and it pretty there he is mmm okay go to my other brush maybe right in here somewhere well there's a nice lavender one just sort of back and forth however you want there maybe maybe in our world but a little brown right here maybe there's a happy little stone here we don't know what side where you want it drop it in take a little highlight color let it touch bounce barely touching that sort of a bounce rate longer brighten it up a little bit more oh there there it not pretty and you can do it no you can do it no you can do it every day I see evidence that people can do this literally thousands of people have picked up brushes and tried that's all it takes you can do anything that you believe you can do and if I know you can do it you certainly believe you can do it because I wouldn't lie to you there there here we go that's always sad for me to come to the last show of a series but we're already under production for the next series in this it's over 200 shows now if you haven't got to see all of them in your area give you station a call tell them you'd like to see them that's the only way they know and shoot if they want to see and we'll get them to it okay - maybe up in here let's have some nice trees take some we'll take some paint thinner Van Dyck Brown we'll be right back and reach down here and get a little white though ooh that's nice maybe a little dark sienna in there - let me get a little more thinner be right back oh there's what we're looking for look how thin that is see it run that's the secret that's the secret okay maybe we want some nice tree trunks up in here touch and as you work down here let the brush turn wiggle jiggle that it have fun let it have fun there there we go maybe he's got a friend right there okay now when you're doing this if you have trouble making it stick add a little paint thinner to it just means it's doesn't flow just means it's not quite thin enough to flow right over there and the paint we use I say it over and over only in case somebody has just tuned in it's very thick it's very dry very firm except the high light colors now the yellows are manufactured to a thinner consistency but these base colors especially the dark colors have to be extremely firm dry and thick other way you if you have too thin little skinny paint so you try to paint on one over top of the other you're going to be a mud mixer and you're going to talk bad about me and I want it to work for you a good test take your paint take a top off of it give it a squeeze page stand about 3/4 of an inch or so above the tube by itself it'll do that and it's probably probably firm enough for what we're doing try a little bit on the other side here maybe there's an old tree lives over here too we got this nice dark area there we are split it in put it in there little touch make that trunk a little little bigger now yeah it's time to come up here and begin putting some highlights on these old big trees we'll just use our use some of this green color what the heck maybe when you do yours you want those to be lavender or pink or blue whatever tap a little color push that brush so you get that color right out on the tip now I have to make big decisions here where does your leaves live up here using just the corner of the brush just the corner and once again worry about patterns and shapes don't just throw it on there we go I know sometimes when you watch the shows here it looks like we just run up here and sock it on and it just falls off any over take your time that we have to do that because we're we have time restraints you don't enjoy enjoy the whole object of painting just to make you happy we hope that it also brings an awareness of nature and all of god's little creatures that you begin to see things let you look around and you see color you see form you see shape you see all the beauty that's around you all the time so often so often we look all of our lives but we don't see anything and painting will teach you to see I've had people write and said there's been a tree living in my front yard for the 20 years and I never saw it I never saw it until I listened to you and understood color and form and shape and I looked out there and the tree said good morning to me today and it's been there all this time and if we can awaken an awareness in you of God's creations then we've done a good job here there let's go on the other side maybe right there see its touch let it go wherever you want wherever beautiful beautiful this is such a nice little painting and if you've never painted before this is one you might want to try because it's easy enough that you can do it on the first shot and it works and you'll amaze your family and your friends and they won't believe you done it they'll think you went out and bought it so thins when you paint for them said you can dress up and show them how to do it and when you find something good spread it around to show others how to do it Jude that's that's where half the fun of painting is is sharing it with other people just sharing it there I'm gonna take a little bit of a very light lavender color some paint thinner let's go up here maybe here and there we can back in here we can see a little light stick of a twig just wherever you want there we go there's just little things living back in here all the little doers that live back in the woods okay take a clean knife scraping stick it to here all we're doing is legs and that black to show through makes it look like hundreds of little sticks people think you've worked yourself half to death and we won't tell them that's our secret yours in mine spring the camera up here take this oval off I think we have a pretty painting so let's see look at that this is it isn't it fantastic this is one of the nicest most interesting little scenes to do won't take a little too bright red little paint thinner I think will sign this one call it finished I really hope you've enjoyed it these little paintings will make you happy they're quite easy to do they bring up a lot of richness to your life and as I mentioned earlier this is our last show of the sixteenth series I've enjoyed being with you you're very very special to me and I want to wish you the very best that life has to offer I'll see you in the next series and until then happy painting god bless take care of yourself my friend production of
