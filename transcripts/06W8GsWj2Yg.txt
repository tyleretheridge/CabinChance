hi welcome back I'm certainly glad you joined me today today let's do one of the most popular things that we've ever came up with in this series and that is the little oval painting now this little oval it's just cut out a contact paper that you can buy at your local supermarket or hardware store whatever just normal contact paper I've cut an oval out stuck it on the canvas and then I've covered the canvas that's exposed here with a thin even coat of the liquid white so it's all wet and it's ready to go so let's start out and haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started today let's have a let's have a happy little painting just beautiful little sky and we get a little crazy with color I'm gonna start with a little touch of a little touch of phthalo blue on the two-inch brush plus we to hang your little phthalo green add to it what the heck use very little a phthalo green though it's so so strong so strong eat up your whole world in a heartbeat okay let's go ahead up here let's just have a little sky at it just dances around and has fun like so just just just dance it I like it use a little Chrissy cross strokes let them go once again very very small amount of this green you don't want to get too crazy of the green there I only have that color on the brush i play-doh blue a little green maybe we'll have a touch of water right somewhere down here I don't know exactly where it's comfy where we feel like putting it but right now we can go ahead and add some color in here and it'll be their way to notice when we get down there before I clean the brush we'll go into a small amount of Prussian blue just tap the brush into a little and I'm worried to be right back be right back get a little tiny amount of crimson person to do a little bit of crimson then I'm gonna go right down in here and just put in a little darker color enough under the base of this little touch of crimson impression blue there I don't want to over blend this because it's so strong it'll eat up his life blue like so there okay let me wash the old brush just scrape it off shake off excess and cover the camera me they hate me all the cameramen around here have freckles you can tell which ones work on this show camera ladies to get in trouble here there now all I'm doing is just blending this together Jana's putting it together see already that makes some dynamite sky beautiful little sky okay now there let me find a one-inch brush I'm gonna go right into titanium white just load the brush full of titanium Oy quite a bit of paint on the brush just tap the brush right into the color okay let's go right up here in this bill it's a happy little cloud and we'll do that but just taking the corner of the brush and just tapping just tapping see that's all I have to do just tap in little clout what can be easier and more fun you sort of have to make some decisions here where did you where does your little clouds live maybe there's one there he is you knew there is one there it just sort of decide where you want it then putty man cause on this piece of canvas you can do anything that you want to do absolutely anything look at that and all we're doing once again it's just tapping just tap tap there there we go okay now then backed ever this is just a big old two inch brush and very lightly just using little Chrissy cross strokes crisscross strokes I'm just gonna blend this and then follow the angles see they're just blend it a little hollow angles don't overwork these clouds don't overwork them they'll go away and leave you Splenda mal ittle tiny bit and just do like it's all there is to it it's so easy to overwork them and then they're not happy anymore somebody sent me a letter here a while back and said that I use the word happy too much that everything is happy in my world and that's true in my world which is right up here everything is happy okay I'm going to take a little bit of phthalo blue least little touch of crimson and a little tiny tiny amount of phthalo green and then little white so we can find out what color we have this makes a little bigger pop we're going to use it several times blue little touch of crimson not much little play-doh green a little white so we can tell what color we have oh that's nice that's nice okay now one makes several different values of this or several different degrees of lightness so I'll add just all see I have a light little darker in real dark all in the same pile I have it tell you what today let's use the old oval brush and I'm gonna go into that lightest color lightest color and just add a little color to the brush just juicer back and forth okay and then maybe there's some little hills Lily back here and I want these to be so light they almost fade right into the sky because they're far away very very light there goes our pretty little cloud we mean it's okay as long as you learn how to make one many times not wasted this one's very light it's almost the color of the sky and very soft okay with our big brush left tap the base of this just using the top of the big brush and we're only tapping the base just just to create the illusion of mist very lightly lift upward see how that almost just fades right into nothing fantastic now that let's go into our next darker color it's the same color only with less white blowed the brush the same way maybe there's another little hill and he lives right here see this oval brush gives you that nice rounded effect and you can turn the brush side words and make different different little effects if you want it's up to you see makes nice little things up pull this straight down straight on down hmm back to my large brush same thing again let's have the base up and lift slightly upward you need that little bit of mist that's the only thing you have this separates all these so that misty area is most most important it's your friend take care of it treat it good treat it good Kate and then back to our same color this is the darkest color we had all right now maybe you have to make a decision maybe right in here there's another little foothill but look at all the different planes see one two three all those different planes create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting that's what makes your painting stand out from other paintings makes your painting special devote a lot of time to looking paintings and the ones that you like usually they have a lot of different planes in there we go now once again back to our big brush and we tap just the base then it's to create that illusion of mist that fantastic I know you could do it there and already we have a one super little painting and then tell you one let's have another plane maybe it comes down this way and for that get a little darker I'll use that same blue but I'll also put in some black I'll go right into some midnight black so we have the same color we is using for the background with black candy this is getting closer so it should be darker and value maybe let's just take the big brush and let's just tap in a general shape here maybe it comes white does now right down there it is like so all we're doing here is just tapping downward which is tamping down and begin thinking about the lay of the land maybe this is a nice Hill that rolls over here say there just like so and maybe back here on this hill maybe there's some happy little trees that live back here so you can just take the corner the big brush and all we're looking for right now is just some very basic little shapes very very basic little shapes there all we're doing is putting up some little some little arms up in the air okay and if we want to should we just go ahead here add a little more color and we can just fill in this whole area just by tapping we'll put something down here we'll worry about it when we get there there I know you're saying Bob you've done it this time where you really messed up a nice background you may be right open up that let's have some fun let me grab the old fan brush I like to play with fan brushes I'll show you something you can do here let's take really use some CAD yellow we'll be right back at me right back get some SAP green little touch it yellow ocher little Indian yell just mix them all on the brush okay let's go ahead up here yeah just all I'm going to use here is just the corner of the brush and just sort of wiggle it just pushing upward and sort of wiggling and a little touch of bright red here and there will make us a nice fall picture so you got all the orange and the reds and all those beautiful little colors just pushing upward with a corner of the brush I do you make the indication of just just hundreds and hundreds of little distant trees and bushes that live back here and Jack frosters been by hearing touch Donovan pear say they're all kinds of happy little things wherever you want now you're gonna get a certain amount of a certain amount of green of course because you're touching yellow to blue don't worry about it makes it pretty there see that easy you can make all kinds of little indications without really working a great deal this is a lazy man's way of painting I think painting should be fun and it should be easy and then if you want to if you want to pursue art you can get into those hard forms but this is a good way to start out and just enjoy okay I'm going to take the big brush shoot a little fan brush it's too slow let's go right back here into our yellows and SAP greens be right back get a little more green here kidnappin let's begin working on the general lay of the land we said this was going to sort of go in this direction so all I'm going to do is begin following a lay of the land however you want the land to flow and in my mind this is a hill here a little hill it just flows right down side here just like so and you can add all the little fall colors in there that you want okay as one of the simplest and nicest most effective ways of making little grassy areas that I've ever found there now that maybe tell you what tell you what in this style of painting you're always seeing things you want to change things tell you what maybe maybe maybe let's take some black so Browns and little SAP green into it little is room crimson okay let me clean my knife off now let's take our fan brush and load it full of paint both sides just pull it right through the color and maybe here and there there lives and your world just a happy little evergreen tree out here on this hill in your world maybe there isn't an evergreen if not don't put it in don't worry about it I just want to show you how and you make the big decision there's one it lives down here on the hill let's give them a couple friends over here and you just put as many or as few as you want there this is good practice though in the making these little rascals let's go back maybe it right there just however many we have them sitting right out there on the hill and we can take our big brush and just put a little bit of grass right down to little foots there and see that brings him right into the painting right into they become part of the painting don't him left out everybody wants to be part of the show put two more Rascals in their net up shine you could even take and pick up a little bit of this dark color and pull it out and it makes a nice shadow automatically look at that in that super I know you could do it yeah let me find it take a one inch brush I'll be right it to some of this dark color same same color that we use to make those little evergreen trees I'll add some Brown to it Van Dyck Brown what the heck dark Sienna - there kiss cup here maybe there's some little trees that live thing there's a whole liner let's put a whole line a little trees at there right here patients come right on down like so see oh we're worried about the tops we don't care about their bottom jib there we go oh we're looking for some nice color underneath okay let's go back to that fan brush we had so much fun making all those little things with a fan brush let's do a couple more we'll use some red some Indian yellow maybe these are some little trees that when the when the frost hits them they really get bright so let's just use a corner the brush push upward and begin working on some basically these are still far away but we want some basic shapes don't don't spend a lot of time worrying about individual shapes here but begin to think about individuals let them shine out here in the Sun some yellow ochre cadmium yellow all these bright spark a little colors just a whole line of happy little trees and all I'm doing is using just the corner of the fan brush pushing upward so that it the paint comes off in the upward stroke and practice us a little bit you'll find you can do fantastic things just by using a little fan brush there we go or you could do this with a one inch pressure 2 inch brush there go wherever you think he's little things should live that's where they would be okay and then we can just straighten that all up so see that creates another plane in your paint just plane after plane after plane and I'll go right in to same old dirty brush any bother to clean it right into the CAD yellow and the yellow ocher like so and because there was blue on that breakfast will turn a nice greenish color let's go back up here maybe there's a little grassy area that lives right here all you have to do is just tap the tap it layer starting a father's two way and working forward forward forward like so like so there they are see there how easy that is take the knife and back in here maybe just cut testing the casebook some little tree trunks just a few hair in there sort of give some detail to all of that will take a little bit of Van Dyck Brown little dark Santa mixed with it and now we have to make some big decisions here where's the bank maybe it comes right along in here wherever you want it wherever it goes on up here we don't know where it goes okay have it let's put a couple of nice big trees here I'll use the same old dark color with some brown in it maybe their lives right here right here just a happy tree this is a pretty good-sized tree and I'm just using a one-inch brush oh right over my beautiful little foothills will will stop at readers didn't kill all of them like so find another one-inch brush tell you what tell you what take a little brown a little white maybe use a small knife this will put the indication of it a little tree trunk right now brown then we just add a little white to it to highlight it so I'm show up have it and we'll go right into using a one-inch brush CAD yellow yellow ocher all my yellows and a little touch of the Reds and stuff tapping ass brush tapping it and sort of sliding it at the same time there okay yeah then let's put some nice highlights on this little tree and all I'm doing is using just the corner of the brush and just barely tapping now form and shape our most most important don't just throw this on at random think about the individual little limbs that live in this tree form and shape in shape no matter how you put it on a tree it's most important that you think how that trees made they're what makes it look like a tree what makes it an individual that's what you're looking to do yeah we can bring a little bit of grass down here just like so just tapping can we grab another fan brush I'm gonna dip it into a touch of the liquid white go right into titanium white and I put the liquid white in there only to thin the paint then paint will stick to a thick paint and then back in here I'm gonna put a little touch a little touch of water movement just a little water maybe there's a little Oh a little tiny waterfall right there and it hits and splashes just a little this is just a calm little waterfall not too much to it there we go and with that we can clean up all these little bottom edges bring it all together there see there's little stones and rocks underneath there just barely can see and they create little disturbances in the water you can make them that easy okay let's have some fun now tell you what let's bring the camera up here so we can see the whole thing and I'm gonna pull this oval off now watch what happens look at that didn't that fantastic now that I like to break the borders with these ovals they are so super the way they are but I get crazy sometime and like to do wild things I'll tell you what let me find a big two-inch brush here let's put a big tree that lives outside deal well we'll use that same old dark color we had some Van Dyck Brown now then let's say our tree all right real is right about here there it's a big tree strong big old tree all right look at this sign I gotta go I cannot careful this big tree you made up your whole world with it but I wanting to go outside of the borders in your world if you want this tree to stay inside the oval that's perfectly all right anything that you want to do that makes you happy is right all I'm doing is putting in some dark so our light will show maybe that comes right on down here we don't know let's set it come right on around there okay now we can take a fan brush and put some brown on one side and white on the other whoops in there we are see go I got white on one side dark on the other let's go ahead up here and just roll it right through the tree we can put us on a tree trunk right in there that easy and however many you want just drop a pin and back to our one inch brush that had the color on it and we just tapped in see all we're doing here is just tapping just tapping like so okay let's go right up here and again laying in some highlights on this tree just using the corner of the brush and worry about shape and form shape and form are extremely important I know you get tired of hearing me say that but I want your tree to look the way you want it to look so really practice that devote a lot of practice time to creating shape in your tree I know sometimes it looks like I just hit it a random but I really don't think like a tree go out the quad in front yard spend some time with a tree makes friends with you talk to him that's alright neighbors will thank you crazy who cares painters and painters are expected to be a little different so enjoy life and enjoy nature it's so fantastic sometimes we we spend half our life overlooking some of the most beautiful things because you see them every day you have a tendency to overlook them I'm adding a little SAP green to this color just to change its flavor maybe this is a different bush down here just give him a whole cans of little arms and but that easy you could create some of the most fantastic little things and little bita something comes right down in here hey you want us to let's take a little a little brown little white mixed together maybe there's a little touch of land you can see right in here see let that run right on out of the painting you gotta really make your painting so much more interesting like that and you can clean that up a little bit of grass right around just to bring it all together that I think you got one fantastic painting I hope you've enjoyed this one from all of us here happy painting and God bless you
