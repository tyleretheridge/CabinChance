- Hello again. You ready to paint
another fantastic picture? Well let's do it. I'm gonna have 'em run all
the colors across the screen so in case you've missed
'em in any of the shows you can pick up all the
colors that we're using. And while they're doing
that, let's get started. I'm gonna start today with a
little bit of Alizarin crimson. And we'll just put a little
bit on the large brush. Maybe today we'll just have some fun. Let's just go right into the
center of the canvas here with the crimson. Just making a little
criss cross strokes and let it blend upward. There we go. And down here we just go back and forth. Like that. Okay. Now we'll take and dip
into a little thalo blue. And go right to the very top. Go all the way across the canvas. And just let this work
right down into the pink. Okay. Now. I'm gonna go back into the thalo blue and add just a tiny bit of thalo green. Just let 'em mix together on the brush. And we'll come from the outside in and don't kill all your pink area in here. Like so. There we go. Okay now, let's clean the brush. And bring all this together. Alright with a nice clean
brush here I just wanna bring the pink and the blue together. Okay. So you can't tell where one
stops and the other one starts. And then we'll just blend
out all the brush strokes. Alright. Now then, let's take a palette knife, we'll take a little bit of crimson, and a little but of the blue. We'll take crimson and a
little bit of thalo blue. Just mix 'em together here,
more crimson than blue. We'll mix sort of a
purplish color, lavender. And let's make some little
streaky clouds in here. We're pushing very hard into the canvas. There. Just really push this paint
right into the fabric. Okay, and we're looking
just for basic general little shapes here. Mm. Maybe a couple of little
ones over in here. Don't want this side to get jealous. Something like so. Now. With a clean dry brush, very
lightly, just brush across. Very lightly. There we go. Super way to make little clouds. Maybe we wanna highlight
these cloud a little bit. So let's take a little bit of yellow. And a touch of the permanent
red and mix it together, we'll make sort of an
orangey looking color here, just to highlight with. And a very small amount of
paint and we go right above the dark and just lay a
little of that on there. Just here and there, don't
cover up all your dark. Just a little, here and there. Let it bounce around and play and just where you think light would hit. There. Okay. And maybe a little right here and there and when you're at home you can really take your time and do
a lot of detail here. And with a dry brush just
very gently blend this out. There we go. Very, very little pressure on the brush. Almost let a hair touch the canvas. Now. Let's take a little more crimson and let's use some Prussian blue, it's a little stronger. Crimson and Prussian blue. And let's go right up in here and make a happy little mountain. Just a simple little mountain. There we are, just to get
your base shape on there. General outline of the mountain. Take off all the excess
paint then with a large brush I'm just gonna pull it down
so it just blends right down into nothing. Okay, now while I have
that color on my palette, I'm gonna go ahead and reflect
this mountain into the water, we're getting a lot of
requests wanting to reflect mountains into the water. So just work on your basic
shape in painting backwards. Just a basic shape. Like so. And with a large brush we'll pull this in the opposite direction. So already we have a basic
reflection into the water. There we are. Now we'll take a little bit of white and put the smallest, smallest amount of permanent red into it. Just enough to give it
a little pinkish glow, we don't wanna set this mountain on fire. Just a nice pinkish glow. And we'll highlight this. Just follow the contour of the mountain. There we are. Maybe a little touch over in here. Now for the shadow, I'll use
a little bit of thalo blue. And white. Maybe I'll put just a tiny
bit of that purple in there, just to calm that blue down a
little bit, it's very bright. There, beautiful. Now let's put some happy
little shadows in here. Let the paint break, follow
right along the mountain. Have a little shadow in there,
divide those two up a little. Little bit in here. Little touch, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo. Now we'll take a clean, dry brush and very gently tap the bottom just to create some mist. Just like so, little bit
over in this direction. Let's sharpen this one up a little, it bothers me right here. Want him to be a little more distinct. There we go, that's better. Give him a little more character. Now. Down here on the bottom we'll
just lay some indications of highlights here and there. Just some indications. Now this paint I'm pushing
very hard into the canvas cause I don't want it to move. Okay. Now, tap that a little bit
just to take off excess paint. Now when you're doing
reflections like this, normally we pull straight
down to create a reflection. This time I'm gonna go up. Watch what happens, pull
it up, clean your brush. Just wipe off the excess paint. Cause you don't wanna
destroy these nice edges. In between each stroke
I'm wiping the excess paint off the brush. Okay, now from here we can
pull down that's no problem. And then gently we go across,
don't wanna lose this image. Okay and that quick we have
a reflection of a mountain. Okay let's put some happy little trees and stuff back in here and I'm gonna use some Van Dyke brown, Alizarin
crimson mixed together. Brown and crimson. And we'll go right along in here just wherever you think there
might be a little tree or a little bush, just drop
him in, this is your world. Let it happen. There. Now with a large brush
gonna grab just the bottom pull a little bit of that down so it also creates a reflection. There we go. Now, we use a one-inch
brush with a little bit of magic white on, just
to thin the paint and we'll go into some cad yellow. And a little bit of permanent red here. Make a nice bright color. And then we can begin highlighting these. Look at that son of a gun, mm. After all these years
it still fascinates me. And we can drop a little bit
of that color down in here just to create some reflections. There we go. And add a tiny, tiny,
touch of sap green to it. Just to dull it down a little bit. There we go. That is nice. And it works so well. Okay, now with a clean dry bush, just barely touch, just barely touch. Whisper light, you almost
touch the canvas with a hair. And then go gently across. And let's take, let's take, some brown, sap green, and a little bit of blue. Brown, sap green, and
blue, in about equal parts. And let's put some little
evergreens back in the background. Always like little
evergreens, they're pretty. They remind me of home in Alaska. There we are, just some little ones. We'll give him a little friend here. There. Maybe just one a little bigger right here. And these are your trees so they can be as big or as small as you want. Okay, that gives us a few little trees. Now with a palette knife and
a little bit of magic white I'm gonna put a touch of brown into it. Just to dull it down a little. We'll put a happy little
water line back here. There, just like you're
trying to cut a hole right through the canvas. Maybe there's a little
ripple or two on the water. Just here and there. Okay. Now, let's do something
a little bit different than we've done in the past. We're gonna put a little bit
of paint thinner into the brush and I'm gonna pull it first
through Van Dyke brown, there's a tiny bit of thinner
on the brush, just enough to thin the paint a tiny, tiny bit. We'll go through brown on one side, then I'm gonna turn the
brush over and over here I'm gonna go through white. So I've got brown on
one side of the brush, white on the other. Brown and white. Alright, now let's put some
little trees right here. Touch the canvas and pull. And we get both sides of the tree at once. Brown with white. Maybe he's got another
tree that lives right here. Kay, brown. And white. Put a third one right in here. We'll let this one sort of lean
over he's a tired old tree. Kay that was so much
fun, let's double load another brush here, little
bit of the paint thinner, just to thin it. And I'll go into sap green. Just load the bristles full of sap green. And on the other side
we'll go through yellow. So we have sap green on one
side, yellow on the other. All we're gonna do now is
just begin tapping the canvas. And we get highlight and
shadow all in one stroke. Okay, sap green and then
back through the yellow. There we go, ooh almost messed
up and put the dark on top. And you'da caught me. Kay, sap green. And yellow. And we'll put some little
leaves on this one. And that's just a super simple
little way to make trees that's very, very effective and very nice. Now let's go back to the
crimson, and the brown mixed together and we'll put some
little bushes down here on their foots. There we go. Okay, and let's just reflect
that right into the water. With a large brush now we
can take and pull these reflections down, straight down. Now maybe you wanna reflect some of these trees into the water. So I'll load the brush the
same way, brown on one side, white on the other. And then just do your basic shapes here. Just like so. Brown and white. Just enough to give some indications. Then I'll go back to the brush that has the sap green and yellow on it. And just take in, tap in a few
little things here and there. Just wanna give some indications
down here in the water. Kay. Like so, we'll just use the other corner and do this very rapidly. Just so you have an idea. Then very gently, very gently,
just enough to whisper. Maybe we'll move some of these trunks so it really looks like water. Kay. Now I'm gonna add a little
tiny bit more magic white and go back into the yellow. And a little bit of the permanent red. And let's highlight these
little bushes right here. And reflect those colors
right into the water. Kay, now, into some ocre. Once again a little
more of the magic white. Into a little bit of ocre. Then we'll reflect that
right into the water. With our clean dry brush and we'll touch and just gently pull down. And go across. Okay. Now. Let's take a little bit of brown. And put us a shoreline in there. There we go, just straight
Van Dyke brown to start with. What a happy little lake
in here, need some ground for all these things to sit on. And we'll use some white and brown. Little touch of blue in it
to make some highlights. Barely touch, barely touch. Like so, a little magic white. To make us a waterline underneath. There we go. Betcha never thought you could
paint pictures like this, and you can. The little things that run
down here onto the base. Okay now we can come
over to the other side. Let's choose one of these
almighty brushes here and we'll take a little
bit of the Van Dyke brown, a little burnt umber,
just mix it on the brush. And let's just fire in some
pretty things right in here. Great big bushes and stuff
that live right along here. Just let 'em go. You know those trees that
we made by double loading the brush were so much
fun, let's do another one. Go into the brown. On one side of the brush,
white on the other. Okay, how 'bout if we
have one right there. There he goes (whistles softly). Brown. I was only gonna do one wasn't I? Got carried away, let's
put another one right here. Like so, we'll let him be
behind those bushes back there. Now let's put a little bit
of highlight on these bushes. Just a touch. There we go, let it get darker and darker and darker as it comes forward. Clean this brush up. A little more magic white. And we'll take a little
yellow, a little permanent red. And let's put a little
sparkler right out here. Oh there we are. Okay. Let's take a little bit of the brown. And begin building us a
little bank out in here. Something like so. And with a large brush, gonna
grab a little bit of this, and pull downward. Just to make some more reflections. Like that. Okay, now. Let's take the brush we
had loaded with sap green on one side and yellow on
the other and do that again. And we'll put a few little
highlights on these trees. And just touch. Just touch. Look at that, ain't that a fantastic way to make a lot of leaves? Sap green, and yellow. That's all we're using. There we go, now. If we wanted to put a
little more detail in here we can take a thin oil
mix it with some brown, and maybe just show a few
little limbs here and there, just some indications, maybe
there's an old dead one that hangs out through here. Like so. Kay. Maybe here and there, just indications. Okay, now, let's take and lay a little bit of highlight on these stones here. Just a tiny bit. Then we'll use the fan
brush for the little bit of green and yellow and all
the colors that we're using here mixed up and just sort
of bring all this together. Like that. Let's crease that right there. There, soften that, make it real soft. Now I'm gonna take just a
tiny bit of magic white. And mix it with firm white,
just to thin the firm white down a little bit. And let's come right along in here. And swirl that around (whistles softly). Like so. And with some more brown. Whoops, got a hair hanging there. Pull that right on down like this. And lay a little bit of highlight on it. And back to our fan brush with
a little yellow and green, the reds mixed together on it. And just bring that all together. And we can just take a clean knife and lay a few little sticks here and there. You need these little
sticks to show distance in the painting. Okay, let's go back over here and let me put a few sticks in. Wanna show distance here too. And this is a fun little
painting, it's a little bit different then a lot of
the things that we've done in the past. But experiment, practice. It's unbelievable what
you can do if you'll just take the time to practice
a little bit, enjoy it. Just have a super good time. I'm gonna push this tree
just a tiny bit further back, I'm gonna put a bush
right here in the front. Push him on back a little bit. Mm. We just got all kinds
of nice little things happening in here. Few little sticks. Alright. I wanna sign this, and then
talk just a few minutes. About the painting we're
gonna do next week. So let me get a little thin oil here. A little bit of the permanent red. And we'll put a signature
right on this one. Just like so. Kay, there we are. Now. Next week. Next week, we're gonna
do a fantastic painting like you've never seen before I think. What I want you to do if you're
gonna paint along with us is take a canvas, we're
gonna paint vertical, that's up and down. Go about 11 inches up and paint
the whole bottom of it black and leave the white, the top white, and you won't believe what we'll do. Until next week, happy painting. (calm, low-key music)
