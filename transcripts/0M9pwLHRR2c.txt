I certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic painting let's do it together then I'm gonna have them graphically run all the colors across your screens you need to do the painting I'm gonna do today and they'll come across and exactly the same order I had a moment palette starting with the white working around I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white it's nice and wet all right we got our oil paints here we're all ready so let's take off let's go right into a little bit of Prussian blue fresh you look very strong good dark blue tap that brush in there you must build a happy little sky and I thought today thought today we do some fantastic mountains I get a lot of letters wanting beautiful mountains if that have snow on them and also that you can see parts that don't have snow so we will play a little bit with that and notice I'm leaving some holes in the sky here we don't want it completely covered you didn't just want to leave some little holes up here in the sky let the light play through okay make it a little bit right in there just like so and we don't care where this goes today I'm going to vote most of the show to showing you how to do these mountains and it will just throw in a quick little foreground and go from there that is if everything goes right and sometimes sometimes I get slow or fast and I have to do things I didn't plan to do there we are and that easy we have a very simple nice quick little sky okay yeah you know that I'll take the knife it will go right into some midnight black right into some black and some of the Prussian blue black and blue I can't pull it out cut off a little piece just looking for a little roll of paint there it is see okay let's go up here now then we have to make some decisions where are these big old mountains gonna live in this pane maybe right there I'm really gonna put some big mountains in this one comes down maybe you have to make decisions here this is your world your creations you have to decide for all these little mountains and big mountains to the oven right there see there don't make all the Peaks too sharp also if you're not careful mountains will very soon look like look like wigwam village or ice cream cones so break up your shapes and I was grating off all the excess paint maybe you can hear how hard I'm scraping the canvas I'm really busy went into that canvas and scraping very hard push that color right into the fabric there and that gives us a quick basic little outline and at this point the only thing that you're really worried about is the top of these mountains you could care less what's happening in here now we'll take our 2 inch brush grab that and begin pulling it and this is a nice way to begin laying out the highlights and the shadows and all the beautiful little things that are going to happen in this sea just by using brush strokes you can begin laying out all of the things and you're not committed maybe and you can still you can even change some of the basic shapes look there look at that maybe that'll come right down through there and I have something there wherever where we're like just make a decision throw it in and go it's just blue and black and just put it in black and we just let it fade right into the liquid white here and it just looks like it's sort of hanging in the mist and that's exactly what we're trying to achieve we want it very soft at the base if you can see the entire mountain is always more distinct at the top than it is at the bottom because of mist pollution all those terrible things okay now let's start putting some some snow on it pull the paint out as flat as you can get it cut across get that a little roll of painting again okay let's clip here then you have to start making big decisions big decisions Gray's the canvas no pressure absolutely no pressure your light is coming from the right after left handed you might find it easier to have the light coming from the other side left-handed people have been forced to do right-handed things their entire life so it's sort of varies okay maybe there's a little light just plays right through here look at that see they're droppin they don't know where that goes yet don't tear here we go I have some light coming right down through there just think we're the creepy little sunlight would strike right here I'm gonna have a little more this is the way you create little peaks and valleys of all kinds of interesting things happening in there just sort of let your imagination go just let it go you want that paint to break my break I mean it has all these little holes here in it and we can Jaggi up the little edges there goes away I'm crazy words I use Jaggi I don't know if that's a real word or not but you understand what I'm saying don't want it to straight okay now then let's take let's take here mix up a little blue and white a little bit of pression blue white and with that will create shadows pull it out flat go across that same little roll of paint there you are let's go up here and do it now then begin to going in here and picking out where the shadows are and don't kill all those beautiful dark colors that we work so hard to lay on there maybe that comes down and maybe it drops right on down like that see let's that show through there comes another one wherever wherever anywhere you want a little peek just lay it in saying it is a little shadow it comes right down here and just sort of just sort of blends together here comes another one see how you can bring all these right together that all these happy little things just happen there's another little peak works right up in there and you can go on and on and home and make this as many of these or as few as you want tell you what I'm gonna get the smaller knife here I'll go back in here and play in a few little shadows right in this area see this little knife I can sneak in here and hit some of these little areas you can do the whole mountain with just the little knife if you wanted to and that together yeah very soft very quiet now he'll put us a little bit of shadow right there more in here maybe I'll put some great big evergreens in this one I want to show you how to do some beautiful big evergreens too we have time I'll just throw some of those move on right best into my same old dark color and I'm gonna bounce in just the indication of some darks here and there just hair in there just look at that look at that help me cut a little bit deeper in places creates deep recesses there we go maybe a tiniest little bit right there right there although this shows different planes different little things happening you can bounce these colors back and forth clean all kinds of illusions mmm right now with a clean brush I'm going to create a little mist right in here I'm just barely gonna tap and then just blend it all together just the bottom just the bottom I don't want to mess up the nice sharp Peaks we said earlier if you can see the entire mountain it's more distinct at the top and is at the bottom so I just want to create some nice soft areas in here there barely tap all the angles always follow the angles okay yeah if we were going to have these mountains continue I'm gonna have parts of that just have a little snow around them so you can see it go right back into this black I'm gonna had some brown into my black there we go pull it out just that little roll of paint let's go up here maybe right along here maybe this little peak we have here maybe it just comes around out what a miss see you need that dark see lighter colors will show up a movie tell you what maybe there's a big bump big rock right there wherever you want it was trust me this is black with brown in it just throwing in some some little things here daddy just tape it right down into nothing taking off all the excess paint down here at the bottom okay now going to some of the dark Sienna a little a little bit of the end blank touch your white into that not much want to stay quite dark that was kept okay yeah then just barely touch touch think about where you like it there we go there's a little bit there don't bet playing right through there here we go here's a little more mmm good fun see yeah you can just make all those little effects here we go here right there right there just drop them in over here this is just just about straight brown hair just just want to put in some basic angles I didn't disappear right in this brown wow little of it to mix with a color that's already on there some of these things just automatically happen there we go there we go okay now that tell you I'll just do let's go back into some of the white and I want to have the indication of a little snow slaying right and here just coming down look at that let it climb right up the sides and if you get a little only don't worry about it you can go right back and fix it the little knife you might find works a little better for that comes right on down here look at that see dark against light light against dark and all these beautiful little effects happen I won't take the little knife and go right in here and smooth that out so I just there there there see let he just go right on to the background okay maybe there's a little bit lays right in here just wherever you want it make make a big decision throw it in and it just goes right off into the distance little of it flows right up through there and you don't care if a little this Brown listen to you in your white doesn't make it very nice and very pretty and hear him there maybe maybe lose a little land right along in there touch of the blue and white here just a touch a little bit a few little things are happening right over in here left and I bounce and play huh okay well that's pretty much how we make some fantastic mountains and we're gonna have time to put a whole foreground here we were to get to move it along I like mountains so much I get in there and get to playing and forget that we got other things to do I just want to tap this gonna add I take one gonna add a little bit of green and a little bit of yellow little yellow ocher just right on the brush here maybe there's my happy little grassy things that live right in there touch more green they're there they're there see you're following those angles up following those angles just let them work right on wherever over here we'll follow these angles a little more the green touch a brown into that there this is a shadow side look there just helps head all those down in now think when we clean this brush it'll wash this brush they will soften it all up and be ready to play there we go just said in Windermere shows we have to have one of the funnest Levin cameramen business he's he's absolutely covered with paint he's got multi-coloured freckles left just lift it up gives it the impression from grassy hills there we go clean it all up and you can take and touch a little bit of a darker color little green here and there to show different planes see see how it just feels a whole new plane all right this hasn't fine now let's put some let's have a little rolling hill here like uses maybe up on a little plateau looking off and you can see all of this so now go into a little bit of black a little bit of green SAP green just tap the brush into it see there just tap it okay let's go up here now you got to make a big decision where does this go and in my world I'm going to have it come right here and all I'm doing is taking the brush and tapping downward maybe there's a little Valley right there and it goes up around just like after and we can begin filling this in this is where you begin creating the lay of the land right through there get a little more color on my brush ran out there and not a super way just to put a nice grassy little Hitler little more of the color and let's go back over on this side and bring this one down learning to feel left out once again here all you're doing is putting in some dark so your lighter colors will show later on it will come back it will highlight all this later okay a little more the black I wanted to get a little darker here in the foreground get closer to you landscape there you get darker add a little more of the black okay we pretty well got that filled in just like so there we are alright alright let me clean the brush if you paint along this before you know this is the most fun of the whole technique cleaning this brush do a little bit little and that's that's really fun okay we're going to use today I'm going to use a number three fan brush we'll go right into must let's go into a little yellow ocher a little CAD yellow just mix them together okay let's go ahead up here maybe right in here that's a little too bright I'm gonna put some green with it too little too bright right in here I'm pushing upward oh yeah that's nice that's nice there's a happy little evergreen leaves right there and I'm using some bright colors I want him to be pretty and strong same colors who give him a little friend trees get lonely just like we do at least I did Haley huh there we go just just push upward with a brush can you see how that's working push upward make all those happy little things drop them in you have to make a decision how many of these little trees live in your world you decide and you put them in put them in like at that hmm I like to do little trees I get carried away with them okay and we'll just put a few here in there let's say I don't stop oh I have a whole canvas covered up a little trees need to lose the painting maybe maybe there's one right there see there push up push up wherever you wanted to go ok let's start building some some little grassy areas all in here that are very pretty I'll go right into some SAP green and some yellow tap pet brush tap it tap it ok let's go up here now then let's begin determining the lay of the land now that's not quite bright enough it doesn't show I add a little bit of liquid white go right back into my color a liquid white make it a little lighter let's do it again I want you to be able to see it yeah that's much better just tap just tap don't kill all your dark areas but you be in creating all kinds of little things here we'll add a tiny bit of red to that see there look at that yeah that stands out and you can make just plane after plane hill after hill bring it all together the super super way to make a little soft meadows and little grassy areas oh just be a nice place to go lay under a big tree and read a book sleep a little while there and just spare you the colors a little bit all right layer after layer after layer look at the depth Annette though so you can create a tremendous amount of depth just just by working the different layers there's another one try this I think you'll really really enjoy it's a lot of fun but another one right there okay it's going to hit a sign here okay yeah then let's have some let's have some fun maybe go into some band-aid Browns maybe there's a happy little tree that lives right here and he's a little bigger a little stronger we can see more his trunk he's he's a strong little tree and he's got a friend right there and if you know if you hit two trees they're they're probably a third one sooner or later maybe there's one over here too for Hank but just as many trees and here's you want all I got that going I want to put the indication just here and there of a little trunk and some of these just just little indications see don't overdo just here and there can't go back to my fan brush some SAP green and some of the yellows and let's just go right in here kill it just pop on some happy little leaves like so just pop em on its nice little bright one there what really stands out nice okay put some leaves on this one yeah maybe this one back here maybe maybe he's not with us anymore I just put some old hangy down to indicate some Leone's there we go got a little too tough for him he quit on us all right let's have some fun let's have some fun I want to build up coupla huge big trees here some big strong and show you how to make those let's go right into some Van Dyck Brown watch here you have to make a decision now where's this tree lift oh I hate to go through that big mountain we will anyway we will right there just happen yes tap somebody's gonna send me a badmouth letter for going right through that mountain there we go just and I'm tapping with a brush to make it fuzzy that was so much fun let's do another one right here alright they go through there he goes hey cuz yeah same old brush I'm gonna go right into some white right into some white come right down this edge see there look there and that gives us our highlight makes a tree look around let's do the same thing to the other one don't want him to feel left out it's like so there we go give that tree some roundness there's a bit of roundness there we go let's put him up maybe it's a big old root right here on this tree and we'll just put some dark color in here that'll indicate a shadow we'll take over that a little bit later okay I'm gonna take a little bit of the liquid black put it on my pallet find my liner brush put a little thinner on it go right into the liner brush I have a little paint thinner in that it's very thin like water okay let's go up here now we need to put the indication of some little limbs here just decide wherever they're in drop them in oh right over mountains we work so hard on sorry it's alright if you learn how to make them and it wasn't wasted time what wasted yeah this put a few little hanger downs here and there there's a nice one nice big strong they live right there so I'll come right across there we go oh right over that peak okay that easy we have some nails let's put some on this other big old tree over here there it comes helps to make little sounds see here there is a big limb come lives right there if you'll hang you down zone there evergreens always heavies old I call them hanging downs I don't really know what they are that's as good a word as any until we find a better one look at there there we are okay say we just put all these in here that the blonde you always have open broken ones on there yeah then go ahead into the liquid height you can add a little bit of highlight here and there make it rascal stand out but light against the dark again by eight against a dark up here and a little bit there we go just a little bit just a little over here a tiny bit see it just adds a little bit to your painting makes it look a little better a little more detail and come right across apparently genell has put some just put some happy little leaves on there and we'll take our number-3 fan brush let me clean it office full of paint okay and I'll go right into SAP green we ran into SAP green and some black okay let's go ahead up here now you don't have to have leaves on all of these just touch push ended up word I just want leaves on some of them look at there a hole right over our mountain right over the mountain there we go there do you think you live that's really do case go to the other tree a few little happy things on him just like so thanks wherever wherever and we were right into a little bit of CAD yellow because it's got a lot of green on here we drop them in hope you enjoyed this - fantastic little painting ever really show you how to do these mountains yeah get this one all finished here and I'll call this one die and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting see you next time
