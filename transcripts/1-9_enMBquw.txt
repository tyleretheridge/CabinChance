(soft music) - Hello, I'm Bob Ross and
I'd like to welcome you to the 23rd Joy of Painting series. First of all, let me thank
you for inviting me back for another series of painting shows. And if this is your first
time with us, let me extend a personal invitation
for you to drag out your brushes and a few
paints and paint along with us each show and I'll
teach you how to put some of nature's masterpieces on canvas. I tell you what, let's start out today and have them run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, come on up here and let me show you what
I've got started already. I have my standard old
pre-stretched double primed canvas up here
and today I've covered it with a thin, even coat of
liquid clear and liquid white mixed together because
I want somewhat of a semi-transparent sky in this one. So I put a little clear in there just to, just so that will happen. So I tell you what, let's
just start out today and do a beautiful little, maybe
we'll do a winter scene today. And let's see what happens. So let's start, we'll use
a little two inch brush. We'll go right into a
very small amount of the phthalo blue, very small
amount, don't need much. Just pulling a bit out and tap
the bristles into the color. See, that assures a nice,
even distribution of color all the way through
the bristles and that's exactly what we're looking for. So, let's go up here. Maybe we'll have a nice,
light area right up here in the sky and let's see what happens, Let's just take this
and go right up in here with a little bit of the phthalo blue and we just do something,
sort of like that. Sort of like that. We just do a very simple
painting today but I think you'll find very effective
and a great deal of fun to do. There, maybe something like, like that. That's all we need. And I have it slightly off
center, I don't want it directly in the center of the canvas. Slightly off center. But as you can see the
paint continually mixes with the liquid white
and liquid clear that we have on the canvas and automatically we get this beautiful blending effect. If we were doing this on a dry canvas, we'd be in agony city already. But this makes it work. It's a lazy man's way of painting. Okay, now then without cleaning the brush, we'll go right into a
small amount and very small amount because it's
strong of the prussian blue. I want a little darker
blue this time, I'm going from the phthalo right into the prussian. So we have a graduation of
color into darker, darker blues. Then we can go right up in here and once again, we'll
just add a little bit of that blue right around here. Like so, and just let it blend outward. We want this to be the lightest area and get progressively darker
as we work outward. Okay, add a little bit
more of the prussian blue and we'll go to the other side here and do exactly the same thing. Something about like so. There we are. But once again, this is
mixing with a liquid white and the liquid clear that's
on the canvas and this beautiful blending effect
will happen automatically. Now then, I want it to get even
darker as it works outward. So I'll take prussian blue and I'll mix that with a small amount
of midnight black. So we have blue and
black or black and blue, whatever your preference. There we go. And back up to the canvas. See how much darker that is because we put that little bit of black in there. And we'll just finish filling up the sky. Just like that, it didn't
take long when you're using that big old two inch brush. Doesn't take very long. Okay, add a little bit more of the color, the blue and the black and we'll go to the other side and we'll fill it up. Just like so. Okay, now then, now comes the fun part. Let me wash the old brush
and if you've painted with me before you know
this is the most exciting part of the whole technique
because this is where I get even with everybody
here in the studio. We shake off the excess and
just beat the devil out of it. And that really, that's
where you take out all your frustrations and hostilities
and that's the fun part of it. Now then, with a good, clean dry brush we can just begin blending this. I just want to blend it so
you can't tell where one color stops and the next color starts. Just blend it til it's very, very soft. There we go. Now I beat the brush just
to take off the excess paint you've picked up off the canvas. It's easier than going through
the whole cleaning procedure. And it will clean your brush right off. Alright, we can just wipe
it down in here because if we have a little color
down in here, I think I'll have a little snow
down in here and that will just end up being
shadows in the snow. We're not really worried about it. Cause you know, we don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents. You learn to work with anything that happens in this technique. We don't use any patterns,
we don't do any drawing. We just sort of let it happen. We let it happen and very quickly you learn to create on canvas. Okay, let me wash the old brush again. I just like to wash the brush. Now then, I'm going to go right into some titanium white with the
old two inch brush here and just load a little color
right on the brush here. And let's go right up in here. I want to make this very bright. Right here, this is going
to be our light area, let's start right in
here putting in some of that titanium white and
let it blend outward. Let it blend outward, it
will mix with all those beautiful blues, black
colors that we have in there. Start in the light area and work outward. Outward, outward, outward. Something like so. I'm going to beat the brush. Once again, just take off the excess paint and blend out this direction. Now, like that. Now then, sometimes, let me
wash the old brush again. I'll show you something that's really fun. Sometimes it's nice to load
a little white, little bit of the titanium white,
then I'll reach right over here be right back, right back. Get a least, I'll say it again least little touch of cadmium yellow. Just want to sparkle
this, maybe a touch more. There, that's beautiful. Just want to put a little bit
of yellow right up in here. Now, don't put too much
yellow because of the yellow against the blue will turn green. In this particular painting,
we're not looking, we're not looking for a bring green sky. I just want a little, a little yellow flavor right up in here. There. And we once again will blend that outward. Now you can do this as
many times as you desire to create a desired lightness. You can go over it, and
over it, and over it. But I would recommend
that each time you clean and dry the brush so you
don't drag the dark color back into this beautiful
light center here. Okay, just knock off that
exess paint once again and we'll blend out in
the other direction. There, that easy. That easy. That's all there is to it. And then very lightly,
two hairs and some air. Just very gently, go right across it. And we have a very nice
little light area in here and that will be our light source
in this particular painting. Okay, there we go, get the
old brush good and clean. Now then, let's have some more fun. Let's take a little white,
little bit of the black, little bit of the prussian blue. We'll just mix this
color right on the brush. Something I'm looking
for a blue gray color. Something about like so. I'm going to tap the brush, so I'm sort of pushing forward like that
and getting a little, little bit of color right out here
on the end of the bristles. Let's go up here. Now maybe back in here
there's some beautiful little footie heals that live in here. In our world maybe, yup, you're right. They live right along in here. And by just using the
corner of the brush and tapping we can put the indication of all kinds of little things back in here. We just sort of let them
blend right on out into, they just sort of fade away into nothing. Very soft, very gentle,
quiet, just beautiful little things that live back in here. Right into the sun. There we go. Now then very lightly
lift it up in little tiny, tiny short strokes, tiny
little short strokes. Just lifting upward, upward like that. It will give the
indication of little trees that live way back in the
distance far, far away. Now then, let me grab another brush. I have several of each one. We'll take a tiny, tiny bit of white. I want to create the illusion of a nice misty area right in here. Just a little white, titanium white and we'll just tap a little. Just tap a little. So we have a nice soft area in there. Then I'll take the same color. Just black with a little
prussian blue in it, load it back on that brush
just like we did before. And maybe, right in here, yup. Maybe there's another doer
that lives right in here. See. But that little misty
area right in between is what separates your layer,
it's all it takes is a small misty area and as
you know as things get closer to you in a landscape they should get darker and darker in value. There, lift upward once again. I'll tell you what, let me
show you, let me show you. I get carried away sometime. Let's take a little more of the black, a little more of the prussian blue, a little touch of white,
make that same color. I'm just putting it on the fan brush. As you paint like this
you begin seeing things. I just see a wonderful place here. Maybe, maybe maybe. There's some bigger
trees, yeah, right there. Just tap with the fan
brush and pull downward. Give it a little downward pull. And we'll make the
indication of a lot of little trees that live right
up here on this hill. That easy. That easy. Just tap them, it's all it takes. It's all it takes, maybe
they just sort of blend out over here into nothing,
we don't know where it goes. Don't know that we care. There, back to my old two inch brush that had that color on it. And we just sort of bring that down so it all comes together. Very soft, there we are. See how easy that is, don't be afraid of this brush because it's large. It will do wonderful,
wonderful things for you. All you need is a little bit of practice, an idea in your mind and off you go. It's really all it takes. There are no secrets here
that we don't give you. You really can do this. Everyday I get letters
from people from all over the country that
say you told me that I could do this and I tried
it and you're right, I can do it, I really can do this. Alright, now then. Time to start making
some big decision here. Let me wash the old brush again. I just like to wash the brush. There. Now then, maybe back in here we'll begin to have a little snow. We said we's going to have a winter scene so I'll take white,
just titanium white but maybe we'll put the
least, least little touch of that cad yellow into it. Since we had a little of that
in the sky, maybe a little of that will be reflecting
into the snow back there. But see I just loaded the brush by pulling it through the paint. So there's a little paint in
both sides, let's go up here. Now then, you have to make major decision. Maybe our snow lives, yup, right there. And all you do is pull. When you're painting snow, angles are extremely, extremely important. So, pay attention to the
lay of the land here, how you want this snow to flow. There now I want it to
come slightly downward but not a great deal,
just so it looks like there's a little incline there. And by pulling those
strokes in that direction, that will happen automatically. Automatically, you don't
have to worry about it, just think about the angle
that you have in here. There, a little shadow right in here. Take a little of that gray
color and pull in back in this direction and I'll
show you why in just a second. Let them blend together so
you have a little shadow area. There. Now then. Maybe in our world, go
back to the plain white. Maybe in our world we'll have. Yup, how about right here. We'll change the angle and let
it come right through, see? See, see, there it is. Just pull it, you can do anything in your world that you want to do. That easy. By changing this angle,
we have a whole different plain in that painting and it pushes that and that and that way back further. And plains in a painting,
different plains, each one of these is a plain. Not an airplane going by. Each one of these plains
helps create that illusion of depth and distance in your painting. And I like a lot of depth
and distance in my paintings. I think that's what makes
painting spectacular. Oh, I just had another idea. This little hill here, let's do this. Let's do this, let's do. Take a little of the
prussian blue with the black, mix it together, want
this to be pretty dark, I'm only putting a small
amount of white in this. Maybe a little darker
than the background color. A little bit more white, there we go. And you can just mix
these colors on the brush once again, don't worry about it. Just mix them on the brush. Let's go up in here. Maybe on this little hill there lives a happy little tree. Right here, right there, there. If you've painted with me before you know I have a lot of little
squirrels and other animals that live with me and this will
be a good place for my little squirrel he can sit
up here and look all out over the countryside and
see what was happening. And my little squirrel certainly is nosy, he'd want to, he'd want to know. Maybe later on in the show
we'll show you those again. Right now I have five of
them that live with me. There. Sometimes that's worse
than having five children. We'll have another little
tree over here, what the heck. But all you're using is
the corner of the fan brush and you just sort of push downward. Just push downward like that. And as you work down the tree, you push harder and harder because you want the branches and limbs to
get larger and larger. Now down here at the
bottom, all you gotta do is take a little touch of this
white on the two inch brush. Grab a little of that
color, intentionally grab the color because that will make a shadow. Right underneath, see? And just pull it. It will give that little
tree a place to sit on there. You don't want him sitting on
there just sort of floating. There and once again begin thinking about angles in your snow, there we are. See there, now you can
take, maybe there's a little bush or two, maybe there's
a grassy area just foots. Take that same color and just sort of push upward a little bit. That will help create that illusion. And you can grab and clean up that little grassy area on the bottom there same way until you have it just as smooth as silk. There. And let's take our knife,
we'll use the old knife here. We'll just put the indication
of a little trunk here. I don't want a lot of detail, this is too far away in my world. Just some indication, see
we just pull through and we'll turn a few trees and
the whole forest back here. Scratch through the paint and
it will give the indication of a little trunk here and there. Maybe there's a little stick
or twig, whatever, whatever. Let's get crazy. You know me. This will be a wonderful place if my little squirrels gonna live there. I'd have to have a house
too so let's come right in here, let's have us a cabin right here. Now, one of the easiest
ways, take your knife and I might not be able to see that but scrape out the basic shape. That does two things, it
allows you to lay out your little cabin without
being committed and it removes excess paint so the
next layer goes on easier. See there but you can scrape
out the whole basic little shape and you're still not
committed at this point. There we are, now then. Let's take, let's take
a little bandit brown. We load that little bit
of paint on the knife by pulling it out flat and cutting across it. Let's do a back E back here. Just bandit brown is all it is. Pull down, here we go. Give a nice little side there. Over here, just pull down. There. And if you haven't painted with us before, one thing that I should mention, the paint that we use is extremely firm, it is much firmer than traditional oil paints. Much, much firmer. That's the only reason
we can paint wet on wet. In other words, do the whole
painting while it's still wet. If you put a very firm
paint up here first, then you can put thinner
colors right on the top of it without becoming a mud mixer. If you've painted before,
all of us have experienced a little mud mixing, it just
comes with the territory. Nobody has a monopoly on mud mixing. We all get a chance at it. Take a little vandike and
white and mix it together. See how flat you pull it out,
as flat as you can get it. Cut across, I mean we
have a tiny roll of paint. There you can see it wonderful, right on the edge of the knife there. Lives right out there
and very lightly touch and just let it float just
so it's barely touching. I want this side to be lighter
than the backside back here. Barely touch. Maybe there's a, maybe
there's some boards here. We'll just take some vandike
brown and just touch, make the indication of some little boards. Over here we need a
few, something like so. There. And maybe we have a
little window or two here. We'll just take the small edged knife and sort of scrape this out a
little window indication. Then I'll use a little
of the midnight black, nobody's home today. Or he didn't pay his electric bill. Don't see any wires running
to his house anyway, so. There, I'll give him a little
door so he can get in and out. But when you're painting make
up little stories like it. You know you're family and
friends will look at you like you're a little
weird but that's alright. Artists are expected to be a
little, a little different. But it really helps you, if
you make up little stories then you can see these
things in your mind. And anything that you can see in your mind very quickly, you can
learn to put on canvas. Here we're just doing a cabinectomy. In other words, we're cutting
off whatever we don't want to get our perspective
and everything right. Now we have a roof that we need to put on. So, we'll take the white,
pull it out very flat. Here's a little trick. You're gonna get your
edges nice and straight. Just lay the edges all in first using the straight edge of the knife,
excuse my arm for a second. There, and this will make it a little easier when you pull down. See now everything will
be straight on the edges. There, there are no firm rules in this. I only want to show you
ways that things will work. As you paint everyday,
you're going to find new ways that are much better
than what I am showing you. Use them, painting is an individual thing. If it works for you, then it's wonderful. That's really all that matters, if you're happy with it
and it's what you wanted, that's the only rule. The only rule is that you
really should enjoy this. Just take a little white, bring it right up to the cabin there. Like so we'll bring a
little right in here. Like that. Angle, alright. Over in here a little touch of that shadow color, a little
blue, a little black and just sort of blend them together. There. Alright. Let's really have some fun now. I've got several little fan brushes going. I want to mix up a crazy
color here, I love this color. We're going to take a little
crimson and sap green. In equal parts, mix them very well. Normally we don't mix color too well. For this color, mix it very, very well. Very well and it makes a gorgeous brown. Just absolutely a gorgeous brown. Let me wipe the old knife off. I just wipe the knife
on a paper towel here. Okay and we just run the old fanbrush right though it, load both sides. Full of color, a lot of paint. Now then maybe in our world there lives, let's start it, you know
me, if you paint with me before I like these old big trees. Something like so. Maybe he's got another arm. Comes right down, oh I said big tree. We gonna have a big tree. Maybe there's even an arm back here. Like that. Where do you think they should be. This piece of canvas is totally your world and you can do anything
here that you want to do. Take a little of brown we
made, mix it with some white. That is just one of the
most gorgeous brown colors. It sounds horrible when you talk about green and red mixed together. A little roll of paint. There's our light and in
our world maybe there's just a little light sitting
in right through here like so. I'm just touching the canvas
with that little roll of paint. Just touch the canvas
will pull off what it wants and give you back what's left. There, just where ever you think light will sing through here. Something about like so. Now you could make this entire tree with a knife if you wanted to, it's up to you. It's a little faster with a fan brush. There we go, a little bit over here. Where ever, where ever. Now then, let's firm up this dark edge and just let the knife bounce
and graze and barely touch. You want this to be rough,
when it dries, this will actually feel like bark on there. If you just let it boune and graze. There. Okay, something like so. There we are. Now then, let's go to
our little liner brush. Who will use a script liner brush. Put some paint thinnner on the brush. We want to thin this paint. Quite a bit of paint thinnner. I want this to be thin like ink. And roll the bristles in there and pull it out so they come out very, very sharp. Okay, now then let's go right in here and think about where some little tree limbs would live on this tree. But your paint should
literally flow on here. Should literally just flow. And if it doesn't, add a little more of the paint thinner. If it's not flowing,
normally that's the problem. Normally that's the problem. There. Maybe there's a big ole worm here that comes right on across. There we are. But you let your tree go
where ever you want it to go. Just move it around and play and carry on. Something like so. There. Now, we can just dip
that clean brush right into a little bit of
liquid white put a little snow right around the bottom here. There, sort of fill that in. Tell you what, let's do. Let's take a little more
of that brown color. Maybe there's what remains
of a little fence right here. Something like so. All we do is touch. Come right across, put
a little more, maybe there's a little thing there. Little bit of that white
right along the edge. Put it right on there. Okay, take a little touch, maybe a little shadow right there in the snow. Something like so. And we'll just put the
indication of a little path here. With that, I think this whole painting will be about finished. Hope you try this one. It's very simple, you'll enjoy it. You'll have fantastic results. So with that, I think we're
gonna call this one finished. And from all of us here,
I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless my friend. (upbeat music)
