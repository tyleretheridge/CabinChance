hi glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic painting together well let's get started let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let's go on up here we've got the canvas set up we have it covered with a thin even coat of liquid white and it's all ready so let's get started start out today with a 2 inch brush go right into a little tiny tiny bit of the phthalo blue and we reach over here and grab a little bit of the midnight black and then I'm going to go down here and the least little touch of yellow ochre so we have blue black and little yellow ochre let's go right up to the canvas here let's put us in a happy little sky today just use a little crisscross strokes let it just sort of float across the canvas just make all those happy little things maybe skip a space and then we'll come down here we'll have a cloud or two in there just sort of skip a space and go for I don't like it okay well we have that brush going a little water today we're going to do the little animated opening that's the little painting that you see go fit button it at the beginning of the show so I'll show you how that one was done all right it was a little water in it so we want a little touch of water right here now this may not be an exact duplicate of the opening but it'll show you how it was made they give me quite a bit of time to paint that and then some fantastic people animate it they do that one frame at a time so it just sort of comes alive there we go okay and that'll be our water right in there already I'll wash the brush give it a good scrub shake it off beat the devil out of it cover everybody in the studio here I'm going to go right into right into titanium white pull that brush through the paint I get a lot of paint on it let's make a happy little cloud up in the skies go right up here and we'll just work in a little cloud I don't want a big bright cloud just one a tiny little cloud floats right around here it has some funny just sort of working man this is just straight titanium white little circles see there and we'll have another little cloud lives right here clouds just sort of float around and have fun so they're free they're really free they wear that quick that quick we have a happy look cloud in the sky now with a clean brush and I have several of each brush go inside I'll have to spend a lot of time washing all of them just blend it out a little little circles give it a fluff and if you remember that little painting at the beginning of each Hill there's not a whole bunch of sky it's going to be left showing so we don't have to worry a great deal about it today knock off the excess paint there blend it out and we're ready to go that quick we have a happy little sky now that makes a little background trees for that it would take a little touch of Prussian blue midnight black shoot go through a little brown in there too a little touch of the yellow ochre just a small amount of the ochre it'll turn green don't you and let's pull a little bit out into that I'm going to add titanium white there we go pound it maybe a little more white just like so that's good color okay clean off my knife here today let's use the old fan brush we'll load it full of paint a lot of paint both sides just go right up here we had some little background evergreens just start off take the brush and just sort of work back and forth back and forth back and forth see put in the centers and put in as many or as few as you want and then come back that easy and turn all those little little sticks into happy little evergreens and these are far away so you're not looking for a lot of detail back here no I'm looking for a great deal there and oh there's another one there's another one and you could make these with a one-inch brush works very well to express their same same way just load the brush to a chisel edge take off there we go let's have one more right there what the heck there's so much fun you start to get carried away little the bad easy that easy you can make a whole little forest now we can tap that just tap it give it a little upward lift it'll create an illusion of mist and fog all kinds of pretty little things take the same color I'm gonna add a little touch of the little touch of the Van Dyck Brown to it tiniest little mouth tap the brush into it let's go out up here there and we'll make a little little bit of land comes right down through there and this helps sort of push everything back creates another plane in your painting creates that illusion of depth that we talk about all the time it's very important in painting now while we have this on the brush grab it just pop it straight down just give it a snap look see there some over here then very lightly very lightly go across hmm and we have instant reflections that easy Adam let me take a little liquid height pull that out cut across it let's go right up here and we'll just cut us in um using a very firm pressure here we'll just cut in some happy little water lines that easy there we go little and right in here wherever you want to go now maybe see look here we know there's going to be a tree there so you put one there and it'll look like there's something happening there but you don't have to waste a lot of time you'll understand a little better when I go further it'll make sense I'm not I'm not totally crazy sometimes I doubt that there we go now then we can begin building onto this so let's take take a to inspiration we'll go right into some Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna just sort of work them together maybe pick up a little black what the heck whatever makes you happy we looking just basically for a dark color right up in here we had a bush to our tree starts out as a bush and if it gets big enough then we call it tree and trees will cover put multitude of sins there your friends say that brings that whole corner together that easy a little more of the color see now that projects out and it makes it look like it goes back around that easy sneaky huh while we have is on the brush once again let's just tap it downward and we can create we can create a happy little reflection that easy that easy I used to be a traditional painter now would work as hard making these reflections as you can believe I had worked myself to death try to make them shoot reflections are one of the nicest things that happens I'm going back into a good old dark color let's come right in here and let's add a little damp comes out see you right there all right there just drop it right in shoot all we have a little brush go I miss just keep going here let's just keep it going it was a big strong tree it lives here now sometimes you can get carried away and just cover up the whole canvas and that's alright as long as you practice if there's a secret to painting it certainly is practice that's the only secret to this because we show you everything you need to know here to do fantastic paintings all you need to do is take what we give you practice a little bit and just do all kinds of unbelievable things straight down across and that quick we have happy little reflection there and then I want to take here's my other brush this was a same old color we made these trees out of let's just come back in here behind in here it K some of these shows through and we'll make the indication of distant distant trees these are far far away a couple of those may show through a couple of them may not we made this cover them up who knows would take some brown now let's come right in here and we can just shouldn't just paint this on this bike was painting the barn just not a lot of thought about paint it off this is going to be our path remember there's a little path in there just like so and we had all kinds of happy little things growing along the path and all we're doing here is just blocking in color we're just blocking it and we'll come back and go put all the little the little highlights and little little sparklers in there another little tree lives right there see there that quick you can block in an entire painting and all we're doing is just putting in the dark gotta have the dark so the light will show all right maybe maybe maybe maybe right down in here I want that to be a little good dark a lot of shadows under there a lot of shadows okay we're moving right along here don't this was a fun little painting I like this painting take the liner brush with thinner on it go right into our Van Dyck Brown you want this paint to be thin then like ink pull it out turning it bring it to a nice point okay now then let's go right in here and just put the indication here and there of a happy little tree trunk and a limb or two here and there like so there we go there one there wherever wherever wherever tell you what maybe I think there was yeah it was a big tree and right there and we just pulled that right straight down then let's put a few little limbs on it like that see there say the little limbs are and you put as many or as few as you want in there this is your tree so you have to make the big decision are there a few limbs lot of limbs no limbs whatever any way you want it you can do it you can do it just like so and you could even even in here see most of these will be covered up but maybe a couple of them will show through and it looked like you have all kinds of little details in your painting now when I'm doing these sometimes I pull down sometimes I pull upward just whichever way feels right whichever way works for you that's the way to do it that's the way there is one see all their little sticks and those but they don't get smaller as they go back in accretes already you're beginning to see distance in this painting already just by putting those few little sticks and twigs you looks like you could go back in there and we won't fit 'old around here for just a second can you watch the old liner brush off let's begin playing here okay grab the old two-inch brush let's go into some yellows and yellow ocher reach over here and I'll grab it touch of the touch of the brain grant and load the brush full of paint just tap it tap the tap okay let's go right back up here let's begin putting some beautiful fall colors on some of these trees see all you do just use the corner of the brush and make little clumps little little patterns here don't just hit it random sort of think about what you're doing and look at it see the little clumps that's what separates the tree gives it individuality practice that a little bit because that's what will make your tree stand out it really make it spectacular down here we have all kinds of little bushes just all kinds of them shoots here's a nice one and you do layer after layer after layer do one bush at a time don't get in a big hurry and try to do them all at once there you go and do you could do it now you can do it now once in a while dip your brush into a little bit of paint thinner that will then you paint down and make it stick easier if you want to break by here put some very bright highlights like that little boy stand out just dip it a little thinner so it sticks nice and easy and wherever you had to make those big decisions and it may be over here there some more see all those little things that's the way they go maybe back in here now I want these to be very loose because I don't want to lose all those see all those little sticks create distance I don't want to lose those these are very loose they're just little things just sort of floating around back here we don't even see exactly what they're connected to right those pretty and you can do all of this with just a big ol two-inch brush you could also do it with a one-inch brush or the round brush just want to show you they what you could do with a big brush oh there's a nice sparkler that's a pretty son of a gun look at that see and work forward forward forward forward always coming forward always working forward layer after layer Bush after Bush and that's how you create the distance in your painting I know you're tired of hearing me say that but that's to me is what what makes good paintings paintings that have distance and depth I look for that in paintings there we go there see that look how much distance is showing there just because we layered it and went back back back cake just put some dirt in there I need something for all that to settle don't want to fall in the water make a big splash just plain or Van Dyke Brown here look at that just sort of bounce it along at the canvas pull off what it wants it'll give you back what's left wherever you want it to be see you can do it and we'll take some white a little dark sienna some touch a blue and just mix it a little bit don't over mix it just just enough so there's sort of marbling and then you can go up here and just sort of let this bounce along and play and create all kinds of little things looks like little stones and hills and bumps and just wherever where and maybe where you live maybe stones and rocks and dirt has a different color net so you change the colors to match what you want all we want to do here show you how what you do is up to you those painting is oh it's not it's an individual thing it should make you happy should set you free and I think if you like me we're all looking for freedom we're looking for an escape some place some place that's nice no pollution nobody's mad it's a happy place it's a happy place and that's what you create on your canvas is a happy place talk too much and brush a little SAP green to throw in there yeah ellos just whatever happened down here load that brush fo let's go up here now then let's follow right down look at there just push upward see use the corner of the brush if you use the whole brush you're going to get smiley faces you start getting smiley faces turn your brush more to the corner more to the corner Kenny over here put in a few little things think what let's put some dirt over here this sides getting left out there he comes there it goes see there maybe some of it sneaks right on back up in there some highlights dark Sienna white a little touch of blue here and there very little blue though just want to gray it the blue is just just a gray it just a gray it a little liquid white come right in here see there put a little water line in there shoot you can do it that quick then we come right in for their fan brush and bring all this together and then need to all right little bushes hanging over maybe there's a couple little things that live right here and just sort of hang over wherever you want wherever you want okay tell you what let's do let's play with a path now I want to make it look like there's a little bit of light that's just singing through here and hitting right back here so I'm going to use almost pure white because it'll mix with a brown it'll mix with a brown then I'll get darker darker darker as it comes around I want to add a little touch of dark CNN there start blending not all together maybe a little light singing through there that's one of them happy accidents there see just bring it right I don't know if like that now that man let me take a wash my fan brush here dry it off on a paper towel now very lightly just want to barely touch just caress the canvas I want to just bring all this together this is a thick paint so you can do this and get away with it see see how smooth that brings it all in without destroying you don't lose all these things you just blend them in and soften it okay now then we can go back let's bring all kinds of little happy bushes that hang right over the path and that'll push the path right down into the painting so it fits see there and now now you feel like it belongs there and you can put as many or as few whatever she wanna get this brush gonna add a little a little rid so I don't make an orange color and back up in here just barely touching so put the indication of all kinds a little little things happening back up in this big tree there they go see him just little indications we're not looking for a lot of detail here most of this also will be covered up because we're gonna put some big fantastic trees in there big old trees I'm going back into some dark paint this is the blue and black a little tiny bit of SAP green on the fan brush in the opening we had a little evergreen that lived right here believe right about it now slowly just drop him right in if he lives right in front of that tree like that and a little tree trunk Oni we can put a few little grassy things in front of him that'll push it back into the painting okay let's do some let's do some big trees shoot that time to really get crazy in here Van Dyke Brown on the fan brush a lot of paint let's go ahead up here okay mmm if you don't make it noise it won't work there's one tree there one tree there and you can put as many or as few as you want here's a big sound we got big ol tree the agel tree and we'll give him a friend great big tree and right over here one more tree now let's take some titanium white and just grab this pull it right around see here there we go just put some bark on that tree just bark up some dogs a spark some on that one just give it a pull here some on this tree here up we go some on the other side like that now you can just work out together there now back to our liner brush backdoor liner brush I'll go right into Van Dyck Brown and let's put a few little Amazon these trees here we go you want this paint to be very very thin almost like water you want to so thin that it just flows and drop in however many limbs you want just drop them in you know I'd like to thank all the people who have wrote sentence cards and letters and we get we get hundreds of ideas for people all over the country they send us photographs or or postcards or stuff they'd like to see painted and that's where a lot of the ideas for these paintings come from is from people all over and I use those ideas I'd like to hear what it is that you want painted let us know if you don't tell us we have to guess there see there and the paints then you can just put as many of these in as you want just drop them in there and we don't want this little tree to be left out give him a few little limbs out here now these sort of look like birch trees and if in your painting you wanted to be oaks or whatever maybe you wanted maples in your tree so it looks like you're you do that put them in it's your world and you really can do anything go take a little white and put in a few little little doers right here look like little sticks and twigs just put them in see that easy put in all cans up hand it off a little bit paint off my big brush I'm going to go right in and we get a little little paint thinner on my brush so the paint's thin CAD yellow just tap my big brush and let's go in here and drop in some beautiful beautiful little leaves that are just on these trees here and just use the very corner of the brush put in as many as you want here's some over here that I'm float around wherever you think they should be and the old clock on the wall is telling me I better stop for today so I've just dropped in a few more leaves tell you how much I enjoyed painting this for you today and I look forward to seeing you again and from all of us here happy painting god bless you
