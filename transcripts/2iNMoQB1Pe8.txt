- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, and I thought today
we'd maybe do something just a little different, and I really believe you'll enjoy it. So let's start out and
have run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. and they'll come across right there. While they're doing that, let me show you what you
all will be doing up here, I have my standard old 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched canvas. And I take a little black
gesso and a paper towel, And I just sort of daubed. I know I want a big tree here and here, And other than that, I really don't care. I've allowed the black
gesso to dry completely. Now, on top of that,
I'm adding a mixture of liquid clear, midnight black, and a little bit of titanium white. In other words, I want
a very thin gray color. And I'm going to cover most of this with just this very thin gray color. And I'll just finish doing
that here real quick. And all we do is just sort of scrub it in. Like so, but this is an
extremely thin paint. Liquid clear with gray. Just black and a little
bit of titanium white. Not like, yeah, that's
really all I'm looking for. OK, and the whole canvas has been covered with that mixture. So that just gives us a
little background color to play with. Sometimes we use liquid clear by itself. Sometimes we mix color with it, and today that's what we're gonna do. Let me wash the old brush. That's the fun part of
this whole technique. We wash it with odorless thinner, shake off the excess, [rattling] (laughs) and then just
beat the devil out of it. Now then, I want to add a
few little hints of color here and there, and I tell you what, first I'm gonna take the
thin paint off my palette, and lay it aside somewhere. Cause I don't wanna thin any
of my other paints out with it. We put the thin paint on
there just so everything's nice and slick and color
blends on the canvas. And the gray will help us mute or dull all the colors in this
particular painting. Take a small, very small amount of alizarin crimson. Really be stingy with it, I
don't want but a tiny bit. Here and there, and there and here, I just wanna change the flavor
of this gray a little bit. Just to make the painting
a little more interesting. Little crimson here and there, like so. Maybe like there's a little nice warm little splotch
shining through there. I don't know, whatever you want. And you can use any color
that makes you feel good. There. Hm, maybe, tell you what, even
maybe the least little bit of the sap green. It really doesn't matter,
but a very small amount. Just want some little splotches of color here and there. (brushing) All right. Maybe something about like that. (brushing) And, I'm even gonna touch the least, least little bit of phthalo
blue once in a while. (brushing) And we just sort of blend that. But once again, the gray
color that we put on at first will tone all of that down. There. (brushing) And we just have a lot of
little colors happening in various parts of the painting. There we go. Maybe even a little crimson over in here. It's really up to you. You make the big decisions, what you want and where you want it. (brushing) Now then, a little titanium white right on the same brush. And take the white, and
I'll put right in here. I wanna create the illusion of soft, very soft misty area
back behind these trees. So the white will mix with that gray, and you can see what's happening already. It gives that illusion. And you could use the
liquid black and do this. That could work probably just as well, I just have this handy, and
that's what I'm using today. Just a liquid black
would work just as well. Might even be easier, who knows? Try it and see. There we are. (brushing) Something like that. And maybe a little bit over in here, I want that mist just to sort
of float behind these trees. There. I like very soft little misty paintings. They just do nice things for you. (brushing) OK. Kinda brighten that a little
bit more right in there. Right in there. Want that to be the softest area here. And it'll also have a
tendency to bring your eye right there, when you're looking
at the finished painting. And that's where we want you to look, so that's that we put that in there. Now see, some of these things
would have been like gesso. See the little spots and stuff? They will show right
through that painting, just transparent enough
to allow it to show. When the painting's
done, people with think you spent tremendous amounts of time painting each one of these
little details in there. And you don't have to tell them you did it just with a paper towel,
just daubing it like that. That's our secret. OK. (brushing) Enough of that. Now then, let me grab one of the, the little half size round brushes. And I'm gonna take, I'm gonna take some Prussian blue, very strong blue. Don't take much. Some alizarin crimson, make sort of a lavender color. Much, much more crimson
than blue, proportionately. Much, much more. Like so. There. OK, let me wipe off the old knife here. And we just wipe the
knife on a paper towel, just cleaned off, or a soft rag. Whatever you happen to have. I'm gonna load this little round brush by just tapping it right into the color. Just tap it. And let's go right back in here. Let's start with this tree. OK, now I don't wanna kill all of these, I want some of those to
remain in the painting. So they're very special. Take care of those. I want to save some of
them, retain some of those. There we go. Now let's just tap in a very
very basic little tree shape. This is just sort of
a lavender-like color, very dark, it could almost be black. You could do it in black if you wanted to. No problem. There, something about like that. (staccato brushing) OK, now we're looking for
here is just general shapes. Once again, don't look
for a lot of detail. We'll worry about detail
in the foreground. All right, here we just
want it to look like a big old tree that's hanging out and just having a good time here. It doesn't take a lot of color, because you have the
black gesso underneath. The black gesso may be
one of the neatest things that we've ever came up with. And we originally were gonna develop all kinds of color gessos,
yellow and all that, but it's very easy to take
a little acrylic paint, and put with your white gesso, and make any color gesso that you want. But it's difficult to take white gesso and try to make black. So that's the reason we made black gesso. Anybody can make gesso in other colors. Once again, just a little
acrylic paint and gesso and you can make anything that you want. All right, now then. Take the little liner
brush, little paint thinner, and go right into that same color. And I want this to be
thin, almost like ink. So you can see it's literally
running on the palette. But it's the same identical color. Let's go up here. Here and there, and there and here, I just wanna put a few, not many, a few little indications
of some little tree trunks down the stalks, whatever
you wanna call them. Some little things that live
in the middle of the tree and they hold it up, keep
it from falling over. Don't want it to fall
over, make a big noise. There, and some back in here
that you can't hardly see. They should be very quiet. They shouldn't stand out real strong. I want them to be very subdued. There we go. Just all kinds of little
things that live back in there. And you decide how many there are and where they live, and all of that. OK, maybe we should just
use that same old brush. Probably run into a little,
little caddy yellow, Be get right back, get
a bit of midnight black, I want it darker. Oh yeah, that's very nice. Black and yellow make a
beautiful green color. And once again, all you do is tap. Pick up a little yellow
ochre, little Indian yellow. Just mix all the yellows
and the black together, makes a beautiful green, OK. Now then maybe in our
world, maybe right in here. But not a great deal of
color, it's too far away. Too far away, maybe
there's just all kinds of little bushes that live way back in here. Maybe there's a bigger one. I don't want these very distinct. Quiet. Quiet little bushes, shh. (brushing) There they come, maybe they
just hang right out over here. So that sort of looks like a natural place for there to be a, I know,
I know, I know, I get it. You begin seeing things
when you do this, watch. Let's, let's make some brown. Sap green, good old sap green. And alizerin crimson,
and about equal parts. Makes a gorgeous brown. There we go, sap green, alizerIn crimson. And you could take it to the
red side or the green side, depends on the mood you're in that day or what you're trying to achieve. There, today I'm going to have it a little touch to the red side. Cut off a tiny little roll of paint. And maybe I go right in here, maybe there's shoot, maybe
there's a little bank right here. Little bank down here in the woods, place for all the little
creatures to put their money. There we go. And I'm just really taking
the knife and using it flat and pushing that, and rubbing it in, so it goes right into the fabric. Really wanna grind it in there. There. Now, a little titanium white
and some of that same color. And the least little touch of it. And I wanna cut right back in here. And just touch, and then
the more you rub it, the darker it'll become. I don't want this to be too bright, too distinct, yet. It's
too far in the background. So you can put it on this very bright, and then you rub it a
little with the knife. And you can just soften it right on down to whatever degree of
harshness that you want. A little dark back in
there, it'll look like, there, little indentations,
and rocks, and stones, and all kinds of happy little
things that live in the, way back in the background. Add the least little touch
of bright red to that. Just to give it a little
pinkish flavor here and there. Something about like so. Now, back to my little small round brush. Little more of the green on it. Let's add a few little bushes
that live right up in here. Like so. Just tap it, and they're
just coming right over here. They just, they're just hanging
all over just like that. There, some little growers
growing right out in here. wherever you think they should be. (staccato brushing) There. See I want that to look very grassy. Like there's all kinds
of little ferns and stuff that live there. All right. And a little more of the brown. And we put a (whoops),
there's another little stone. But just work in layers, doing one little stone at a time. See, let's have this work in layers. Come back with our little round brush. Bring another one, but work in layers. That's most important. That way you can just
push the little stones right back into the bushes. OK, back to our little brown color. Tell you what, this would
be a beautiful place to have a little path. We have to, have to have a
way of getting back in there. So we'll just do
something about like that. (scratching) And I'm really really pushing firmly. (scraping) There. I don't, so you can hear, probably, How firmly I'm pushing there. (scratching) Don't know exactly where this is gonna go. And we don't care at this point, whatever. Whatever. Now then. We'll use a big round
brush, what the heck. We got the big ones and medium size, and little ones here, all kinds. Actually, there's only two sizes. OK, maybe in our world, we
need to close a little path in. Maybe we'll have some happy little bushes that live right here. And you can use this brush
sidewards or up and down, depends on the effect that you want. You want to make it look like there's little things hanging
over, use it sidewards. You wanna make it
upstanding, use it like that. Just up to you. If you don't like either
one, you can change and use a different brush. There. All we're doing is
putting in a little dark, so our light will show. OK. That's a little dark area in there. Now then let's take a
little of that color we had, gonna add a little yellow ochre to it. So I got yellow ochre, brown,
white, little touch of red. All those nice little colors. And very lightly, barely, barely touching. Just begin, (rasping) there. See that? Now we got a way to slip back in there. Little bunny rabbit coming right in there. Go back in there and hide. Or maybe he wants to go
back and see his brother, lives back around the corner. There. His brother's name's Jim. I met him one time. No, that's my brother's name, I'm sorry. All right, here we go. OK. Something about like that,
that makes a nice little path. Then we can begin adding
all kinds of little bushes and grassy things. Maybe I'll finish up this
little side right here. See there. Want that little path just to sorta look like it's going way
back in the distance. There. All kinds of little things. Work in layers, though. Work in layers. Now, little bit more
black into the yellows. Now then, let's take this
nice little green color there. There we go. Grab some sap green. I got sap green up here. That'll change the flavor again. Just wanna change the flavor continually. They're all green, but
each different green just is a little different. And in the woods you have all
different colors of green. There. So don't be afraid to have a lot of greens even though they're close together. They'll look different when
you finish the painting. OK, maybe right there, tell you what. I'm intentionally gonna
leave that dark right there, cause that'll help,
you'll see, you'll see. It'll help set everything off. There we go, like this big tree up here. I'm gonna leave it dark. There we go. (staccato brushing) Just layer after layer after layer, but darker and darker
down here toward the base. Down toward the base it
gets darker and darker. (staccato brushing) There's a whole clump of bushes there now. We're not even sure anymore
how many bushes live there. There we go. Put a few little things. Good. Just decided I need a
little dew right there. I'm gonna take the old liner brush, find a little bit of
brown, little bit of white, make a light brown. Light brown color, very thin. Very thin. Let's go up in here. Here and there, gonna put the indication of a little stick and a little twig. There. There'd be some sticks
showing through all this, all this many little
bushes and things in here. There'll be a few little sticks. We need those. And it also helps create
that illusion of depth and distance in your painting. There. OK. (tapping) Now, where's our little path going here? Take some more of that brownish color, let's keep it going all over here. Maybe I'll add a little of that lavender that we had left over. And have it go somewhere like that. And back to our little highlight color. Rub a little of that here and there. (scraping) There we go. We don't know where this path goes. It just goes on around the corner, maybe. On around the corner. Tell you what. This one's a little dirty,
but we'll use it anyway. Grab an old two-inch brush. It doesn't matter if it
has a little color on it. Be right back, get a little of that black so I can mix some green. Now then, maybe, let's have some fun. Maybe, maybe there's a little
bush that's right here. See the difference now, in
the way these little bushes look between the big brush
and the little round brushes? And it makes it look like there's all kinds of different
things in your world. Shoot, maybe, tell you what, maybe there's a little grassy bank that comes right down like that, right on down. And it goes right on up here somewhere, I don't know. Very soft, but we need nothing underneath. We have the color that was on the canvas,
that grayish color. And it's just mixing with all kinds of. I wanna put a whole bunch of this in here. You know while I'm doing this? I just sorta put together a couple little segments of film with some
of my little creatures on it. I wanna share this here with you. This was my little squirrel
when he was just a baby. And that's holding there. Isn't he just the cutest little thing? And then he gets a
little older pretty soon, and this is what they look like, there. All right, they're cute. This is Peapod, do you remember
Peapod the pocket squirrel? Now you know why we call
him a pocket squirrel. He's just the cutest little thing. And by the time you get to
see this, he'll be free. He'll be long gone. Look at that. That's one of them that
I've raised and released, and you see how far he went
right out in my backyard. And he thinks foraging
for food is running up the old man's leg, and that's, this is what it looks like to him. When he runs up and finds a peanut. But he's so cute, that's
what it looks like. But aren't they the most
precious little things? As I say, I've raised
them since they were just tiny little babies. But I got a letter a few days ago from someone who thought we were condoning making pets out of these creatures. And I really don't. All of these creatures we
turn loose back to the wild. I've worked with several
of the rehab ladies around the country. Here in Muncie, I worked with
Diana Shaffer, the bird lady. And in Orlando I worked with
several fantastic people, like Carmen Shaw and Ann Young, she's the bird lady in Orlando. And I just think these are super people that are doing a job
that needs to be done. And there's somebody in your area that does this too, chances are. And they need your help. If you have time, stop
by and give them a hand, and you'll find it so rewarding. Shoot, I go over to Ann
Young's house whenever I have a few minutes, she just
lives a little ways from me. I sit around, feed the birds. Cause she raises thousands
of birds every year and releases them. I just put a little brown here. I got talking, now I'm making
a little brown and white. Make a little bank here. But I like to go over, set with her. She teaches me about the birds. And we feed them, and you love them. They just, you really will,
I'll pre-warn you though, It's addictive, and you
will fall in love with them. But it's worth it. It's worth it. Just lay a little grassy
area right along here. I talk too much sometimes. I get on my little kicks with the animals, and off I go. There we are. OK. See I just wanted to make a
little bank here and there. Tell you what, we can take
a little of that dark color. Maybe there's just a big hole right there. So just that dark purplish color. Wanna make like a big recessed area. Place where some of my little creatures can go and hide at night. Now I'll put a little grass
right over the top of it. See, now they have a
little place they can sneak back in there and hide. There. Something like so. Now then, up here. Let's take the big round brush. And we'll just tap in a few basic shapes. Most of it's done in the black, and we don't need much up
here, just a few basic shapes. There we go. Once again, see areas like
this I wanna leave in there. Wanna leave in there. Just let the black gesso show through. There's a big oak tree. Take a liner brush. Oh, we'll use a little brown,
a little white, whatever. Doesn't much matter. Gonna cover most of it up. This is where, if you
got an old wiggly hand, it really pays off. I want an old tree trunk
that looks like it's got some character to it. (Bob makes a chuckling noise) There. Few little things here and there. We'll use our, we'll use a
little half-size round brush that's already got that color on it. Little bit of black,
yellow, little sap green. Mix them together. And let's just come right up in here. We'll put the indication of all kinds of little leaves on here. There we go. There, brighten it up a little so we can see it a little better. There. I have a tendency to paint
paintings that are quite subdued and quiet, so
sometimes I have to brighten them up a little so they
show up a little better on television. But when you're doing yours at home, you decide what color you want. How bright, or how
subdued that you want it. It's up to you. Up to you. There we go. As we travel around there, used to travel around and teach,
something I did for years. I learned that everybody
has their own idea of what nature looks like, and the way they want to paint it. I don't do a great deal
of teaching anymore, we have a lot of fantastic
teachers now that travel around. I'm getting too old. We got some nice young
fellows like Dana, Steve, they go around and teach. I take life easier. When you get older you have to. There we go. Few little bushes and
stuff right along in here. There. Just drop them in wherever. And let me take, let me take, take a little light color, and I'll put a little touch
of paint thinner with it. And a little bit of dark color, and put some paint thinner
with it so it's quite thin. They're both quite thin. And take my liner brush, go
through the dark color first. Then just pull one side of
it through the light color. I'm sorry. Slipped away, on you. And I just make the indication, maybe just a tree that lives right there. There he is. There he comes. Something about like that. Now we'll put a few little limbs on him. This is maybe an old dead
tree who lives out here. There we go. Maybe we'll even give
him a friend right there. There. OK, something like that, that gives you an idea. This is a fantastic little
painting I hope you'll try. It'll really pay you great
dividends and you'll enjoy it. Little something around his foots. Shoot, I think this one's
about ready for a signature. Let's take a little paint thinner, little bit of red, let's
just sign this one. Call it finished. As I say, I really hope
you've enjoyed this. Give it a try, maybe
you'll send me a photograph of your painting, I'd love to see it. From all of us here, let
me wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (gentle guitar music)
