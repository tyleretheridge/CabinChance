- Welcome back. So very glad you could join us today. You know in past shows, I've
asked you to drop me a line and tell me what you
wanna see on these shows. One of the things that
everyone has dropped me a line and tell me they want to see was someone doing portraits. So I brought a young lady
all the way from California to show you one of the most fantastic ways of doing portraits you've ever seen. And I'd like to welcome today Fern Sirois Fern, glad to have you with us. - Thank you, Bob. I'm gonna sneak right off the
set here, let Fern have it and I'll see you at the end of the show. - Let's begin by talking
about what to paint a portrait on. It's usually a smooth surface. And I've chosen a masonite board. I've prepared it with gesso
and I've worked up a sketch and transferred it on with a
transfer paper called graphite, then I sealed it and I've
buttered it up with my medium, meaning I've painted the medium on it. And the medium is Damar varnish, linseed oil, and turpentine. I'm going to use
an-inch-and-a-half sash brush. Let's go to the palette and
I'll mix up the first color. The first color that I'm
going to use is burnt sienna, Indian yellow, and cadmium red light because today we're going to paint a little baby Indian. Okay, now, with this great big brush, just paint all the way across the face. And because the paints that
I'm using are really very thin and the medium's already in the board, the paint comes off in a
very transparent manner so that you can see the
drawing right through. You'll never lose your drawing this way. And you get a lovely skin tone. Okay, this is a nice color to
also use in the background. So I'm going to handle
the background with this and I'm just going to let
the brush dance to and fro over the board. See how the painting just glides on? This is really such an easy way to get a quick portrait without a lot of effort. Now this can be smooth down, but at first it's going
to look a little streaky. But that's all right, it
gives it a little character to have some brush work in there. And so we're gonna get a nice impression. I'm going to vignette, and that means to just cameo
the portrait and the rest of the painting will be
very vague and sort of soft and diffused in the background. That's good because the
center of interest is really the little face. So we don't wanna confuse
anyone by putting too much in the background with a portrait. Now, I darken the corners and I picked up a little burnt umber. Okay, if you're getting streaks that go in one particular direction, the way to handle that if you
want it to be nice and smooth, is to brush against the grain brushing the opposite direction and that would smooth it out. Okay, we've got a background going here. And it doesn't take long
at all to really develop an interesting background. You can get all sorts of
subtleties in your brushwork here just by changing the direction
and brushing to and fro making basket weaves strokes
in and out, crisscrossing them. The main thing is to keep it interesting. Don't let it become monotonous. You don't wanna starburst
around your face. Now, this color is very
good for the costume color which will be a buckskin. So I'm just cleaning out my brush on it. And you notice, it seems to
get lighter as you come in towards the face and that
will help set the face off. And I wanna keep this color
really out of the hair as much as possible because
there's Indian yellow in it and when I go to paint that
hair black, Indian yellow and black or Payne's
grey will make a green. So it's a good idea to
keep those colors separated in painting. Well, we're almost finished
with the background. Now, wasn't that easy? Of course, that entire area
can really be softened up with a nice little blending brush which I call a bunny brush. It's really soft, soft hair. It's almost like rabbit hair. And a lot of painters
use this for blending all sorts of things, but particularly this
is really good on faces. So I'm gonna blend down all
the brushstrokes that might show up in my little face. And I'm going to get to work
on the details of the face. Now, the first additional
color that I'm going to use on the face will be cadmium red light. And let's move to the
palette and I'll show you how I load my brush. And dipping a short sable flat hair, about a number 18, and I'm gonna wipe it off on the palette so that I have a rather dry brush. I don't want gobs of
color on the brush hair because they're gonna be too thick. This needs to be a little
on the transparent side so I'm going to stroke
it in onto the painting about midway along the
cheek from the temple to the mouth. I load my brush again. And I'll do the other cheek. Okay, and while I'm painting the cheek, I'll paint the lips because
the lips will be approximately the same color. And since I have some
red on my brush already, I may as well develop
some of the headband. I always like to paint as
many places that call for the same color at one time as possible. I think that that helps
the painting to come up like a negative and develop
pretty much at the same time. I'm looking for another area
that I might paint red here. And perhaps a little bead
work down here to match his headband. This is going to be a little Indian boy. We'll call him Little One Feather. Okay, the next color that I'm
going to use will be white. I'm going to develop the
highlights and I'm just going to load my brush with a pure white. And I'm gonna paint it right
on to the surface of the face. You have to be careful
about overloading the brush which is something that can happen. In this particular instance
I got a little more paint than I actually wanted
so I'm dipping my brush into the paint and using it
like an inkwell to spread it elsewhere on the face. And right now I'm just
painting the highlights approximately where they're going to go and then I'm going to blend them. And I have a really interesting
technique for blending. I think that you'll
really gonna like that. You see how as I strike the lights, they pick up the color from underneath. And as long as I have
some white on the brush I may as well highlight other areas, for instance, the lip. And maybe a little highlight on the chin. All right, I'm going to
let that set for a minute and then I'll show you
my blending technique. But I think this is a good
time to let the paint rest and I'm going to show
you how to paint eyes. Eyes are really very easy and so our faces, if you
know how to paint them. I'll clean my brush. And I'm going to prepare to do the eyes and I'm going to use a little liner brush, a number one or a number
two is a good size for details such as eyes. I'm going to mix up. I'm going to the palette
now and I'm going to mix up some burnt umber and some ivory black. Now, I want to make sure that
the brush is not overloaded so I'm rolling the brush
and I'm wiping it off on the palette before I begin to paint. Now, if you've got your
drawing on there just the way you want it there shouldn't be any problem in painting the eyes. But you can make a few
adjustments as you paint. And the technique in painting the eye is that you, especially when
working with children is you wanna paint the top
eyelid first on both eyes. So I'm gonna paint the top eyelid and I'm using little, quick, short strokes rather than one even line. This way, it'll resemble eyelashes. Little short strokes. And remember that eyes are
really the important part of the painting to most people. Most people look into
the eyes of a portrait, they wanna see a lot in there. So this is an important
part of the painting and you wanna make it just as lovely as you possibly can. So take your time with the eyes. Okay, we've got the top eyelid painted, that's the rim of the eyelid. Now, I wanna paint the pupil. So I'm going to paint the pupil and I've loaded up my brush
with the same color that I use for the eyelid liner or the lashes. I'm gonna paint the entire
pupil in a solid mix of ivory black and burnt umber. Nice and easy. Can you see those eyes begin to appear? Now, baby's eyes are really a little wider and usually larger than adult eyes compared to the rest of the face. Now, these eyes need a little sparkle, need to be livened up so I'm
going to add some sparkle. I'm gonna dip brush into
some pure cadmium red light. Now combined with the dark
that I've painted in there, it should make those eyes
sparkle beautifully and give, and pick up some of the
reflected light from the skin and clothing. And here's a little bit
of painter's grammar. You use a comma on the right
and a period on the left or a comma on the left
and a period on the right depending on the light source. And usually the comma, the
period that is is opposite the light source so, the light source here is
coming from the right. So I'm gonna paint the comma on the right, dipping my brush again, and the period on the left. And a comma on the right, this is for the left eye, and a period on the left. Now, you may need to make some adjustment in the pupil area after
you've added your accents. So you can go back and readjust that, make sure it's
round if you've accidentally squared it up. And of course, you know what comes next. That will be the white of the eye so I'm going to take up a clean brush here and paint the white of the eye. Just loading it up with white paint again, only this time, it's
going to be a lot thinner so that I'm sure to pick
up some of the under color. Okay, this is a little curving stroke. Here is a comma, here's a comma and a little more paint there. See how it's picking up the under color. That's the most important
because the whites of the eye should really be very
compatible to the skin tone. They should have some of
the skin tone in them. I need to roll my brush
a little bit and have just a touch too much paint. Okay, now we're ready
for the lower eyelid. I'm going back to my palette
and I'm picking up that little liner brush and I'm mixing
up the same color that I used before that's burnt
umber and ivory black, wiping my brush off on the palette. And now, ready to paint the lower eyelid. It should be in comparison
to the upper eyelid, thinner and lighter. Remember, thinner and lighter. Okay, a little more touch
to the upper eyelid there. And since I have my brush
all loaded and ready to go, I think I'll paint eyebrows. Okay, eyebrows are done
a lot like eyelashes, little, quick, short strokes and lifting up at the end of each stroke and it's a flick of the wrist. I'll flick of the wrist. And if they don't match,
it really doesn't matter because most people do not
have matching eyebrows anyway. So you're never going to
paint exactly the same arch from the left as you get from the right. Don't worry about it. Okay, what do you
suppose would be the last and most important detail in the eyes? That's right, it's the highlight. So load up a little brush,
a pointed brush soft sable with white and get a nice
little blob of paint on the end and don't even try to touch
the surface of the canvass or the board, just touch paint-to-paint and dot. And if you pick up a little
bit of the under color, clean the tip of the brush
again and dip it again so it's nice, fresh paint and dot. Okay, it's time to start blending
on some of the highlights on the face. And I have a soft little
blender brush here that I like to use. It's good for small places. And I have another bunny brush
that's good for big places so I'm gonna try some of
the larger areas first. And here's the technique. You pull the highlight out from the edge and blend it over the
curve of the face following the curve of the cheek
and down into the the red that you painted for the rose of the face. See what a lovely soft blend
of color you get there. Little apple cheeks. Now I seem to gave a
little extra paint here. So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to push that back up and clean my brush as I go. It's a perfect example of
what happens when you have a little too much white there. Of course, I did that deliberately
so that you would know what to do in case of an emergency. And now, I'm going to blend along the base of the lower eyelid using a smaller brush. And out from the top of the highlight. Now, the idea is that
you run to try to keep as much of the painted highlight
unblended in the center as possible so that it
stays fresh and clean. Because you have wet paint under there, it's easy to muddy it
up if you over blend it so the idea is a light touch. Don't overblend it. Okay, blending on my lip, blending on my little chin. Now, about now you really
ought to be able to see a little face emerging. Can you see that face coming
out of the board there? I'm not so close. I really can't see that
but I'm sure you can. I'm gonna add a little touch
more red here on the lips. All right, it's time to
begin to work on the shadows. We've spent a lot of time
really on the lights. Let's work on the shadows. A burnt sienna, using the
brush that I had loaded for the eyebrows and
eyes, will work just fine. So you don't really need
to clean your brush here. And a little burnt sienna, draw a line along the nostril wing. And I'll redefine the philtrum there. That's a little soup strainer. And I'm going to really define
the opening of the mouth here and make a little shadow at
the each end of the mouth opening to create a little
bit of a smile or a little happy expression. We want a happy little Indian. This is a happy painting
and a happy little Indian. And up along the upper eyelid. Okay, now, so important when
painting very young faces and babies that you be sure
not to overwork the darks and not give them too many shadows because it can age the baby. So I'm going to define the lower jaw now. And it's time to blend
that in a little bit and we'll put the hair
on and we'll soon have a little face here. Okay, a little soft blender brush. This is called a mop
sometimes when you use it just for blending and
it's a little round brush. Some painters like to call it a mop. All right, I'm going to move along here and start painting the hair. I'm going to the palette
and I'm going to mix up burnt umber and ivory black. And I'm using a great
big ochre-round brush. Okay, from the center out and
along the shape of the head. We wanna follow the form of the head. Okay? Give him some little
hair hanging down by his face and ear. And a few little wispies sticking out from the headband. And while we're up here
let's paint a feather. In and down, in and down along the chisel of the brush,
in and down, in and down. Okay, and I'm going to paint
a little vein in the feather. Okay, that's out little Indian boy. He's coming right out here. And, of course, we have
to finish up his headband and give him a necklace. And we'll just keep this very vignetted. Okay, a little blue ornament. And a few blue beads. Perhaps a little white to show where the costume comes in. A little stroke of white here will show the edge of a neck of a little buckskin. This is really a little baby
so he has a very short neck. Little ornamentation on his rosette there on the little
amulet that hangs down. And here we have a little Indian, painted with ease, no effort, very little mixing and a whole lot of fun. I hope that you enjoyed that. - Fern we'd like to
thank you very, very much for being here with us today, On behalf of all of us here, we'd like to wish each and everyone of you happy painting, God bless, hope to see you next week. Bye, bye now. (calm music)
