- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today cause today I thought we'd do just a fantastic little winter scene. It's very simple and I
think you'll enjoy it. Let's start out and have 'em
run all the colors across the screen that you need
to paint along with me. While they're doing that let me show you what I've got done up here. Have our standard, old
pre-stretched canvas up here and I use an 18 by 24
inch but you use whatever size is convenient for you. We've covered the entire
canvas with a thin, even coat of liquid
white and liquid clear. I have mixed them together so there's a little bit of each. I want a little transparence up here. I wanna have a little
glow in this guy, I think, and for that, I put a little bit of the liquid clear with a white. So let's do that. Let's start out today with, we'll use the ol' two inch brush and a very small amount
of the yellow ochre. Just a little. Kay, let's go up in here. Now we have to make our first
major decision right here. We're gonna have a
little glow in this guy. Where's he gonna live? Maybe in our world, it'll
live right about there. That's basically all we have to do, is just sort of draw a little
oblong cirlcle like so. Wherever you want it. We'll just let it sort of blend outward. But there's not much color on the canvas, very little color. We're gonna come back
and we're gonna add white in there to make it even brighter. But right now we're just
applying a little color. I'm gonna take a very small amount of dark sienna, very small amount, and go right back into that yellow ochre. So it's a little bit darker
but not much, just a little. Be right back, there, dark
sienna and yellow ochre. We go up in here and right around that first little layer of color, we'll add that. Something like so. Same thing again. We'll come over here. Just however. Get a little bit more of
color on the brush here. Same color. Dark sienna, yellow ochre mixed together. `But notice we're starting
out here and working back. So the lightest area is in
here because in the meantime it's mixed with the liquid white. It has become lighter
and lighter in value. That happens automatically for ya. This is the lazy man's way of painting. There. Now then. I'm gonna take a little of phthalo blue, same old dirty brush, phthalo blue, alizarin crimson and we'll
begin making a lavender color. And even a little bit of
that dark sienna still in it. There, let's go up in here now. We'll just begin putting this on here and it'll make sort of
a coal grayish color. There. We'll just fill the canvas
up with it, what the heck. We don't care. Anything we don't like, we'll turn it into a happy
little tree or something. Cause as you know, we don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents. And very quickly, when
you're painting this, you learn to work with
anything that happens. Same color we used on the other side. We're just laying a
little color around that. Something like so. Okay, wash the old brush. And we wash our brushes
with odorless paint-thinner. Shake off the excess, (chuckles) and just
cover everybody around. That's the fun part. Now we'll just blend this out. If you're cleaning
brushes like this at home, I might recommend that you get a little brush-beater rack to put in the bottom of the waste paper basket or something. It will certainly go a long way, as far as preserving your happy home. Cause if you do this
procedure in your living room your spouse is probably gonna ask you to find some place else to dwell. A little brush-beater rack
is only a couple of bucks and you drop it in the trashcan. It'll save your home, and your marriage, and certainly worth the investment. There. Okay, now we can smooth it out. As we mentioned earlier, we want a nice bright spot right here
in the center of this. So I'm gonna take titanium white. Just a little titanium white. Come right up in here with that pure white and
just begin working outward. Start in the lightest area
and work always outward. Always outward. This will make like a glow in the sky. Very bright and it'll show up even more when we get darker colors around it. Looks nice already. There, now very lightly, three hairs and some air. Just gently blend the entire sky. It's all we're looking for. And sometimes it's fun to
put a little sun in there. You can take a little white on your finger and just make a little circle like so. And it usually looks a
little better if it's round. Those square suns seem to
bother a lot of people. I don't understand that but they do. There we go. That'll give us indication
of just a little sun up here in the sky. Tell you what. Let's have some real fun here. I'm gonna take some blue, alizarin crimson, proportionately much more crimson than blue, cause the blue is many,
many times stronger. And a little bit of that
same dark sienna in there. Same basic color we used in the sky. Just mixin' up a little
larger batch of it here. Now then, maybe in our world there's some nice trees that live back
here in the background. Let's just do it and see what happens. Lets just see what happens. That's the beauty of painting this way because we use no
patterns and no tracings. We learn very quickly to
just let things happen. That's when you experience the joy of freedom and creativity. You're not just tracing
something that we've done and following along and
filling in the blocks here. You actually learn creativity. There. That's where it's fun. That's when it's fun. Think about a big old
tree that lives right here and maybe just sorta looks
out over all of this. Think about these things in your mind. You paint mental pictures and
then you put them on canvas. Quite frequently I'm
asked how much I practice before I do one of these shows on TV. Normally, I don't do a lot of practice. I think about the painting
in advanced, mentally, and I paint a basic scene
that I'm thinking about over and over in my mind. Then when you come here
to do it, it's easy. It's like athletes practice
if they're gonna do a big jump or something,
they'll practice that mentally over and over and over. It's the same here. Just think about what you want to paint. Just let your mind go. There. Anything that you believe
you can do, you can do. If you believe strong enough
and you're willing to practice, you can do it. There, just layer after layer here. All kinds of little things
that live back in here. Wherever you want 'em. Kay, let's have something
on the other side. Shoot, we don't want it left out. This side'll get jealous if
we don't put something here. I'll tell you what, yeah maybe there's a happy little tree
that lives right there. Right there. With just using the corner of the brush, and that easy, you can build trees. There. And by making this color a little darker, it'll look like it's closer to you. See, already it's
beginning to look layered. And intentionally, we've
left these light areas here because we want the sun to shine through. When you're doing yours, don't kill all these. This will excite people
when you're doing it. And of course I know nobodys interested in selling paintings, but if you're out there selling paintings,
these little extras, that's what'll bring that happy buck home. Let's take a liner brush, some paint thinner, and we want to thin this down 'til it's as thin as ink or water. In fact, you can see it running
right there on the palate. See there, it's very thin. Turn the brush as you pull
it back off the palate. Turn it so it comes to a very sharp point. Let's go up here. Make some big decisions. There's got to be tree trunks, sticks, limbs, and all those things in here. Take the brush and just
begin putting them in. Just all kinds of things. Wherever you think they should live. Maybe you don't see the entire tree, maybe there's something in the front here. There. Some little doers that live out in here. Wherever, maybe you can
see a few little things there and here and here and there. Just sorta let your imagination go. Let your imagination go. There. Kay, maybe over in here. Another thing that I get a lot of letters, people are continually
writing and asking if we edit these shows. There is absolutely no
editing done to these shows. No editing, what you see is
exactly the way it took place. I know that there are other
shows that do but this is exactly the way it happened. If I did anything different without telling you, I'd
feel like I was cheating you. There. All right, even the
mistakes we leave on here. Kay, let's go on the other side here. This old tree here needs
a nice trunk on it, something to hold it up. We'll give it a wiggle here and there, so it's not just a straight trunk. It's got some character to it. We don't want one of them that just looks like a telephone pole somebody stuck up there with leaves on it. There. If you have trouble
with your paint flowing, it only means that you
don't have it thin enough. If you painted with me before,
you know our golden rule is, "A thin paint will
stick to a thick paint." But you can't reverse that and in this technique it doesn't work well. Let's put some nice
little highlights in here. I'm gonna take a little
bit of titanium white. Little bit of the cad yellow, not much, just a small amount. Little touch of alizarin crimson. Maybe even a little yellow
ochre and dark sienna but there's a multitude of colors here. It's not one flat, dead ol' color. I want a lot of things happening in this little pile of color. Push the brush, give it a little push. That loads color right out
on the tip of the bristles. Now then, we can go up in here and just using that little corner, you can begin putting all
kinds of little shapes. You can do this with a one inch brush. Let me get a little more color going here. You can do it with a one inch brush or two inch brush, it doesn't matter. Just whatevers convenient. I like the two inch brush cause it seems to work a little
better for me personally. Put a little Indian yellow in there too. Oh, that's what I'm looking for. That's nice. There we are. Begin thinking about
shape and form in here. don't just hit it random. Don't hit it random. Tell you what, you know, in the last series I
showed a couple little baby squirrels, they were so small and they looked like little drowned rats. We got so many calls about them. I'm gonna show you what
they look like today. These little devils are about grown and they're almost ready to be released. This is one of my little friends here. He's settin' on my settee, eating a little cherry tomato. They are the most
gorgeous little creatures and I have so much fun with them. Hope you enjoy seeing those as much as I enjoy showin' them to ya. But they really are precious. There. I have one little squirrel that the veterinarian has told me that
it probably has epilepsy. So it has to live in the house with me and we give it medication,
the whole nine yards, just like it was a little
puppy or somethin'. It sort of has freerun of the house. But he just runs around and plays. Actually, it's a she. Maybe in one of the other
shows in this series, I'll bring some footage in and show you what she looks like too cause
she's a cute little devil. There we are. I'm just laying in some
indications here and there. Nice highlights on these trees. Think where light would strike here. Put the little bright ones in there. Let that light zing through. Just let your imagination go. Use just the corner of the brush though. Maybe even down in here
we can see a little bit. Just a little. Now then, let me get a
little more color here and let's go to this one on the other side and give him a little highlight or two. Just a little highlight or two. There. Little bit right in there. Let's see, you wanna leave
some dark areas in the tree so it's deep, otherwise
there won't be any depth in the tree if you cover up
all those nice dark areas. Save 'em, they're your good friend. They really will make
your painting special. Down in here maybe there's a little something goin' on in there. Little bit more of that Indian yellow. We can come right there, there we are. See that little bush? He lives there, you knew that. Another one. Just as many or as few
little bushes as you want, if you don't have a lot of paint. You can actually see the
trunk right through there and to me that's sorta neat, I like that. That's sorta special. There we go. See, and here's another one. But work in the layers, doing the one that you think is farthest away and always working forward, forward. Leaving them dark areas in between. Once again, that's what
makes your painting special. I wanna get the least little
touch of alizarin crimson. I want one that has a little
more pink, right there. Little warm spot right down where the suns shinin' through there. But in yours, you decide where you think all these little rascals
should live and drop 'em in. If you notice, some of them here I have done nothing to,
I've left them dark. That looks like ones that
are back there in shadow. Sneaky. Let's take (chuckles), pure titanium white on the two inch brush
and we said this was a winter scene so we need a
little snow in it maybe. Maybe our snow starts right here. Take the brush, touch, and just let it go. Let it go wherever you want it to go. See there? If it picks up some of
this color, that's a plus. Don't get upset about it, enjoy it. Enjoy it, let it happen. That's what makes it beautiful because it looks like shadows in there. But, applying snow with a two inch brush is one of the easiest things
in this whole technique. One of the easiest and it works so well. We'll put a little bush
that hangs right out here on the snow and see what happens, it makes it look like
there's a plane behind there. It creates that illusion
of depth and distance in your painting again. So then we'll grab a little
touch of that on the bottom, pull it across, and now you can see a little
tiny highlight right there. Just enough to separate,
that's what we're looking for. Now, let's get crazy. If you've painted with me before, you know I always like to do these wild, crazy things sometimes in the paintings. We'll take some blue,
some crimson, same color, just gonna mix more of it. We'll have some dark sienna. I'm gonna put some Van
Dyke brown in there too. Shoot, let's darken it down a little bit. Oh, that's nice. Okay, let me grab another brush. Maybe we'll do some, oh I don't know, let's have some fun. Let's do some trees. I'll start with a fan
brush with a lot of color and let's make some
trunks with a fan brush cause it'll make nice, sharp edges. Maybe some of these tunks
will show through in this one. There. We'll have a little tree there. Maybe there's a big tree that lives there. All you're doin' is just tappin'. I like to sorta tap downwards so it makes these little fuzzy things on the side. To me, Evergreens usually have little fuzzies on the side. They're not real straight. They got a little rough bark on 'em. Okay, we'll have another one going off. What the heck, it's your world, to do whatever you want. There we are, now then. I'm gonna grab an oval
brush, I like those. The oval brush makes nice trees that the limbs sort of hang
down like they're tired and sometimes under the weight of snow or just old age, a tree
gets tired and sorta hangs a little bit like me. This oval brush does that very well. Load a lot of color and let's go right up in here. We start by just taking
just the side, touching, and begin thinking about
shape and form here. There we go, shape and form. See, automatically though, this brush makes those nice hangy-downs. There. Just ol' hangy-down limbs. There they are. As I say, these are fun to make. In this series I think I'm gonna use this oval brush several times, show you some different things you can do with it. I like it. It's easy to distinguish,
it has black handle, where our other brushes
have white handles. That's the reason we done this, so it's easy to tell. Let's do this one here. Here's one that lives
way up here in the sky. Way up here, it goes
right on off the canvas. What the heck. We'll just let it live
wherever it wants to. There. Gotta give this old tree some arms. Reach out here and grab some sunlight. There we go, there's one right out there. If you have trouble going over the snow, we're not having any trouble today, but sometimes you do if you have a lot of snow back there and you have trouble making that paint stick. Add a little bit of paint
thinner to your brush and then go through the paint. It'll thin the paint and allow it to stick right over that solid white. For example, if you wanted it to and were having trouble but don't do that unless you absolutely have to. We want to keep this paint as thick as we possibly, possibly can, so we can put thinner
colors over the top of 'em. I'm gonna leave a little bit of the trunk showin' right there. It's sorta naked there,
doesn't have any leaves on it. Bad year. Maybe on this tree was a, maybe a big ol' bear came
by and stepped on it. Hurt him, yeah. But he did okay, he's all right now. If you make up little stories like that your paintings are much happier. As you've heard us say
over and over in this show, if painting does nothing else
it should make you happy. It should teach you to see
nature through different eyes and make you appreciate
some of God's creations. I think painting does that
for everybody who tries it. I'll take a little white, little tiny amount of the dark sienna, and I'm just gonna touch,
sorta give a little pull here. Maybe this ol' tree here, maybe it's dead. So we'll just see a little
white zingin' through there. Just here and there though, don't want a lot of trunk showin'. Just enough, there. Now then, I have several oval brushes going, so let's take another one and we'll dip it into the liquid clear cause I wanna thin the
color that's going on there. Grab a little titanium white, a little bit of cad yellow, yellow ochre, and some of that red color. Same colors we've used before. Little Indian yellow too, that's good. Let's get a little roll
of paint right on the edge of that brush there. Push it and create that little roll. Let's come in here and
let's make some trees that the lights just zingin'
through and it's having a good time out here. There they go. That's just with the liquid clear in it. The clear, all it does is
thin the color a little. Don't get carried away and
kill all the dark though. As we said before, that
dark is so important. It's your good friend. Now back in here I'm gonna add the least little touch
of phthalo blue to it, just to cool it down. There, just enough to
cool it down a little. It sort of gives it a greenish hue without really paint green cause we don't want green snow. It's the only thing
worse than yellow snow. Don't want to make any
snow-cream out of that. Of course I have a good
friend here that told me, he never noticed the difference. But he said he never could get any of his friends to eat any of his snow-cream. Little more of the color. We'll put a few little
highlights on this tree. We don't want it left
out but just drop 'em in. With this little oval brush it
almost happens automatically and once you try it you'll
understand what I'm saying. It's sorta hard to explain
but because of the shape it almost happens automatically. Darker, darker down here toward the base. Let's take our brush that
has the titanium white on it. I wanna grab the bottom
of this and pull it. I wanna intentionally pick up
a little of this dark color cause that's gonna end up
being my shadows in here. That's gonna be my shadows. There. Now then, maybe fan brush,
we'll use the ol' fan brush. We'll just go in here and pop in a few little bushes and
stuff that live right around the bottom of all of these. Just a few little things. Now with a clean fan
brush, has to be clean. You can grab that and pull it. It's also a super way to make little sand-dunes in seascapes,
same identical way. You can create all kinds of little things. Kay, let's see. Let's go back here, take a
little bit of our darker color. Not too dark though. Just come right along in here. Just pop in a few little indication of a bush or
two that lives down here. Then we go back to our lighter
color, a little yellow, white, little crimson, yellow ochre, Indian yellow, all the little colors
that we've been using. Same thing. Just pop in some highlights in all these little bushes. But that easy. With the corner of the two inch brush you can just do fantastic little things. Change the flavor a
little bit here and there. So it don't all look just the same. Kay, back to our brush
with the titanium white. We can grab this and pull it again. Each time you do this
it creates another plane or another level in your painting. It really makes it special. Tell you what (chuckles). You know me. I like them big trees, so let's do one. Let's go into Van Dyke
brown and dark sienna. Just mix them on the brush. Yeah, I think we oughta do it right there. Just drop one in, just brown. Maybe we'll give him an arm, make it a big ol' tree. And it sets out here and it just watches this beautiful little scene all by itself. Take a little of the paint
thinner on the liner brush and come back in here
and put the indication of some little limbs and sticks and twigs, and all those things that live on there. Just like so. Shoot, I think with that we 'bout have a finished painting. I think I'll put one
more little limb there. We'll call this one done. Hope you've enjoyed this painting. It's very easy and bring a lot
of good things to your heart. From all of us here, happy painting, and God bless my friend. (pleasant music)
