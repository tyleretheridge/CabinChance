hi welcome back certainly glad you could join me today because today is a very very special day to me and I'm glad that you're here to share it with me this marks the 200th joy of paintings show today and it's does nice things to my heart to think that we have made this many shows and that you've kept us on the air this long and I tell you what since this is such a special show I'd like to dedicate it to a very special lady Annette Kowalski Annette has been with me since we started the joy of painting she's worked in every show and her and I traveled for a lot of years teaching and making all of this possible so Annette I hope you enjoy this one tell you what let's start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that come on up here let me show you what I've already done thought we'd do a special painting today so I've taken a piece of contact paper and I've cut two ovals out of it today son-of-a-gun looks like two big eyes there maybe it's that little owl we had on one of the earlier shows then I've covered this with liquid white on both sides so it's all slick it's ready to go so let's get started tell you what let's take the old 2 inch brush we'll go right into a small amount small amount of the Indian yellow just tap a little into the bristles okay let's go right up here maybe right along in here we'll just put a little bit yellow just a tiny bit right over here this is how you make a giant cartoon figure okay now I'm going to add a least little touch of the yellow ocher leaves little touch I will go right above that and just want to put a little gold and hue in the sky here just to make it nice and pretty and the same thing over here on this side just back and forth there we are okay now I'm going to watch the old brush and as you know we wash our brushes with odorless thinner shake off the excess and cover everybody in the studio and that's what makes it fun just enjoy now when you're doing this at home I strongly suggest you get a brush beater rack or something and put it on the bottom of waste paper basket because you'll change the decor of your living room in a heartbeat little phthalo blue let's go right up here just bring this blue right down almost to that yellow right down like that over on the other side same thing and let's have a little water in this shoot I like water we'll take a little phthalo blue get a little phthalo green just mix them on the brush what the heck all right let's go up here maybe our water is going to live right along in here somewhere just wherever you want it make a decision drop it in this is your world here so you can do anything that you want anything that you want there we are very lightly go across okay little more that they low green tail Oh blue mixture and we'll do the other side this is like painting two scenes at once only we're going to let the scene just continue right through there we are very lightly go across okay and then we can wash the old brush again I just like to watch brushes there shake it off just beat the devil out of now then I want to blend this together nice clean dry brush just blend it together right there really where they touch there we go over to the other side and the same thing again just blend them together all there is to it and maybe sometimes you like to have a little little stringy cloud now let's take a little touch of the midnight black just a very small amount the depression blue on there on the brush okay maybe there's a little happy cloud and he just sort of floats right across here like this maybe comes right over into this site see let him extend all the way through and everybody knows that the painting continues then very lightly just blend just blend Sollers to it wash your old brush off again there we are let's have some fun with some cloud today we'll grab an old fan brush here maybe for clouds we'll take some alizarin crimson a little touch of the phthalo blue in it maybe even a little black touch of white I'll be right back there we go make a nice lavender color I want that lavender color because when it touches the yellow it won't turn bright green it'll it'll turn more of a brownish color we just load up the old fan brush here both sides a lot of color just really rake it through there and you have to make a decision now where does the clouds live in your world I think there's a happy little cloud lives right here there's just the corner of the brush and just sort of scrub it in there maybe he's got a little friend lives right there there we go and maybe these clouds they come right on through what there they are just wherever you want them clouds are very free they just float around and have a good time all day so that's the way to paint them that's the way to painting good clean dry brush and all I'm doing here is blending a little to just remove excess paint there we go we're going to come back and put some happy little things on those clouds and little highlights and if you get all this excess paint removed then it makes it next step much much easier they have a go yeah then I have several fan brushes going so I'll just grab another one take some titanium white be right back right back here grab a little a bright red just a little just put a little pinkish glue in these clouds make them sing disco pair hey everybody needs to sing in the sunshine there just come right along here and right on the top just just put some little highlights up here there we are see they just let them dance right along the top of the cloud there okay there we go see all we're doing is just just putting some frosting up here these are the good parts but you have to lay your base color in there first just like baking a cake got to put all the ingredients in the pan before you can do it and we're doing the same thing here same exact thing there we are and you just sort of decide where all kinds of little things live and drop them in drop them in once again with our good clean dry brush use just the top corner of the brush and blend the bottom of the highlight just the bottom just blend it just wind it up a little bit okay other cloud and go right over here like so just continue to blend there we are now we're going to fluff these clouds I beat the brush only to remove the excess paint that I've picked up it's easier than cleaning the entire brush look at there that easy we have some beautiful beautiful little clouds just floating around lift them just blend them very very effective and nice way to make some happy little clouds okay tell you what maybe we'll have a let's have a little Mountain back here for that I'll use some black Prussian blue van back Brown some crimson just mainly some nice dark colors very very dark pull your paint out flat go down with a knife cut across get a small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife let's go right up here now you got to make another decision where does your mountain live in our world there it is is right there maybe there's a bump there where you want wherever there and all we're looking for is a nice edge on the top we could care less what's happening down down in here we don't care about that let's go with the other side and let these mountains continue maybe they come right on through there like so let's put them right on up in a cloud shoot that's a big mountain over here it lives up here now sky has fun okay scrape off all the excess paint just pull it right off there get get tough with it this is where you take out all your frustrations and hostilities and that's where to do it because you don't have to make anybody else mad shoot you can do you can remove all those negative feelings pull them out they're large brush all I'm doing is blending that color out just pull it and blend it this is also an excellent way of laying out highlights and shadows in your mountain now this is continually mixing with that liquid white that's on the canvas and you get all of these different tonal values just automatically automatically alright let's take some we just use some titanium white we're gonna pull it out very flat cut across and once again our little roll of paint looks like there's a little touch of that bright red in there - that's alright that'll just be very pretty on there look like a little Sun zinging retic awesome almond there we are no pressure no pressure at all just lay the knife no wait no pressure there and in your world you figure out how your little mountains are just drop them in wherever you want and whatever shape may be where you live the mountains are different maybe there are no mountains you can leave the mountains out of this and it's still a beautiful painting still nice let's go if the other side of this rascal a little roll of paint there we are but no pressure I know you get tired of hearing that but it's so important that's probably one of the most often asked questions that I receive in the mail is why am I having trouble making a paint break and bounce like you do the only problem is normally one or two things and normally it's too much pressure sometimes it's because we use a paint that's too thin if the paint's not very firm and very dry it'll just you become a button mixer mixing up a little phthalo blue and white here will make shadow out of that once again our little rule to paint right on the edge of the knife okay give it a touch and a pull just follow your Mountain zoom right on down that's fantastic you can make a mountain that easy you can do it you can do anything any other thing all you have to do number one is believe that you can if you believe you can do it you're halfway home then all you need to do is just a little practice become familiar with the equipment and you can do it let's put some shadows over on this side too there we are a little bit right in here like so there okay maybe a little touch just follow the angles in your mountain there and you can come back and you can add all different planes in here if you want them or just anything anything as you know if you paid with me before we don't make mistakes here we have happy accidents you learn to work with anything it happens any old thing it happens to now then with clean dry two-inch brush I'm going to tap I like the angles in the mountain I want to create that illusion of mist back here so lift upward now this takes out the little tap marks brings everything together smoothes it out let's go over here it's most important that you follow those angles are most most important if you don't you're going to just chop the bottom your mountain off okay it'll look like somebody take a big razor blade didn't run zipped it off in the way it went and it's much nicer if you can sort of look through the mist and see it down okay maybe we can bring a little projection out here just putting a little that shadow color on the brush and create a whole other plane in the mountain whatever just let your imagination go here we just want to show you how to do it what you do is up to you completely and totally up to you there may be over here they'll just have a little saying comes out here to wherever you want however many you want tell you what we just use the same old brush I got a little bit lavender color left that was just a mixture of alizarin crimson and phthalo blue and little touch of white in it okay let's go right up here maybe let's go right here maybe it's a little footy Hill Foothill is right there just take the corner of the brush or you can use a one-inch brush or fan brush whatever there we go see just put in just a happy little background thing they're far away okay maybe it just continues sort of seaward set and continue it there it is there it is you knew it was there all the time there this is also a nice way to make hills and mountains from Oh North Carolina and all that area they have some beautiful beautiful country there and you could just leave the mountain out and just put several rows of these little foothills looking things that I'm using here and it makes beautiful beautiful little mountains and we use a clean brush I want to tap the base of this and I'm tapping it very firmly I want to create that illusion of mist let's go over here we have tap this one really get in there and tap on it and they lift slightly upward just like so now back to our same old brush and sometimes it's fun to put several layers of these in and it helps helps increase that illusion of distance in your painting and you know me I like I like paintings that have a lot of distance and depth in them and if you're interested in selling paintings whoo that's what sells that's what I'm bringing that happy buck home we'll have some reflections here so I'll just pull some that color right into the water okay and lightly across instant reflections instant reflections maybe this goes right here maybe it comes over here and drops right down there we'll play a little watch here watch you will create a little mist under this one Nana back to my other brush maybe there's another when it comes down here and comes right in front but you need that misty area that is so vital if you're gonna make this look like it's separate if you don't have that misty area in there they'll just they'll just go right together you will tap in a little bit of mist here now then we need some reflections on this side to take a little that color pull it straight down it's important that these reflections come straight down and go right across just like so okay tell you what let's do let's go up here get a little dark sienna white I want that darker I'll add some Van Dyke Brown to it oh that's nice that's nice cut off a little tiny tiny roll of paint man just gonna go back in here just sort of scrub in indication of a little land and I don't want a lot of detail back there's too far away don't want it yet right along there tell you what let's do I want to show you something else change my mind change my mind maybe there's a little there look at there sometimes you just see things that it looks so fantastic I want to I want to add something right here watch here one of the most fantastic things about this paintings technique is right in the middle of the stream as they say you can change your mind I have decided maybe we'll have one more area back here let's do that it'll help create that illusion of distance there we are yeah then Amy find a fan brush let's go right in to get a little black pride into some CAD yellow a little yellow ocher Lily Indian yellow just mix them on the brush a little touch the bright red many many colors on the brush hills go up here and let's let's begin putting some color back here should let's make this a little more interesting hmm that's nice that's nice I thought that would be better there we go I'm just pushing up we were the fan brush make all those little grassy areas that are we black you maybe this one comes right out there it is a whole different plane now let's take a little let's take a little bit of the liquid light pull it out flat and cut across okay now that we'll just have us a little water line back here see how you can make it by adding that in there it creates another plane and it's more distance in your painting a lot more distance so I mentioned at the beginning of the show this is the 200th joy of painting show and it just I am just I'm proud as a new pop over there and Annette and I travel for many years all across the country and we talk literally thousands of people the joy of painting and we made just hundreds and hundreds of beautiful friends and I hope they're watching and they share in this because they made it possible so many of you have made it possible let's go back into our dark color old fan brush maybe way back here there's a little tiny trees so you can set a little tree back here there he is I'll give my little friend just the corner of the brush just a quarter maybe here and there you can just see the indication of some little things that are too far away to really make out what they are okay this may be one over here so it's not left out like so there what'm trees are fun let me grab my knife just mix up some more paint some black blue Van Dyck Brown lizard crimson throw a little phthalo green in there too what the heck whatever you get long as it's dark back to the old fan brush just wipe it right through here maybe yep butter goes my Mountain that I like so well that's all right we know he's back here so if anybody ever asked you you can tell them there's a fantastic mount goes right behind this tree let's make a beautiful little tree right there nice evergreen maybe yep right there all right there another one shoot we don't want them left down there's another one right there maybe when this one was little it gets stepped on he's got a little crook eating and we just put some little little landmasses right out here we can bring some of that right down and all I'm doing is playing some color there take another large brush grab it give it a little boundary pull doop doop go across there we are yeah we can take we can take some black somes some CAD yellow just mix it together on the brush go right up here and let's put some highlights right out here on these little trees just some nice little highlights don't overdo keep these trees pretty dark pretty dark okay I'm gonna take a one inch brush dip it into a little bit of liquid white then go right through a little CAD yellow a little SAP green all the different yellows here let's go right up here and here we're gonna have beautiful little Bush lives out here little yellow ocher there we are okay just drop that right in you can reflect a little let down in here if you want to give it the most gentle pull there very nice very nice a little bit of Van Dyck Brown put it in a little land to take a little white little dark sienna that's a nice color beautiful color cut off that little roll of paint just put the indication out here of a little highlight on that little touch of the liquid white then we have a little water line right under there clean knife scrape in a few little sticks and twigs and little happy things that are happening should that's looking nice it's really coming along nice little indication here and there of a stick of twig now then tell you what fun time let's bring the camera right up I'm gonna pull a contact paper off and let you see what's happened this is the moment of truth look at that now we have two great big eyes looking at us now watch what we can do watch what we can do just go back to the fan brush that dark color in the middle here in our world there's going to live weather sure is right now a beautiful big tree right here I love this idea this idea was sent to me by a fantastic man he's one of our teachers he travels all over the country and teaches people that this method of painting he lives in British Columbia superfriend and his name is nat hojae and that comes up with all kinds of ideas well he makes some of the wildest things with his contact paper you've ever seen okay maybe tell you what maybe there's another tree lives there let's just say there's one there maybe we'll have another one there don't get crazy okay there he is just put him trunks up here and we can come back and here you could care less what's happening we'll separate that with highlights are you worried about are the nice tops all right here we go right there use just the corner of the brush as you work down the tree apply more and more pressure more and more pressure and this big and up here there is there is boy he's really hanging out here eagle tree there yes tell you why tell you one I like these old crickety trees there's another one right about there wherever you are there we go shoot listen it's too slow let's get the big brush pull it through that dark colored one direction load a lot of paint into the bristles that's important that you load a lot of paint and we can just give it a push decide where we want our land to live out here and we'll come right along here maybe like that there's little thing wherever or wherever go back to some of this dark sand on white put us an indication here and there of a happy little tree trunk just wherever you think they should live there we go however many okay yeah we can take a little touch of the liquid white go into some of our colors and let's begin putting in a beautiful little Bush or two here and there there he is there he is little yellow ocher here and there we can drop one in see there just wherever you want maybe tell you one tell you maybe there's a little land out here we'll just take a little brown around and what I'm finishing this up the old clock on the wall tells me that about time to go for the day I hope you've enjoyed this so super little painting
