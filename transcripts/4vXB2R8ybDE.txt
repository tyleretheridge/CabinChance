hi welcome back I'm certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting with me super tell you what us haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that let me tell you what I've done I've got mold standard 18 by 24 inch canvas up here I've covered it with a thin even coat of the liquid white and it's all ready to go so drag out your paints or pull up years each year either one and let's have some fun together let's start out today with some Prussian blue good strong dark blue just a little bit of it let me say that again a little bit of it because it is very strong on the two-inch brush let's go right up here let's just drop in a happy little sky let's just do it let's just do a fun painting today start at the very top of the canvas working all the way across making little X's little crisscross strokes little crisscross strokes there we go and by working across like it and then begin working downward your paint is mixing with the liquid white that's already on the canvas and automatically your color will get lighter and lighter toward the horizon and that's exactly what we're looking for today let the paint work the canvas work should take life easy just let it go there we are very lightly go across the whole sky just take out the brush strokes and bring everything together and that quick hmm we got a quick little sky very simple and easy and now then add a little more that color into the brush wait we'll have a little water down here shoot I love water so maybe the water lives in our world oh I'm not sure where it's gonna be so let's just throw some blue in wherever we want water we all have it there if we don't want water it'll paint right over we're not committed at this point we can do anything that we want to do here any old thing okay very lightly we'll go across the entire canvas three hairs and some air yeah then let's wash your old brush we'll just grab him off and some odorless thinner give him a shake and just beat the devil out of it sometimes those brushes get away and they go soon clean the other side the room that's when you find out who your friends are take a little of that titanium white just pull it in one direction through the brush there get a lot of color on the brush ulis mix up let's make some pickled fluffy clouds that live up here in the sky tiny little circles tiniest little circles there we go and we're looking for a basic shape here don't just throw this on at random and and hope that a cloud will appear sort of plan out what it is you want to do there we go just basic cloud shapes and don't stay in one area and keep working it look here if you just stay here and keep working and working and working all you end up with is a big cotton ball now I got to get rid of that see but if you do one of those you do a cloud ectomy and you're in business again that's all it takes okay keep that brush moving let him dance in there no just let them play clouds are one of the freest things in nature we'll give him a friend right here big old friend there we are other side in just very basic little shape shoot whatever you want in there there when we were kids we used to look at clouds and see all kind of things and same thing happens in your paintings do clouds and you stand back a lot of times you'll see all kinds of things in there okay now we're just gonna use the top corner of the two-inch brush gently gently blend those clouds gently blend them just here they don't overwork them don't overwork them now we'll lift them give them a little fluff there we are and very lightly two hairs and some air just give them a little blend same thing over here so give you some nice practice with clouds there's a lot of fun to do and they're very very easy very easy beat the brush just to knock off excess paint so I don't have to clean it now we can lift these up make some pickle floaters out of them there we go that may be in our world shoot while we're doing class maybe there's another little cloud it lives in the front here when you can do these clouds and make just layer after layer but do the one that's farthest away first and work forward always working forward there we go maybe it comes right on over here we don't know we don't know today I'd like to do a let's do a big mountain I get a lot of requests from people wanting to do mountains that don't that don't have snow all over make dark mountains so maybe we'll try one of those today and if the painting develops out of it that's even better but I'm really interested in showing you how to do a mountain today so let's do that all right let's start with midnight black and we'll put a little band Dyke Brown into it a lot of color pull the paint out flat really put some pressure on it and go straight down cut across get our little roll of paint let's go up here now you have to you have to make a big decision real quick today where is your mountain gonna live maybe in our world there it is comes right down here wherever you want it you just drop the deal really push that pain in there maybe it goes over here comes down there and all we're looking for right now it's just a basic very basic shape it's all we're concerned with really pushing that paint in there this is just midnight black anybody like brown in it okay maybe this comes over and maybe there's a little bump there now when you do your painting you do it any way that you want to do it maybe your mountain has a totally different shape and that's fine painting should make you happy it does nothing else shouldn't make you happy and if it doesn't make you happy you're doing the wrong thing because it's fun and if you can do things all of your life that make you happy needless to say you're gonna be a happy person now then I'll just take this old big brush and very gently I'll grab some of this just pull it this is just pulling the paint down removes excess paint makes it even so you can add more colors on top of it that's all just let it blend right on down here toward the base okay well we have one huge mountain today what we said was going to a big mountain so what the heck got sorry that's all right wash the old brush off there we are there we are let's have some fun now it takes some Hawaii time you dark Sienna using the little life I got that little now hope the loop Van Dyke Brown over here but notice taking one pile of paint trucks and on one side and white Van Dyke Brown white here now maybe over in here what take some Van Dyke Brown little black I had a little depression blue to it I'm making several different colors a little more blue we'll use that maybe for a shadow color so I want it oh that's nice that's nice that's what we're looking for leave all these colors marble-top now let me wipe the old knife off I just wipe it on a paper towel now then let's go up here get our little roll of paint on the small knife and let's begin picking out some of these little highlights touch no pressure no pressure at all touch and just pull a little bit of the shadow color maybe right back in there no pressure though no pressure here and there we can go back with a little dark add some little little ridges and all kinds of beautiful little things that are happening sort of let your imagination go and whatever you want just all types of little things happen in here though but absolutely no pressure with a knife if you put pressure it's gonna look like you're ice to Kate and just barely barely touching pulling him down to our chat Oh color here and there touch pull down and there's always some dark shadow areas in there you can just drop them in blend some colors in well you just make some of the most ferocious mountains this is where the old mountain goat lives he hangs out up here and has a good time okay maybe over in here even some little things happening all right yeah then go right into some straight midnight black let's come right up here maybe there's a maybe there's a peak it lives right there goes maybe a we up here comes down through there wherever you want it just sort of think about all the things that live in this Robin should tell you what to human maybe maybe there's a glacier in there maybe there's some snow laying up there I'm taking a little depression blue and white icing it together very little blue well the roll of paint if you want to have a glacier maybe tell you one maybe he lives right along there make a decision drop you man just letting you know just let him lay in there and sleep there maybe it comes out here I don't know and you know when you when you buy your first tube of paint you get an artist license and that license says you can do anything that makes you happy so use that license it yours forever and ever okay back to her black maybe now we'll just have all kind of little things that live right along in here like so wherever we want them but maybe that comes there we don't know you don't know where shoot maybe some of that snow was laying down in here but it's just playing games here with contrast a lot of nice contrast going up maybe maybe this little snow there it is just think in these areas where there would be little areas that maybe the snow would fall in there and it didn't melt and beautiful things happen hmm and a little touch of bright red here about color should we get crazy little more in the dark Sienna but leave it marble so you have all these streaks happening cuz when you pick up that roll of paint those streaks are still in the paint they're still in there and we can come along in here just change its flavor a little bit put a little highlight here in there that little light play across there wherever you want to wherever you want it those shadow here and little shadow there there we go okay and then just all transit nice things happening it's more the dark over here there and begin playing some little shadow things gotta make those little noises CAD make those little noise middle of the color and here it plays right down through there it's let your imagination go it's fantastic I get so many letters from young people all across the country that are painting and painting has opened a whole new worlds to him and it's so wonderful to hear from from people my gosh I'm three or four or five years older parents write and tell me that children have taken an interest in it and they watched the show and they they paint in some areas I have friends that have started painting clubs especially in high school and in college and etc and they get together they paint together and they have they had some Bob Ross painting clubs and I was absolutely flattered to hear that absolutely flattered and they've sent me some photographs little roll of paint of some of the things that they're painting it's unreal it's unreal and young people have a better imagination than I do or they can they can paint some of the most beautiful things here we're just putting in little little doers wherever you want to maybe there's another stone here in the front so up here just sort of look around and see where you think stone should live in your world these are some rough mountains and if you take your time you can do some unbelievable of thing like this just take your time and work at it and play enjoy that's the name of the game it's enjoying really already enjoy what you do in life if you do then you'll do a good job and I certainly enjoy what I'm doing I spent half my life doing somebody else's thing and if you can if you can ever ever get a job doing the thing that you like to do best and it's wonderful I'm just taking a clean dry two inch brush I'm just happy just tapping I want to create a little mist down here at the base of this little mountain big mountain hair just a little mist then lift gently upward that takes out the tap marks brings it all together over here the follow these angles sometimes it's nice just to take the brush the same way in and tap in little grassy things that just grow right up in there and that's that works very well very well you just shoot maybe we can even do a little touch of it here you take a little green or yellow ochre or something it doesn't matter tap a little color in there I just want to show you how I don't really I'm not really gonna do much of it but you can see you just follow the angles and go right on up and you can you can have grass growing all down here at the foot to your mountain and that's very pretty and very effective OOP King that's enough of that wash the old brush just to show you how to do that area maybe back here let's have some fun shoot we take some blacks pression blue Van Dyke Brown there's some crimson maybe a little SAP green whatever you got just mix it up long as it's dark okay let me wipe my knife off here we just wiped this knife on old paper towel okay fine find a fan brush maybe back here in the back there's some maybe there's some little tree he's lived back here just drop some of those in and this is one of the easiest ways to make the indication of a lot of little trees far away just take the brush and tap it downward and see it's all there is to it you can make a whole forest in a second here there we go and we're just looking for basic very basic shapes these are too far away to have much detail now sometimes here's a problem that happens you know make them like this and it begins looking like a fence if that should happen all you do is just add a few more trees just fill that in they get too far apart look like a fence you can either add a few a few more trees or put wire on it either way whatever if you want a fence then that's what you're to have sometimes maybe you want one there hope you get to see the show that last show that we did it or so it had Hank Snow in it that's kind of against a heck of a painter I really enjoyed my time with him we went to Nashville net and I didn't painted with Hank and couple other people from the Grand Ole Opry a couple of days he's a lovely lovely man hope he sings on the Grand Ole Opry for another 50 years okay Gavin I want to create the illusion down here maybe some little little trunks on off street sign just take a little white on the fan brush grab it lift upward make it look like a little trunks that are far far away if you happen to put one in there that's too light just rub it a little bit it'll go away okay yeah then maybe back here just use that same old color I'm just gonna tap in what'll end up being put a land area back there little little Lin remember we wouldn't worried about where our lake was gonna be or a little pond because we decided we could just chop off whatever we didn't want and now is the time to do that decide where your ponds gonna be grab pull straight down just pull straight down and this will this will be the reflection instant reflection is that easy I think of gently lightly across there yeah okay now then let's put some let's put some pretty things out there maybe this is fall and all the beautiful colors are beginning to happen shoot let's get over here and some red and Indian yellow make this one with a lot of red in it but when you do it you make it with any color that you want I'm just in a mood today to do some beautiful colors nice bright colors it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive I'm kind of think of it every day is a good day to be alive there we are just tap you chain maybe people come over on this side just drop in a few more little things now think about the lay of the land the games getting very important Oh beautiful red color there in Alaska we have a lot of mountains like this and in the fall the colors will change and you have all the oranges and yellows and red looks like it looks like a painter went crazy and his pallets built all over the all over the landscape I've never seen such things as Alaska has in the autumn the colors are absolutely spectacular a little bit here and there okay yeah let's take a little bit of n that ground let's just scrub a little dirt down here at the bottom just really scrub an idea there we go a little bit of the liquid white on the knife and with that let's just put a little water line in just to break it up there we go alright tell you what let's do maybe back here maybe there's some bigger evergreens we just take the fan brush go right into that color a lot of paint in the bristles let's go right up here maybe their lives in our world maybe there's an evergreen that was there just sort of look around and you're painting because each painting is different each painting is different just put them in and go with them wherever you want wherever let's put one on the other side what the heck right there there he is yes yeah then maybe down in here there's some tell you what let's do let's put some yep right along here let's just close this little pond yep if we had another 10 minutes on the show there wouldn't be a pond at all we just keep taking a little more and a little more away from it there and now you have just a skinny little pond out there just enough to be very pretty okay we can come back with our nice highlight colors or fall colors the ochres and yellows and bright red let's just begin putting in all kinds of little little grassy things here oh there's more that red I like that pretty there we go just decide where you want to drop them in that's all maybe tell you what this let's have a little bit of fun maybe down here in the foreground take some liquid white go into some we'll use some CAD yellow right over here and grab a little the bright red make a firecracker here let's go right up here maybe their lives happy little Bush right along here little more on there in just put all kinds a little look at that little bush right here in front maybe woo there's a nice red one Jack Frost has hit him hard really something there we go just some little things right down here in the foreground and and our world maybe their lives a nice evergreen tree right there you use just the corner of the fan brush work back and forth back and forth there shoot it's fun listen let's have one over here there he goes there back and forth head lady in class one time she called these Z trees like sorrow that might be an excellent analogy just back and forth I get a lot of letters asking if I still teach classes and I really don't teach many classes anymore we have a lot of young people are good and tough they can go out here and do it I got lazy I want to stay at home a little trunk here from brown and white but we have a lot of teachers that travel around and teach including my son Steve that little rascal well he's a heck of a painter little yellow little green put a little highlight on these trees and I think we'll be about done come right along there a little more SAP green that's a little too bright oh that's nicer yeah I call Steve a little devil he's six foot five it's not so little he calls me shorty little little highlight on these little trees shoot we gotta finish painting really hope you've enjoyed this one it's a lot of fun that mountain will give you a little challenge but it'll teach you how to use all the equipment and to make some fantastic effects so until next time from all of us here happy painting and god bless [Music] you
