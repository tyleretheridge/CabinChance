hi welcome back I'm glad you could join me again today today I thought we'd do something is a little bit different I really believe you're going to enjoy this one I've taken 18 by 24 canvas and we have it vertical as up and down and on the top here I've covered it with liquid clear and then on the base of the canvas I've completely covered it with liquid black and sort of blended it together and put a little touch of Prussian blue right in here I think we'll take that and we'll do something that's unique and you're really going to you're going to have a good time today let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and let's go on up here and get started let's start with the old two inch brush today I'm going to go into a small amount of the Prussian blue just a very small amount because we have liquid clear on top of the canvas it doesn't take much color just a small amount let's go right up here and then we'll just very gently begin blending a little let in that'll mix with a liquid clear and it dilutes the colors you work downward so automatically your sky gets lighter and value as you work downward see there now when you're putting this liquid clear on your canvas use it there very little I can't stress that enough probably the biggest mistake made with it is putting too much on the canvas that the canvas gets too wet and that paint it just sort of slips and slides takes them very very little if you get you one bottle of it'll probably last Chinna rest to your life maybe longer you can pass it down to to your grandchildren but see it makes a very delicate soft sky if we had liquid white under there it would dilute the color this way with the liquid clear that remains transparent you don't pick up the opaque color underneath and it creates some very unusual and very pleasant effects all right let's put a happy little cloud in the sky today take the fan brush it will go into titanium white now the titanium white is a very opaque color which means you can't see through it so we load the brush full of paint let's go right up here decide basically where you want your little cloud to live and let's just go in here we take the corner of the brush and let's just push you in a happy little cloud just really push it in I want this little cloud to be very rough it's just sort of bouncing around the sky but you can see how it's picking up that blue that's underneath and you get all kinds of effects say I want very soft little tops on this one so just sort of scrub it in and work in layers say now here we'll come with another one and you can create the illusion of depth in your clouds just by working in different layers like so I think so maybe I'll tell you like this have one right there and in your world you put clouds wherever you think they should be just let them float around the hip front there we go maybe a little more there wherever now to get a good clean dry two inch brush and then just very lightly I won't just blend out the base of some of these but very little don't overwork your cloud don't overwork it just rub it a little bit on the base little circular strokes and get away from it negative all there now that very lightning very lightning we can fluff that up this is two hairs and some air you're just barely touching barely touching then we blend it all out and this will give a completely different effect than if you have the liquid white underneath as this begins to dry a little bit you're going to get the blue soaking through here and it'll make very nice little edges on all these little clouds try it you'll really enjoy this okay and that quick we have a happy little sky I'm going to take going to take one we don't take we use some Prussian blue Persian blue and black blue and black for a black and blue a little bit of white so we got blue black and white I'm going to add the least little touch of alizarin crimson in it that leaves little touch if you get too much you're going to have purple and I don't don't want purple I like that that's a nice color cut across ten years little roll of paint on tonight maybe way back here in the distance it lives lives lives a happy little mountain and he's far far away scrape off you can hear how hard I'm going to scroll here that just really get in to scrape off every bit of paint that you can get off every bit that color is in the canvas you're not going to get it all off now grab it with a big brush and blend it just blend it blend it blend it just let it so disappear will whack the brush a couple times blend it we want it to just be floating up here in the clouds literally just just floating around this guy having a good time salt the lighter in value make this the further away to look okay now then today shoot let's get crazy now let's get crazy guns we're going to check out your nerves today see if you're brave and we'll go right in to the titanium white I'm a load a tremendous amount of paint in the brush today the paid salesman's Intel get it your paint on the brush okay let's go up here I want a big glacier right up here so grab all your nerve but both hands go right in here decide where it's going to live soon drop it in drop it don't be afraid of it do it we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents and if yours doesn't come out looking exactly like this that means it's better it's better there see just lady like so and don't try to just copy we're really trying to teach a technique here and turn you loose on the world I know that don't look like a glacier yet but I hope in a minute it does to begin begin creating the lay of the line here or the lay of the glacier ISM is it point maybe maybe it comes around something like so I don't know we'll decide that later just have all kinds of things happening in here hey now I'm gonna go touch a little bit of the blue and I'm going to pull in this direction the little blue just a tiny little bit of blue Tiny's little bit blue see and it creates sort of a shadowy effect I don't go crazy this Prussian blue is oh my gosh it's strong one tube in Atlantic Ocean would absolutely change the color of the whole ocean it's that strong okay now comes the fun now comes the final let's take mostly black midnight black then put a little touch of blue in it if you want a little touch of anti Brown and if you want but mostly black get our little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife as usual there it is now then let's make some big decisions right in here we'll put some dark color see there right against that light boy that stands out maybe maybe right along in here lives there's a bump and it comes right on down we are gonna make one awesome mountain big too maybe right along here we just fell all this Sam see how easy ideas and we have beautiful the glacier later add up on top of that mountain looks like a lot of the mountains in my home in Alaska there we go all this color in there okay like so now down here down in here here I'm going to use some titanium white Prussian blue and some black I'm making a bluish color about like so cut off that little roll of pain again and I'm going to begin fading this out I wanted to get more into the bluish color down here pushing very hard just when I'm right now just trying to push that color right into the fabric right into the fabric like so okay I'm gonna change to the small knife it it works better these little bitty places okay here I'm taking some Prussian blue and white and once again even with a small knife we get that same little roll of paint let's go up here now I want to show a thickness so there's a shadow right here see so you create a little shadow but just adding a touch of blue and it makes it thick and we don't want that to be too straight so we can just take the knife and in here and just tap in all kinds of little ridges and bumps still following the basic lay of the land say here we'll have some here they go across wherever you want them to go it's up to you it's up to you up to you this is your Mountain so you do whatever you want then we can put a few little highlights here and there there few little highlights and keep this quite dark though you don't want to lose that beautiful dark value that you have here it gets too light to scrape it off put you some dark right back in there see this is the way you separate them right here bring them all apart put all those little things and individual things let that come right on down to wherever okay we find a clean brush here and here I'm just gonna tap this I want to create the illusion of mist here just tap it and it lifts gently upward let's see that brings all those together there we go follow the angles in your mountain though there like so can you beat the brush here West well take a loose pain out of it and dual-x though now let's go back to black and blue and brown mostly black still once again our little roll of paint every time I load the night nearly I love that little roll of paint and then let's go right up in here and maybe there's a happy little bump a crock big stone and he lives right there see in your world you decide how many rocks and bumps and stones live in here and put them in you can have as many or as few as you want there just drop them Rascals right in there and that helps also build that illusion of depth once again a little bit of the dark blue and white so we can indicate a shadow or two on there and I'm just barely touching and this is where you would separate the different stones yeah you can pull them apart there we go then let's let that come right on down like so and you can make as many or as few bumps as you want now I'm going to take a fan brush and I'm going to dip it into the liquid clear and I want to make a paint this quite thin here quite thin a little bit of blue into that not much just a touch just a touch I'm going to reach right in here and grab this and just pull bring snow right up to the base right up to the base see see how you can just bring that snow right up there in it and then just blend it out and then with a fan brush you can smooth all this out now with a liquid clear in there this will slide right over the top of that white without destroying and you can put all kinds of happy little things in there just basically wherever you want you can drop them in because this is your mountain and it right here I want to come right back in here maybe we'll have this look at there maybe it comes right around wherever this in my mind would be a little more shadow so I wanted to pick up some of that under color so I'm really pushing hard here really pushing hard I want to grab that and bring it all together and we can take take the old knife and just reach up in here put a few little things here in there have a few little doers that come right down just to break up them and not me and rush with a little liquid clear and white and you can add highlights wherever you want them you can also take and maybe there's little bumps maybe there's rocks under the ground that are that are covered with snow that you can indicate those just by doing that like so okay that was super let's have some fun now maybe there's some there's some trees and stuff in here maybe let's take I'll just use a brush it has a little touch a little touch of blue left on it get some SAP green and some yellow yellow ochre tap I don't want a great deal of paint on the brush just a little right now we're going to go right up here and maybe back in here there it is you knew it was there all the time banking here is just maybe a little grassy feel that lives right in there and all I'm doing is tapping a big thing to remember here is to follow the lay of the land you have to make a big decision here how does the land flow the angles in the ground that's that's your responsibility at this point to make that big decision when you have this kind of power and can create mountains and trees you have to make those kind of decisions and you can you can hmm okay tell you what let's do now let's put a happy little tree or two in here so let's go the old fan brush go right into this dark color we this is the same old dark cover that we've made the mountain out of load that fan brush full of paint a lot of paint see there can't score up here now we had to make some decisions I want some little evergreen trees you have to decide where they live maybe right there is a happy little evergreen sneeze just letting it drop out of your brush like so and there's some indications here I don't want to kill all this I'll let some of it show through so you can see behind this group of little trees there let that come right on down here's a nice one day that's a big one big strong evergreen just to use a corner of the brush pushing downward as you work down the tree push harder and harder for a murmuring Fuhrman just push that little rascal right Eddie brush there we go just like so that fantastic you can make a whole group of little trees that easy you can okay maybe maybe this one here let's turn him into a little bigger stronger tougher tree but you can still see some of that green through there makes it painting much much more interesting in there and you'll like it better when it's done by having these little things in there maybe here's a little baby tree right there okay let me go back and get the old two-inch brush tap it right into the green yellow curry Indian yellow and all we're doing is tapping just tap the brush just go right up here now want to continue with this bring it right on across now the more you tap this the soft it'll get you can tap it until it just off looks just like velvet and let's begin bringing this over make it curve see the create the lay of the land here with your brush if you really want to have some fun watch here ah - this will take a little touch of the Van Dyck Brown follow that same angle just fall it just follow it then we'll take a little Oh a little touch of the dark Cianna a little Van Dyck Brown a touch of white and just let it skin across the top just barely touch see that like that now back to our brush with a greens in it and bring it right over see like there's big grassy things hanging over you see some little stones and rocks projecting through there hmm that's sneaky and it's so pretty it is what will sell your painting or or make people just really just really happy with it let's have some more fun let me grab a fan brush go go into some liquid white and right into titanium white and you remember at the beginning of the show I mentioned to you that right down here I'd put a little bit of Prussian blue right on top of the liquid black now watch what happens let's say there's a happy little waterfall and he from right down here comes right over and goes just like so over now if you push real hard it's going to pick up that blue that's underneath and give that sort of a bluish tint and it hits right about there see corner of the brush push upward make all these little splashes for it it's just churning and splashing there's some foam lives down here and then it begins pulling out through here see how the Blues picking up that sneaky huh I thought you'd like that okay now I'm back to my knife grab some more that Bend egg Brown now I'm going to close this side of the little waterfall in go push it right back up come right down maybe there's some more rocks over here like so you have to make these decisions wherever this lives in your world that's where you put it once again same highlight color can you just barely barely let it touch just barely let it graze least least little amount of pressure no pressure absolutely no pressure back to our brush and watch here what you see there now because we're getting quite a build-up of paint on their head a little I end a little thinner to the paint I see it sticks better comes right off the brush much easier so if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little touch of paint thinner see how you can follow right down there but when you're adding is thinner and very very little very little and we can just bring this right I don't around looks like big grassy ferns and all those things that live around where there's a waterfall because it's very humid here waterfall that high there would be a tremendous amount of humidity so you'd have all the the almost tropical things probably grow in here see look at all that so simple and you can do it you really can do it t-take what over here let's go to this side maybe right here here yep here's another little thing it comes down let me grab my knife let's put some stones over this side maybe this one comes down ah they're kind of make these big decisions maybe the stone comes down right there wherever you want it wherever you want same thing put a little highlight on that stone shoot who knows maybe let's get crazy maybe there's another stone in there maybe just yep my world see a stone right there there's just stones everywhere in this painting maybe maybe on out here you make a big decision drop it in and go just go in just go in all right and then back to our color on the brush and we can be in tapping in all these things and just follow these angles come right on down just wherever you think there should be land that squared or to be wherever SAP green CAD yellow yellow ocher and you nail just vary these colors so they look good to you you can make all these soft little Hills you can have color just falling right over so it looks just like all these little grassy things here and just see them just working right over like at as many or as few as you want in your world and by brightening them you can change the plane see now that one stands out very distinct like so one of the questions of that I hear over and over and over is what do we do with all these paintings that we do on television most of these paintings are donated to PBS stations across the country they auction them often they make a happy buck with them so if you'd like to have one you know if touch with your PBS station because we do we give them to stations all over the country to help a mountain but they're fundraisers a little waterfall write their tune see how that just came right over maybe right here comes over all over that cat nests right on around wherever you want to go little splashes here let's just wander right on out you know you could get crazy you could even put maybe there's some little grassy things grown out here on that rock - who knows No let's have another Rock maybe there's a nice stone it lives right here in front of this there you can just make layer after layer after layer of these we don't want that one to do without so we'll a little bit of thinner on my brush here we can come right along here look at that put some nice little grassy things hanging all down on this rock that easy there easy little liquid white titanium white then we can come right in here clean up all this bottom here make it look like the water's flowing right on out we don't know where this goes it just goes on out of the painting somewhere tell you what let's do going back into my brush with a dark color on it and in my world I want to evergreen there's right here in this hill it's all you had to do take some dark color and drop him in see there he lives up here in the hill he watches this waterfall down here he's got a friend named Clyde there's a whole collide right there take it knife scratch in a little tree trunk here and there few little sticks and twigs and you have a completed painting I really hope you've enjoyed this one it's a little different using the liquid clear and the liquid black try it you will have fun from all of us here happy painting god bless see you next time Oh Oh you
