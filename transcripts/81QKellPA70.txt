- Welcome back, I'm glad
you could join me today. Today we're going to do something that's quite a bit different, it's a lot of of fun and you're going to have a good time doing it with me. So, I'll have 'em graphically
run all the colors across the screen that you
need to do this painting. And you'll start with the titanium white and go around in the same
order that I have on my pallet. And while they're doing that, let's go up to the canvas and get started. We'll take the fan brush today, and we'll go right into a titanium white. And just put some right on the brush, let's go up to the canvas. And today I want to do a scene like you're deep, deep,
out into the woods, and maybe there's a little light coming through all these background trees, and all, we just let things happen. A lot of times, like in
Oregon, California, et cetera you go into the deep woods
and you see scenes like this. So, let's have some fun. And we start off here with a fan brush, and let's just do this. I've already covered this canvas with a thin coat of
thalo blue and sap green. And I just mixed them on the brush and covered the canvas with 'em. And I just do this here and there, wherever, wherever, wherever. Just let it go, have fun. There, see? I know you're saying, well
he's done it this time. He has got number one mess going. Maybe, maybe, we'll see, we'll see. Just have fun. Just let these things
happen, here and there. These are always fun paintings. These black canvases,
holy, they're so much fun. And they're good canvases
to make you a happy buck, if you're interested in monetary gains. There, just here and there, wherever. And we'll take our large brush, and very gently we'll just
blend this out, smooth it out. And that's all there is to that part. And I'll wash the brush, we wash our brushes with
odorless paint thinner. Shake it off. (brush smacking) And beat the bristles dry. And I'm going to take another fan brush, I have several of them going here, and we'll mix up some color first. I want a black color, so
I'm going to use thalo green and alizarin crimson
in about equal amounts. Maybe a little more crimson
than green, tiniest bit more. Usually the thalo green is a little bit stronger than the crimson. Now when you're mixing color, pick it completely up off
the palate and turn it over. That way it all gets mixed. Otherwise, what's against the
palate when you're doing this won't get mixed if you don't
pick it up and turn it over. Most important though you want to get a nice even distribution,
nice mix of color. Alright, now let's have some fun. Let's put some trees that are way back in the background here. And we take fan brush,
load it full of paint, and let's go right up here. And already you can
begin seeing your areas where it looks like trees. So we'll just take a
little of this black color, and fill it in. Wherever, these are your trees so you put them where you want them. And every painting will
be different, everyone. There's one, there's one
there's one, let it go. Let it go, make them as thick
or as skinny as you want them. As many as you want. These are your woods, so
whatever you want in there. There, okay maybe, maybe. I see another one right
there, right there. And this is such a nice painting because it's very simple to do, it works, this one will
work on your first attempt. It's that easy. Now I've got most the paint off
the end of the bristles here and I want to put some
that are far, far away. So without adding more paint, I want this to be lighter,
they're farther away. More light's between this tree and you. So I want that one to be lighter. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
maybe he lives, there's one. Just let them go, put 'em in at random. Wherever you think they should be. Tell you what, that looks
like a natural place right there for a nice
tree, so we'll put one in. Now if you were real careful when you put your light color in here, you could probably leave these places and wouldn't have to
go back and paint them. But I'm not very careful most of the time. I just throw things in
and let them happen. Okay, maybe, maybe, maybe,
there's one right there. Just drop it in. It's that easy, that easy. Maybe, maybe there, there's
another one, I see it. I see it right there, don't you? Sometimes they're close together, sometimes they're far apart. Sometimes they grow in clumps. Just however makes them happy. Just however, there. Maybe there's a big one right here that you can only see half of. Maybe the other half's
off the canvas somewhere. And that's all we're doing, that's basically all
you need to do to put in all these little indications. Now, I'm gonna take
the script liner brush. This is a number two script liner. Put a little paint thinner in it, and go right into the same color. Turn the bristles, turn the brush. That brings it into a nice sharp point. Lets go up to the canvas. Now, I want to put some
indication here and there of some limbs that are hanging across. And we'll just put these in very lose, very free, let 'em go. This thin paint now, we'll stick
on top of the ticker paint. We'll use a very, very
dry firm paint underneath, and then we can put all these
little things on very easy. See there, make little limbs. Tell you what I'll do, this
looks like little bushes, but I wanna blend up a
little bit to soften 'em. Push them back a little farther before I put too many limbs over there. That'll push them back,
there's some right there. There, push them back, make
them farther away, that easy. Okay, now we'll go back, put in a few more of these little limbs here and there. And you can put in as many as you want. As many as you want, let
'em go, let 'em happen. Just think like a tree. That's like I remember my dad telling me when I was a kid, if I
wanted to catch a rabbit I stood behind a tree and
made a noise like a carrot. And when the rabbit came by, you grab him. Works pretty good, til
you trying to figure out what kind of noise a carrot makes. There. Needless to say I didn't
catch any rabbits. Okay, this would be a good place for a little rabbit to live. These beautiful deep woods,
nobody'd ever find him in here. I spent quite a bit of time in Oregon, and this really reminds me of
some of the scenes in Oregon. Oh, there's some beautiful, beautiful woods in Oregon
like no where else. California, in northern California, beautiful things happen, beautiful. There okay, now maybe, maybe, maybe don't want this
one to feel left out. We'll put a few limbs here now. Just want to show you how to do this, you can put as many as you want. Back in there a few. Just let 'em happen, let 'em happen. Already that should be giving
the impression of deep woods. Deep, deep woods. If you're paint will not stick, add a little more of your
paint thinner to your brush. Gotta have that thin paint to make it stick to the thick paint. Okay, now that will give us
a nice feeling of some woods. And maybe there's a, tell you what let's take, let's take a little bit of yellow. I'm using just this old dirty brush. Put a little green on it, little green, and just tap it, just tap, see that'll load it up. Now let's go up to the canvas here. Now we have to make some
decisions back here. Maybe, right in here. I use very little color. Color really stands out
more on a black canvas than it does on a white canvas,
so use very little color. And I want this to be
very soft, oh my goodness, just like a little clearing back here in the woods, little clearing. Very soft, beautiful little place. Be a nice place to go and sit, talk to the birds and the trees. I've added a little indian yellow, a little yellow ochre
or both to the brush. And just mix these on the brush. Mixing on the brush, when things happen. Let 'em happen. There, see you begin creating layers. Let's go right up here. Now we need some, the trees
wouldn't all stop back there. Some of 'em will be closer. So we need to make some that
are a little bit closer. We'll do that, cause we can do anything. We have artist license that says anything we wanna do, we can do. There we are, alright. Now let's go back to our fan brush, and I go right back into this black color. Right back into it. Okay, and let's pull a
few of these trees out, and bring 'em closer. Maybe like this one right here. See, by just extending it
right over the grassy areas then it comes forward, that easy. And we need the indication
there's a little foot, he'll, maybe we'll give
him a little foots like so. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
there lives a tree right here. You can put a new one in, doesn't matter. He comes down to there. Yes, he does, see there,
give him a little foots. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, yep, you're right, you were right there's another one. And you can put as many
trees in here as you want. Just let them happen. Okay good, maybe, I'll tell you what, let's bring this one a
little bit closer too. Shouldn't have a bunch
in this little closer. Now we wannna, I wanna make this look like there's a little bit of
light coming through there. So I'm a take a little
bit of permanent red, little thalo blue with
it, and a little white. Okay, that'll be our shadow color. Now, let's use, there we go. We'll go back, we'll
use some permanent red and less blue, just a
tiny bit of blue in this. It's the same color, only
one is to the reddish hue and one of them is to the blue hue. Same color, little more white. There, good. Alright, now watch, come right
down here on the palette. Watch right here, we're
gonna cut across that, and get small tiny, tiny
little roll of paint right out on the end of the knife. Okay, let's go up here. Now let's say today, maybe, maybe our lights coming from the left. And all I'm gonna do is pick out a tree and begin touching. Just touch, just touch where you think the light would hit. Now if the lights coming from the left you want the left side
of the tree to be bright and the other side to be cool. Okay, maybe, maybe, maybe
there's a little light striking this one right here. There we go, now if you
want it to get darker, if you just keep working on it, tapping, touching, and the black color underneath will come through and it'll make your color
darker automatically. You don't even have to worry about it. And that's the joy of painting. When you don't have to worry,
oh there was a good plug. So, a little more light
hitting right there. A little red, a little blue. Okay let's put a little bit
on this one, right here. There we go, just barely touch. And you just touch the canvas, the canvas will pull off what it wants and give you back what's left. You don't have to worry about it. Don't even have to worry about it. Little extra light right there. In my mind that's where the
sun's gonna come through and twing, hit right there. Now, into the shadow colors. This is the same color,
permanent red, thalo blue. But this is more to the
blueish hue, it's more blue. See that'll give it a
dark side, a shadow side. There. Okay, little bit on this one. Don't want him to feel left out or lonely. There we go. Isn't that a super, nice little way to make very effective trees. I knew you'd enjoy that one. That really, really and truly
is a beautiful way to be. Little bit right there. And it works, so simple, so easy. As I say, this is a fantastic
first painting to try. If you've never painted
a long with me before, this is a good one to try. And this is on a black canvas now. We prepare these black canvases
with a flat black acrylic. They're painted with a flat black acrylic, allowed to dry completely, and then we go back and
apply the color over them. In this case we applied
thalo blue, and sap green. This brush mixed all over the canvas, and you see what happens. Bring some of them limbs
right across the tree so they're not all on each side. Okay, that'll give you
enough practice on limbs, you'll know how to do them now. Okay, let's get up here and play. But you can see by
pulling those trees down how it creates depth. Okay, now we need to cover
up those little foots. And you can take a
little bit of black color on your brush if you want to put a little shadow behind these trees. See there, easy, easy. You can drop a little
shadow right behind 'em. That simple, okay now we
go back into our yellows. I got cadium yellow, indian
yellow, yellow ochre, and here and there a little
touch of permanent red. And let's just drop in these little soft, quiet grassy areas. Little sap green added
to that, dull it down. Don't want it to get too bright. Isn't that a super way to
make a lot of trees fast. Let's put some over here,
can't leave this side out. Now all I'm doing is touching the canvas, just tapping it very soft, very quiet. Darker, darker, darker as it
goes toward the foreground. You know, if you had a
beautiful place like this I'd wanna little house,
I'd wanna live back here because this is where
the bunny rabbit lives and you could sit here
and you could talk to him, and you could have all kind of fun. So let's put a little house back here. I'm gonna start out with
van dyke brown on the knife. Just get a little bit of paint, cut across get that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife. There you go, okay let's go up here. Maybe our little house lives right, right there, right there. We'll do the back eve, there we are. Now let's do the front
of the house, zoop, zoop. There we go. There we are, and we can
straighten out this edge. There is numerous ways to make houses, this is just one. And maybe in your world,
there is no house back here. I just want to show you also how to make a little house in the
woods if you want one. You may not want a house in your painting. And this is a beautiful
painting without a house. So if there's no house in your world, don't put one in your painting. Maybe he's like me, he ran out of room. We'll have to give him a shed, I like to make little sheds on the houses, little storage areas, or maybe
it's where his chicken lives. You know chickens need a house too. I'm gonna put a little shed right there. And bring it down. Okay, okay, now then
let's do some playing. I'll take some white, a
little bit of van dyke brown, little burnt umber into it. White, van dyke brown, little burnt umber. There, just mix it up. And this we're not gonna mix too much, we want this to be marbley. And we'll just cut across it. Now, here we go, barely, barely touching. Barely touching. Oh just barely touch, let it just gently, gently,
gently slide across there. You want that paint to
break, make it look old. And wanna take the same color, and add a little more white to it. Cause we said our light
was coming from the left, so the front of the cabin would be a little bit brighter than the side. Same color, with white added to it. See, now that stands out better. It's the same color,
just a different value. Maybe out here there's a, tell you what, I'm gonna add a small
amount of blue to that to cast it into a little shadow. Just a little bit right in here. Once, a little bit of color on that, that's gonna end up being a little shed. Okay, maybe, maybe, tell you what, maybe there's some little shingles. We'll take some permanent red, with a little van dyke brown, let's put a few little shingles here. Or just indications of shingles. Drop 'em in, drop 'em in,
just coming right across do it in layers so the top is covered by the bottom of the one above it. Just like we'd put real shingles on it. There, that's all there is to it. Now we need, let's put a little highlight just so it separates this. Just a little bit of
highlight right down the edge. Ain't that a cute little
cabin out there in the woods? I need a door, gotta have a door. Can't get in our cabin, a
door lives right there, doop. And around the door, we
need a little bit of light so the door stands out. There we go. Let's put a little bit of white on there, that'll make it stand out. Oh yeah, that's much better
against that dark canvas. Just a little indication,
maybe, maybe maybe, maybe there's a couple
of windows over here. There's one, there's one. Looks like two big eyes looking at you. I wanna take a little
bit of blue, put there, make it like there's a
little bit of light shining across the glass in the window. There's a little glass out here. Little straightening up. Give a little highlight around
the windows so it stands out. If you want more all you
gotta do is cut through this, make it look just like little boards. Your cabin so you do whatever you want. Okay, now we need, now
we need a little path. Let's get up to this cabin. So I get back into the
brown and the burnt umber, just sorta mix together. And, and, and right
here, right there comes a little path, and this little path just, just wanders wherever you want it. Let is wander, let it play. Van dyke brown, burnt umber. And let it get darker, darker, darker, we don't care where it goes. Now we can take a little brown and white, barely, barely touch, a
few little indications. It looks like there's a
little blue in it too. A little thalo blue, brown,
white, a little thalo blue. Barely touch. Darker, darker over here. Okay, now then. Let's go back to our two
and a half inch brush, little yellow, sap green, and, and, and, and, we
can come back in here, and play into all these
beautiful little grassy areas. Bring 'em right down to the
edge of this little path. Little dirt area, just let 'em go. Little bit yellow ochre, cadium yellow, indian yellow, just mix them on the brush. Let 'em go. Now we add a small, small
amount of permanent red to that, maybe just put a little
spot right in there. Right there. There, don't want too much of
that in there, just a little. Sap green, and the yellows mainly. Just let it go. There. This really is a fun painting, I think if you will do this one, this one will make you happy, it'll make your heart feel good. It'll really make you happy. And that's what painting's all about. Painting should make you happy. Should make you happy. Okay, let's go to the other side. Put a little bit right, look at that. See how easy, all I'm doing
is touching the canvas and sort of just barely bending down. Don't let the brush slide though, just tap it, don't let it slide on it. If it slides, it'll just make streaks and pretty soon you end up mixing mud. And you don't want to be mud mixers. Very soft, quiet. And if you get one that's too bright, or too distinct, all you have
to do is tap it a few times. It'll pickup the colors
underneath, and it'll go away. It'll just go to whatever
you want it to be. Very, very soft, very quiet. Maybe, tell you what I'll
go into a little sap green and yellow with a one
inch brush, I'll do that. I wanna keep this quite dark, quite dark. Okay, let's go up here. Maybe, maybe there's a
little bush here and there that just grows around
the edge of the house. There he is, there he is,
where ever you want it. See you can add these little
bushes and stuff in here. Maybe this guy didn't
cut his yard too well, and it's beginning to grow. Let's go right, put a
little one right there. A little lights hitting this one, I want it a little brighter, yeah. Very good, comes right down
in front of that big tree. Sap green, we'll put one way back in here. Don't want this one to be very bright. I want it to be far away, dark. Okay, we can drop a few of 'em, let 'em come right over the land area, that pushes the land
down into the painting. Sometimes when you do land or paths or little roads or something, you have the feeling that it's
floating above the painting. If that happens, bring some
of this and bring it over it. Let it come literally over part of it, and it'll push the path or the land right down into the painting. And it makes it fit so much better, and you'll be happier with it. Okay, I think we about got that. Might, might take and put
the tiniest bit of highlight right up here on the top of this roof. Just to make that little
shed stand out a little bit. And I think it just about
gives us a finished painting. I'm gonna sign this one, use
a little bit of thin oil. And when I use a thin oil
I usually use something like linseed oil or copal, whatever. Whatever, just thin oil. Now we can sign this one. I hope you've enjoyed it,
it's taught you a lot. I really do hope you try this one because you'll find it to
be a great deal of fun. And from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting. God bless. (relaxing music)
