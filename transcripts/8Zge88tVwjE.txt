(instrumental music) - Welcome back. So glad to see you again. Today I thought we'd do something that's mainly in browns
and maybe we'll do, maybe we'll do a scene
where like, you're standing on a cliff right here, looking
way off in the distance, and you can see all kind
of little beautiful things happening far, far away. So, I've already covered
the canvas with magic white in order to save a little time, and let's start off here. We're gonna take just a tiny,
tiny little bit of crimson, this is Alizarin crimson, put it on the big brush and really beat it into the bristles. This ensures a nice, even
distribution of color throughout the bristles. We'll come right down in
here and just very gently, making little X's, begin
putting in a little of the crimson here. Now, when you're doing this at home, don't use too much crimson, it will look like your sky is on fire. And we just want to put
a little pinkish glow, we don't want to set it on fire. There we go. Maybe we'll do a little bit
like back and forth, like so. OK, now I'm gonna go right into
a little bit of burnt umber, without washing the brush. I'll allow the crimson to
mix with the burnt umber and right above it, a little bit of the umber. There we are. And we'll blend all this
together in just a second. A little bit more of the umber, and maybe we'll come from
the outside inward here. And just put a little color down in the bottom of the canvas. Try to keep these lines pretty straight when you come across. This'll end up being a little
bit of water down here. There we go. Now, I'm gonna go right
into the Van Dyke brown. Still have not washed the brush. And right across the top here. A little bit of the Van Dyke brown. Just like so. Now, now we can finally wash the brush. Well, let's add a little bit
of the brown down here, too. Keep the color the same on top and bottom. Then we can wash the brush. Okay. Now we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner. and there's a screen in
the bottom of the can here. And you scrub the brush against the screen to remove the paint, and we shake off the excess thinner. (laughs) And then just
beat the devil out of it. Okay. Now we can take and
blend all this together. Clean, dry brush. Just bring it all together. And I'm still making the
little criss-cross strokes, little X strokes, whatever
you wanna call 'em There we go. They're very gently hypnotizing. And, now, let's take a little bit of the burnt umber, little bit of Van Dyke brown, and a little crimson in about equal parts. Just mix 'em all together. Maybe a touch more crimson. There. And now let's go right up in here and just put some happy
little clouds up in the sky. And I'm pushing very hard with the knife. Really push the paint into the canvas. And we're using very, very little paint. Very little paint. Maybe there's a little cloud that goes right off the canvas here. He just sort of wanders around in the sky. And maybe a little one right in here. Just wherever you think
there should be a cloud. Just drop it in. Now we'll take the large brush,
and following these angles, very carefully just blend across. Isn't that a super way
to make little clouds? Just little stringy clouds
out here in the sky. Okay. Now let's use the fan brush today and do something a little bit different. Same color as the clouds. This is just burnt umber, Van Dyke brown, a little bit of Alizarin crimson, and let's go right up
in here and just lay in a basic little mountain
shape with the fan brush. Very basic. Show you how to do very
simple little mountains today. These you'll love. And we just gently pull down a little bit. I want these mountains
to be far, far away. Far away. So we're not looking for
a lot of detail in 'em. There we go. Now with our large brush again, we're gonna grab this and pull downward. Just pull it downward. And very gently, we can
blend all this together. Want this mountain to be
very soft, very far away. And by using brushstrokes here,
you can give the impression that there's highlights
and shadows in the mountain without actually doing hardly a thing. Just change the brushstrokes
in a few places. Okay. That gives us the impression of a nice, soft little
mountain that's far, far away. Okay, let's play with
some little clouds here. We'll have some clouds that are floating right over the mountain. I'm gonna add a tiny bit of
magic white to titanium white. just to thin it down
a small, small amount, 'cause once again, a thin paint
will stick to a thick paint. So we're thinning the paint
down here just a little bit so we can make it stick
on this thicker paint. Let's go right up in here
and let's just start dropping some happy little clouds in here. Just the corner of the fan brush. Keep that brush moving, turn it. Little tiny circles. Maybe just floats right out like that. There we go. And at this point, the only
thing we're worried about is the nice top edge on these clouds. We could care less what's
happening underneath. Maybe, maybe, maybe, there it is. I knew there was one over
here, we just had to find it. Just let this one just sort of drip right across the mountain. And clouds are one of the
freest things in nature. They just sorta go where they please. Now, with a large brush, very gently we're gonna blend
out the bottom of the cloud. Very gently. Very gently. This paint is quite thin
so you don't have as much blending ability as you normally would. Then we'll hypnotize it. Gently. Just touching it. Don't want to destroy,
we just wanna soften it and blend it so it floats back here. And you can put as many
layers of these little clouds in here that you want. Maybe, maybe in your world, maybe there's another little
cloud that lives right here and just sort of floats around
the bottom of the mountain. You have to make these almighty decisions. Okay, then we'll gently blend
the bottom of this one now. And I'm just using the
corner of the large brush. Fluff it up a little bit and then very gently, very gently. Okay. I'll mix up some more color here. We'll take some more of the burnt umber, Van Dyke brown and crimson, put it all together. And then I'm gonna take
a little bit of white and just dilute some of it here. Maybe I want a tiny bit more
into the Van Dyke brown. So you just add a little bit more to it. There's what we're looking for. Nice color. Now we'll use a one-inch brush, and we're gonna make some little foothills that are far, far away. Far away. There. Now maybe, maybe let's go right up in here and just the corner of the brush, we're just gonna put some
little indications here of some foothills that are
way back in the distance. Super quiet little hills. Just barely can see 'em
laying back here in the mist. And I'm just pulling straight down. Just sorta let 'em disappear. Just like so. With a large brush I'll gently
lift upward a little bit, just to soften the bottom even more and make it look like mist. And maybe, maybe, maybe in your world, right here, maybe there's another
little layer of foothills. I make a lot of distance in this painting, so we can just play with foothills. You need this little
misty area in between 'em to separate 'em. Don't kill all that. You knew that. You just wanted to see if I did. There we go. Don't want much detail back here. It's too far away to have detail yet. Okay, then with a large brush, we can just gently lift upward again, just to soften the bottom. And who knows? Who knows? Maybe, maybe there's another little cloud, little misty area just
floats right down in here. Just the corner of the fan brush. This is titanium white with a small amount of magic white in it. And with a large brush we
blend the bottom of it out. Fluff it up just like we did before. And very gently just blend it. Okay. Now we're gonna have several ranges of foothills in this painting, so as you come forward,
each layer of foothills should get a little bit darker in color, a little darker in value, and that's what helps create the illusion of distance in a painting. So, to the same color, I'm
gonna add a little bit more of the Van Dyke brown, just to dull it down a little bit more. Now don't let it get too dark too soon, because we're gonna put
several layers in here. Now maybe, maybe right in here, maybe there's another little
foothill that comes right down. Just like so. Just let it wander around. There we go. Just lettin' it wander. Maybe, maybe right there. There we go. And when you start
these paintings at home, don't worry about having
an exact image in your mind of what you're gonna paint. Just start painting, and see what happens. As you paint, you'll see
all kind of things happening on your canvas, and very
soon, you'll learn to use all these beautiful
little things that happen. I think in one of the
earlier shows, I mentioned (laughs) we don't make mistakes, we have happy accidents. We learn to use anything that can happen. Anything that can happen. And that's when it really becomes fun. Okay, we'll gently lift upward here, just to create a little mist. Now, I'm gonna take the large brush and go right into the same color. Touch, and pull gently downward. Just gently downward. Start making a little
reflection back here. Very gentle. Like so. And then go across. Now, we'll take a little
bit of the magic white and add the same color to the magic white. I'm just using the magic
white to thin the paint. And we can go right back in here, and begin laying in
some little water lines. Little, tiny bit of paint on the knife, and push very hard into the canvas, you're literally just
cutting these lines in. Okay. Now then, let's come forward again. I'm going back into the Van Dyke brown, and right back into the
same original color. Just to make it a little bit darker. There we go. And maybe, right over here, maybe there's a nice foothill here. Just comes right on down. You see, this color's quite a
bit darker, so it stands out. Makes things look closer. And we can just put layer
after layer after layer of beautiful foothills, and make all kind of things happen. Recently, we did some
classes in North Carolina. Oh, that is, that's God's country. That is so pretty. And they have so many of the little hills. That just, layer after layer after layer. Sometimes, these get to be so much fun, you don't know when to stop. You just keep going. Now then, once again with the large brush. This time, I'm gonna tap it a little bit. I really wanna diffuse this one. Really wanna diffuse it. And then lift slightly upward. And maybe, take just a tiny,
tiny little bit of yellow ocher on the brush, just a tiny, tiny, tiny little bit. Very small amount. And we just lay some little
areas in between here. Very gentle. Just lifting upward. And then we can come back in here, and maybe put some more foothills. Tired of foothills yet? (laughs) This will really teach
you how to make 'em. After you do this painting,
you'll probably never again have problems making little foothills. There. And maybe we'll just let this one wander right out through here. And we'll go back, still have a little ocher left on here, and maybe just blend a
little bit of that in. And we can go right underneath it, and lay a nice little reflection. Just pulling straight down. There, we just use the
corner of the brush, and do a little bit right in there. There. Straight down. And gently, gently come across. Just enough to give it
a watery appearance. Now, a little bit more of the magic white, and a little bit of the
same color mixed into it, and we can begin putting some
beautiful little water lines right back in here. And just let 'em follow
the general contour of the land here. Once again, we're really
pushing quite hard. Really wanna push this
paint into the canvas. Like so. Maybe we'll sneak over here, add a little bit more of the
brown, a little more umber. It's getting quite dark now. And maybe we'll put (laughs)
another little foothill, right here. There we go. Maybe it just drops right down like so. There we are. And, we'll take a little bit
more of the yellow ocher. Tiny, tiniest little bit. Just enough to chance the
color scheme a little. Drop a little of that in there. Very soft. And maybe there's a few
more little foothills. Little trees, far away. Far, far away. Sometimes I like to do paintings,
when I'm painting at home, that are so soft, they
almost look like pastels. And you can do it, we use
a little brighter color than normal on TV so you can see it well, but at home, you can use any
color, any value of color, can be very quiet, very peaceful. Okay, now, let's just take it
and pull it down a little bit. Just like so. And very gently go across. And, once again, we're
ready for a water line. I'll come right along in here. And just lay in this
happy little water line. Just let him go. Okay. Now, we can begin playing a
little bit in the foreground. I'm gonna go right into
the Van Dyke brown. Right into the brown, and maybe there's, we said there's gonna be a
nice, big, high overhang here, that we were standing up and
looking down into the valley, so we'll just bring it right across. Just bring it right on across here. A lot of paint, very dark. We really want this to be contrasting. There. Okay, now we can, we can take a little bit of
the brown, a little white, make us a nice little
highlight color here, and let's just lay some
happy little highlights on top of this. Make it look like stones, and rocks. There we go, Now, maybe, maybe out
here on this old cliff, maybe there's one old tree
that's trying to make it. So, let's start right here
with just Van Dyke brown, and let's put us in a basic,
very basic tree shape. And just let this old tree wander around. You know, trees just grow
however it makes them happy. So, there's really no right or wrong. You have basic shapes,
but other than that, just just enjoy, have fun. There we go. Just let that tree just
wander right up into the sky. And you have to make these big decisions. Maybe, maybe he's got another limb that comes right up through here. Just let it travel wherever. There we go. And we're using just a small
roll of paint on the knife. Just a very, very small roll of paint. And let's put some limbs here and there. Just at random. Wherever you think there
might oughta be one. Oh, I see one right here. Right here. Maybe, maybe this one just
wanders right on over like so. Maybe he's got two arms. And a few little limbs here and there. Okay. Just let 'em wander around. And we'll put a, just
a few more up in here. Wherever. Once again, this is your tree,
so wherever you want a limb, that's where one should be. Now, I'm gonna take a fan
brush and a little bit of the yellow ocher, a little tiny bit of
sap green into, dull it. And let's just drop some little
grassy things back in here. Just so we have some little
things growing out here on this rock. Just like so. Adds a little color to the painting. Don't have to be completely monotone. Okay. Now, let's finish up our tree here. I'm gonna take a little
bit of the yellow ocher, and use that for my highlight color. Just touch. There we go. Don't overdo. Just enough to make this
side stand out a little bit. And follow the general shape of your tree. There. Okay now, let's put some, let's put some little leaves on the tree, and we'll use some Van Dyke
brown and burnt umber mixed on the one-inch brush, and let's just go and just
put in a few very loose, delicate little leaves. This little tree's had
a hard life up here. He didn't have a whole bunch of leaves. There we go. Just lay 'em in wherever
you think they should be. Isn't that a shame? All the work you did back here, and now you're putting leaves
over it and covering it up. But don't worry about it,
because it wasn't wasted. You learned a great deal,
you got a chance to practice, and that's really what it's all about. If there's a secret to it, it's practice. It's practice, that's all. Maybe, maybe, maybe there's something
that lives right there. And you can make your tree as full or as loose as you want it. Maybe these ol' limbs here have died, and they're just hanging off the side. Now, I'm gonna take a little yellow ocher, put a tiny bit of paint
thinner with it to thin it, and a little bit of the burnt umber. Quite a bit of ocher, though, we want it to be bright
enough so it stands out. And we'll go right up
here, and very gently, lay some highlights on these leaves. Don't overdo 'em. We want 'em very quiet. There. Just let 'em go. Just a few here and there. Now, next week, we're
gonna do a white canvas, so if you have your canvas
ready and sitting on the easel, you can paint right along with us and you too can have a super time. There we are, we just about
got leaves on this tree. There we are. Just drop 'em in. Alrighty, I think we're
just about finished with this painting. And this is a super nice
example of what can be done with just a few colors,
little imagination, and a happy dream in your heart. So, for all of us here at
WIPB, we'd like to wish each and every one of you, happy painting, God bless. (instrumental music)
