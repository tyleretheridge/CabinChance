hi welcome back certainly certainly glad you could join me today thought today we'd do a fantastic little winter scene just a simple little scene I think you really really enjoy doing so I tell you what I start out and having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this painting while they're doing that let's go on up here I've already covered the canvas with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white it's wet and all already so let's start today we'll use a little one-inch brush I'll start with a little touch of the CAD yellow reach over here and grab a little just a some very small amount of the bright red so we have yellow and bright red there just just load a little bit on the brush let's go right up here we will have a Sun in the sky today so decide where your son's gonna live hmm there you go there ya see my son lives with me there we go every time he goes out I move but he finds me there and that's all we have to do with that brush just just put that in wash the brush now we'll take titanium white and I'm going to reach up here and grab a touch just a touch of the lizard crimson so we have white and the lizard crimson a little there we go that's what I'm looking for load the brush full of paint let's go right up here now come right around this circle we made and do this just make little little crisscross strokes yeah it's like so and then bring it right on up till it touches the yellow there okay I fried something like it just the other day called it an egg I'm not a very good cook I burn kool-aid there that's just a veteran crimson titanium white put a little bit right down in here what the heck just throw it off now then without washing the brush same alizarin crimson white and to that I'm going to add a touch just a touch of a little blue and just mix it on the brush make sort of a little lavender color go right out here I will lay that off all of these colors are mixing with a liquid white so that makes it makes this nice soft colors and when you're doing this I really really recommend that you use the little crisscross strokes if you use these little crisscross strokes where it comes together here will be very simple to blend together if you just draw big circles around here it's a son of a gun to try to blend that together and we'll put a little bit of that same lavender color we just smear it on right here like so no big deal how this goes on okay still without washing the brush go right into some Van Dyck Brown and mix it right in the lavender that we had is just straight old Van Dyke Brown all right let's go up here now they're all the way out to the edge and in maybe a touch more the touch more the fade a little blue into that yeah that's better so we had Van Dyck Brown and played a little blue blue helps just writing it up a little I like that a little better there and while we have that on there once again we can throw a little of it right in here blue and Van Dyck Brown there we go just throw this on and some on this side all we're doing it just trying to apply some color to the canvas like we've got a mess going here today or we may we may really be in trouble with this one let's take the old big brush and using little crisscross strokes let's just begin blending all this together just blend it together now when you're doing this at home you may want to step back from the canvas several times during this blending procedure and take a look-see at it it's very hard when you're standing this close to it to tell when it's all blended out nice and smooth always start in the light airy over here and blend outward don't don't take that old dirty brush back into the center you'll mess up the beautiful light area you don't want to do that and keep it nice and clean all right just all the way up to the very edge hmm and then they wash the brush and they wash the old brush shake it off and just raise Cain there we go about it you can blend this as many times as you want to get a desired softness or lightness there's no limit to it no limit but seriously do step back and take a look at it it's hard to see up close now very lightly very lightly go across the entire canvas now I didn't down here I just want to blend all this together same way because it has the liquid white on the canvas we can blend color if this was a dry canvas you would have a devil of a time moving all this paint there we go so just bring it all together that easy I'm gonna do that same thing over here that's the beauty of wet on wet painting all right now just long strokes tough really soft me there we go hey we can wash your brush again actually addition I want to get the cameraman he's been giving me a hard time now he has freckles okay let's put a Sun in here for that I'm going to use this finger big ol finger just tap it right into the paint and go right up here now you could use a brush but finger paintings fun too and push them very firmly you just want to push that color right into the fabric now then of course if you try to blend this that paints gonna smear take your knife come right up here so we can see take your knife and just go Zoop and zip it right off the value remains in the canvas now now you can just blend it and that's one of the neatest easiest ways to make a fantastic little sign with almost no work okay I told you this would be an easy one knew you would like it tell you what let's have us a little Mountain here we'll use some Prussian blue some Van Dyck Brown and alizarin crimson blue brown and crimson okay and the more crimson you use the more purplish your mountain will become pull it out very flat cut across and get that small roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife one of the questions that I answered earlier but in case you missed it on say it again because I get so many so many letters about it people think that my knife is different than the one they're using for television they make us paint a knife black so it didn't glare my knife is just like your life until I painted it it looked what it looked like chrome very shiny but if I leave it that way on TV then it shines and makes big things come on and they yell and scream at me so I just painted with a flat black spray-paint just for the purposes of TV it's like all the shiny parts on the brushes we we put duct tape on them that keeps them from shining but they're no different than the equipment that you're using here the only thing you worried about when you're building this mountain is a nice outside edge you could care less what's happening in here scrape off all the excess paint like so okay let me wipe off my knife and then we'll take a 2 inch brush and we grab this bend the brush and firmly pull it just pull it and let it blend right down to nothing grab it and pull it see these brush strokes these brush strokes can be used to layout your entire mouth and you're not committed and it's a super way of deciding where your shadows and highlights will live just using brush strokes and you can change your mind a thousand times if you want to so sneaky little waiter to help you get through some of those some of the more difficult parts look at this see here maybe put a shadow see how you can do that maybe you want to change it and maybe you want this one to come out here like that you can do all these things and just look and get an idea of what you what it's gonna be like all right these these little things will help you use them they're your friends okay beat that little devil off and let's put some snow on this mountain we're gonna do a winter sing today so for that I use white and we're gonna put the least little amount of bright red into it the least least little amount just enough to warm it up pull it out flat nice nice roll of paint readout on the edger okay let's go up here take the point of the knife put it right up here to point your mountain touch no pressure Oh pressure just relax and enjoy let it flow just relax let it flow that easy that easy that's probably one of the biggest problem areas that people run into because they apply too much pressure to the knife take a week he'll know there you go just relax just relax there see I just let that bounce around and play have fun but no pressure I can't say that enough times maybe there's a little peak here maybe it just wanders all over the place we don't know this is your Mountain so you decide you decide wherever you want it to go that's exactly where it should go now let's put some shadows on it let me clean all these spots to work on I just have paper towels over there I'm wiping to wiping the knife and the brushes off it'll take some a little bit of Prussian blue and white I'll just mix it about like so you don't have to over mix it just like so that's that's planning once again cut off that little roll of paint it's very important that you have them now then go back in here and begin finding all these beautiful little shadow areas see them there they're just lay them in here now this is a very simple little mountain when you're doing this at home you can do a much better job you can put all kinds of things in there Oh cats and you can use the little edge of the knife or the small knife to get into these little parts there we go I will pull this down in groups right over into there see there that fantastic cause you can put all kinds of dimension into that little rascal here's a shadow right there there comes one like so and you just keep on and on and I want to bring that distinctly down you can just keep going until you get it just the way that you want it and if you live someplace where there's not a lot of mountains you can pick up some books at the library that have beautiful beautiful scenes in them or you leave the mountains out on this canvas you're the creator so you make the decision you put whatever you want in your world mountains are one of the the most popular things that we do that's the reason I do so many but if you don't want mountains in your painting leave them out okay let's take the whole 2 inch brush tap it tap it tap it create mist lift upward follow the angles I always follow the angles on the mountain like so another reason we teach mountain so much if you can make the knife work on the mountains then you can do all kinds of fantastic effects you can make rocks and trees and roads and just everything nothing teaches you to use the knife better than making mountains and this knife is a fantastic tool earlier seeing a softer base of that mountain is that's what we're looking for and to look like it's just laying here in the mist okay let's have some fun Oh take a little bit of this color that I had leftover from the mountain I'm going to add a little more crimson to it and we put some white with it like so let's see what we get here it's not quite as light as I wanna chip maybe I'll head over there it comes that counts just like so it's a nice color let me clean the knife for that we just use I got a I got a little dirty one each brush here left over from the sky it doesn't matter I'm just gonna load a little color into this wheel it that brings it to a nice sharp edge see that brush is very sharp that's a chisel edge okay let's go up here and maybe back in here there's some happy little trees at live let's just take the corner of the brush and tap and down with just tap down right we can make all kinds of things reload the brush as needed I want these to be quite loose I want all kinds of little things happening up here these are little trees and bushes that live we off in the distance and I'm tapping and pulling at the same time that let us slide a little bit just let it slide a little okay we'll just come right on across here you make the decision there we go so now let it hang down here what's hanging down here in a few minutes hopefully that'll become reflections if it doesn't then we'll just make it taller trees either way you're not worried about it cuz we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents there that's almost unbelievable to me with the completion of this series there will be a hundred and thirty half-hour shows they work me hard here and if you haven't if you haven't had the opportunity to see a mall and you would like to give you station a call let them know let them know they're available to them and they want to hear what you want and then let's take the 2 inch brush grab and pull straight down straight down that'll create the reflections we were looking for straight down so easy it is reflections used to drive me crazy now it's one of the easiest things we do now very lightly come across just come across so there is to it an instant instant reflections take a little liquid white and to that I'm going to mix some titanium white I just want this paint to be a little bit thinner so it's liquid white and titanium white now we just pull it out cut off a little bit just like we normally do there we go let's go right up in here and I want to put some happy little snow areas back in here genna's pull them genna's pull this is where we begin forming our lake or water or whatever it is back in here we don't know whatever you want to be you have to make that decision tell you what maybe there's a little yep you're right there it is just a little peninsula that comes right ahead out here so you can make all kinds of little coves and just anything that you want you can do it you can do it now that let me find there it is a clean one impression and I'm going to grab this and just and using little short strokes lift upward you see that just lift it upward just enough to miss that see just a very soft gets rid of that harsh line and blends it all together makes it look very cold and very soft and far away straight liquid right on the knife and we can go up in here and clean up the base of this and put us in a happy little water line just a happy little water wherever okay little bit right in there see they're super you can do it and they tell you what let's do I'm going to take Kate make up a mine here I'm going to take in like a big pile of dark we'll use some black Prussian blue little Van Dyke Brown some crimson whatever we got what ever we get make a big pile of paint let's get let's get the wolf fan brush loaded full of color a lot of color okay maybe we'll have a happy little evergreen and he lives right here there we are choose the corner of the brush tap down written down were down were down were down were down there there they hide right here in this brush just shake them out maybe he's got a friend over here right there there see and you put as many or as few as you want in your world maybe there's a little in there I don't know the decisions you have to me there we go another one we just decided now that one maybe there's a little one lives over here looks like a whole family getting Mama and Papa and three kids only Luke trees okay and we can take another brush add a little liquid white on it a little white and the least least a little touch a fatal blue a lot of paint on the brush let's go up here now then I just want to take that and put the indication here and there of some highlights I don't want to lose that dark value it's too pretty the contrast will be very pretty when it's done just here in your little snow laying on some of these trees just a little don't overdo you'll lose that dark contrast and that's pretty little it'll work for you in a little bit and then go into some white let's grab some Prussian blue very dark make a blue about that color go right up here yeah some happy little bushes there right there we're putting some dark in so our light will show oh we're doing right now just putting some dark in and let's reflect some of that right into the water there we go see there now 2 inch brush grab it and pull down pull straight down go across gives us some reflections now with a clean clean 1 inch brush dipped it into the into the liquid white and then into titanium white pull the brush in one direction one direction load a lot of paint into it maybe the least least little touch of the bright red case go up here touch give it a little push let's make some snow covered little bushes out of these hmm aren't those pretty there is another one right there there's another one here's one and as many as you want hmm okay let's tell you what let's do let's have a happy little cabin head back here we'll do the roof my kid a little bit of white will go there we her will get to get the small knife pull down over and down gives us a side of a little front take a little bit of dark sienna white but just a little color on there a little bit of snow on this Saturday this is where that small knife really comes in handy maybe he's a little all kinds of pretty little things there's a little door we get us a little cabin yeah take some right this is just titanium white put it right out like it like so just let it come right out and easy a little liquid white and we can drop in drop in a water line into here to clean it all up okay back to our brushes it has the white on it and we can pop in a happy little Bush here and there this guy's like me then cut his yard is just about eight his house up okay let's have some fun in the front take two a big brush and go into some pression blue and white maybe right on here well I'll just put all kinds of things in just like so maybe it comes all the way over here wherever all right yeah then there we go and we'll put a few little oh look little rascal sparkle in the side make individual bushes one at a time one at a time see and it picks up that blue color it's underneath and it's beautiful there we go can you let's go back over here there is one look at that I'm gonna leave a little water right there so let's see it going through that way we don't know where this little lake or pond goes they just look wherever lay some slow in here just titanium white it also will pick up the blue maybe it comes this way just a game of angles allow some of that blue to show through it looks like shadows and a few little things here and there like so tell you what let's get crazy let's put a little tree in here we put a little tree he lives right there right there he's got a little friend there like then a little bit of brown on the liner brush and we can just put a few little limbs on here see just like so and as many or as few as you want there to go in the old clock on the wall tells me it's about time to call it a day this painting is about finished so I hope you really enjoyed it I look forward to seeing you again next time and from all of us here happy painting god bless you
