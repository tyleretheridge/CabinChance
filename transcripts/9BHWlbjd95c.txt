- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. I thought today we'd do
something that's really cold, so you better get out your
big coat and put it on. Let's start out and have
'em run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got going. Have my standard ol'
pre-stretched double-primed canvas up here, and I just covered
the entire canvas with a very thin, even coat of liquid white. So, it's all wet and ready
to go, so let's do it. Let's start out today with the
ol', the ol' two-inch brush. We'll go into a small
amount of midnight black, a little Prussian blue, and just mix 'em together
on the brush here, mostly black, through. I just put the blue in there
to flavor it a little bit. Alright. Let's just have some fun. Very little color here. I'm just going to go
in here and just barely graze the canvas and put in
a little background color. Just a little. Just a little. I don't want this too be too dark 'cause I think I'll put some clouds in here. This is my background color. But the clouds will be the same color, only darker. There we go. Something about like that. Just enough to flavor the canvas a little. Before we get too dark, tell you what, let's have some water in this one. If you've painted with me before, you know I'm crazy about water. Probably just crazy, but
I'm crazy about water. Same color. And, I'll go right down in here, and just pull from the outside in. I'm gonna lay in a little
color that eventually, if everything goes right, will be water. There, about like that. And, very lightly, we'll just
go across the entire canvas. That little light area stays in there, that's what we were looking for. Now then, let's have some fun. Black and blue, mostly black, though. Once again, the blue is in there just to flavor it a little bit. Alright, alright, let's go up in here. Now then, let's have some big 'ol clouds and we're just gonna tap these in. I'm just gonna use a whole two-inch brush and just tap in some
very basic cloud shapes. Maybe it comes down,
goes up, I don't know. Wherever you want 'em. Just tap 'em in. There, a little more color on the brush. There we are, just tap it in. Something about like that. And, you make your own mind up where you think your cloud should live, because, we all see, we all see nature through different eyes. So, I want you to paint what you see. There, alright. Something about like that. Maybe, maybe a little more over here. Okay. Today, tell you what: gonna show you a new brush. Today, I'm gonna introduce
you to a little blender brush. This is a very soft, little blender brush, and we can just blend right
over the top of all of that. Very, very soft brush. It's much, much softer than
the normal brushes we use. There. And, this one's fantastic,
because it's thicker than most of 'em, and most important, it has a round handle. And, a round handle allows
you to actually paint with it and spin it. There we go. See how you can just blend right over all those beautiful little things? Look at there. Now then. Now then, we'll just wipe
that on a paper towel. I'm gonna come back with a knife, take some pure titanium white, and I want a bright area right up in here. So, I'm just gonna take
that titanium white, and, as my son, Steve, says,
we're just gonna smoosh it right into the canvas, like that. Okay? Like the sun's maybe behind
that ol' dark cloud there. So, we're just gonna
smoosh it right in there, just really press it in there firmly. There. Then, we go back to our
little blender brush, and this is where this
brush is so fantastic. You can just blend right over that, that easy. And, we'll tap the corner of
this brush into a little white, just a little bit of the titanium white. So, we're actually going to paint with this blender in places. And with that, then we can go up in here, and, just spinning it around,
we can make the indication of very soft, little fluffy
clouds that live in there. There, it'll make it look
like there's a few rays coming out through there,
you can just pull it. These might not show up very
much, but, in your painting, you'll see 'em. And, you can make them
as distinct as you want. And, that gives us a
pretty good ol' winter sky, it looks sorta dreary and cold and, whew! Looks like there's a storm coming already. As I say, you better
get out your heavy coat. Let's take Prussian blue, midnight black, put some Alizarin crimson in it, maybe even a little Van
Dyke, a good dark color, predominantly blue, though. Pull it out as flat as you can get it, cut across, get a little roll of paint goes right on the edge of the knife. And our world, maybe, yep. We just put us a big ol'
mountain lives right up here. Just decide where you think it
should live, and drop it in. And, the only thing
that we're worried about in this particular mountain is the top. We could care less what's
happening below it. Just that nice edge, it's
all we're looking for. Take a two-inch brush,
grab it and pull it. 'Cause we have liquid white on the canvas, we can move this color. There, now see, the soup, let it go. Make a big ol' mountain that just lives right in there like that. Come back with our titanium white, pull it out as flat as we
can get it, cut across, and we have a little roll of paint. And we just go right in there. And with that, just put
some nice highlights on this mountain, big ol'
snow-covered mountain, whew. I lived in Alaska for
almost a dozen years, and we saw a lot of this kind of scenery. Gorgeous place, absolutely gorgeous. There we go. We'll take some white,
a little Prussian blue, mix it together. And with that, we'll make
a nice little shadow color, just blue and white. There, good cold color. Cut off a little roll of paint again. And, we go up here, touch, no pressure, whew, just let it flow. Grab, now we're gonna push
that little peak back, go right to it. See, I pushed it right
into the background. There, no pressure, though. You want the paint to break like that, to have those little holes in it. That's what makes it so pretty. Makes it actually look like
something's happening in there. Little white, let's break
up this straight edge. It bothers me that it's so straight. There, we'll come right in here. Put a little shadow in the hill. Shoot, we got a little
mountain going right there. Clean, dry two-inch brush, we're
gonna create a little mist. Tap the base of it, lift upward. Always follow those angles
that are in the mountain. There we go. Now, let us have a little fun. Let's do two ranges of
mountains, just to show you how you can put one mountain
in front of another. Maybe over here we have a huge mountain, wherever you want it. Big, strong ol' mountain,
maybe there's a bump there. Something about like that. See, you have to make these
big decisions in your world. Where does all these things live? You decide. And then, just drop 'em in. That's what's so fantastic
about this style of painting. You get an idea in your
mind, and, before it escapes, you can just put it in. You can drop it right in. Back to our two-inch brush,
we grab it, and we pull. There we go. This does two things. First of all, maybe most
important, it removes excess paint, so that it's easier to
put the next layer on. Secondly, it blends it downward, creates that soft, misty look at the base. And, when you're painting mountains, that's what you're looking for. Alright. Back to our titanium white. We'll put some highlights
right up in here. There it is, see, wherever you want 'em. There, maybe right in here. See, there's one. Here comes one. (makes swooshing sound) Just let it go right on through. Just make big decisions, drop it in. You have unlimited power here, 'cause, you know you can do anything that you believe you can do. Anything that you believe you can do. There we go. Right up into here. Shoot, look at that. Big ol' strong mountain. There. Just wherever. Something about like that. I love mountains. I think they're one of the most fun things there is to paint. And, of course, none of us are interested in selling paintings, but if
you are, it still seems to be the thing that sells
better than anything else. Just great, big ol' mountains. People love 'em, they
fit in almost any decor. Don't think there's anybody
that doesn't like mountains. Well, maybe there is. There we are. Just bring it right on down. And here and there, and there
and here, you can go in, figure out where you want a little, little projection, put a
little shadow behind it and automatically it'll
stand right up in your world. Okay, take your nice dry,
clean two-inch brush. And, we begin lifting, working, tapping, always follow those angles, though. I want to create the
illusion of distance here. So, you create that misty
effect down at the base. Now then, sometimes, ♫ Sometimes, sometimes ♫ we'll just take that ol' brush, go right into some mountain
color, a little bit of white. Maybe a touch more white. There, just a little bit of color. There, see, let's go up in here. Maybe there's some little areas right here that grow right up the side. Just tap 'em in, wherever you think they should be. In that, we're gonna lift upward, and make it look like little trees that are growing back there, little trees that grow right
up the side of the mountain. I like that, that's a neat, very easy way to put in an indication of a
lot of little distant trees. See 'em? Shoot, that's where you'd ski,
is right down between those. Hopefully, not into 'em, but beside 'em. Hmm, I'm not a very good skier. I'd probably run right over 'em. There. That's the reason I took up painting, it's a lot safer. There, just lift upward, like that. Now then, while we got that
ol' color on the brush, let's just come right in
here, pull it straight down. Same color, same color,
just pull it straight down, like that. And then, go across, and we can have instant reflections. If you want to put a highlight,
take a little titanium white here and there. Don't overdo this though,
it'll ruin the effect. Just a little, here and there. And then, go across, just
enough to wiggle it a little. See, it makes it look like
light shining in there. But, don't overdo it, don't overdo it. It gets feeling good sometimes,
you don't know when to stop. Take a little of the liquid
white, cut across it, and you go right up in here, and just put in a little, a little tiny, little tiny water line lives right there. This is just a light area
between the two darks, it sorta separates. It also looks like little places where snow's laying out in the water. There. There we go. That nice? Maybe there's a big ol' thing out in here. Whatever. It's up to you. Up to you. Alright, let's have some fun. Time to get crazy. Let's mix up some Prussian blue, some back, crimson, whew,
a lot of color there. Dark, it should look black,
but it has a blue base to it. I'll even put a little
brown in, to keep it dull. There. Let me wipe off the ol' knife. And, we just wipe the
knife on some paper towels. Let's grab a fan brush. Load it full of color, a lot of color. And, let's do us a, let's do
us a little evergreen tree. Now, I'm gonna be going
over a lot of snow here, so I'm gonna dip the
brush into a little bit of paint thinner, just a small amount, because, you know, our golden rule, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So, it'll make it a
little easier when we go right over all this, it'll
stick a little easier. Here comes a nice tree. There, see? There he comes. Maybe a little of his
trunk showing right there. I like to do trees that have a little, little bit of trunk showing,
a little naked spot on 'em. Sometimes, that's sorta
neat looking in a painting, 'cause trees grow that way. They're not all perfect, they're like us. There. Or, at least, like me. I got a lot of flaws. Whew, boy, do I have a lot of flaws, I'm not even gonna talk about 'em. There we go. Having a little tree right there. And maybe, who knows, maybe there's a, another one that's hiding,
maybe he's behind back there, I don't know. Maybe, yup. In your world, you decide
how many or how few trees live there, and just drop 'em in. Just drop 'em in, wherever
you want 'em, that easy. Let's give him a friend. He's sitting over here by hisself, shoot. He'll get lonely. You know me. I think everybody should have a friend. Alright now. If this is water, maybe
we'll end up reflecting these down into the water, so
I'll just sorta do a real, a real basic little shot here, backwards, just to put the indication of a little something in the water. ♫ Doo doo, doo doo ♫ See there? We don't care if it's not perfect because we're gonna take a big brush and just sorta go right over it. Let me find a nice, clean
brush, very lightly, one hair and some air. Just enough to disturb it a little bit. See them ol' trees? Now we gotta give 'em something to set on. Right now, they're just sorta, hmm. These are floating around
out there in the water, so we have to put some land in there. Tell you what, while we got
the ol' tree brush goin', we don't want this side left out. Let's put a big tree over here. Just a big ol' tree. I like this kind of painting because it'll give you a lot of practice, a lot of practice with a knife, and with the fan brush. But the ol' knife, if
you'll spend some time learning to use that son-of-a-gun, you can paint entire paintings with him. On some of the earlier
shows, we did paintings using nothing but the knife. It's a little hard to do
in the time frame we have, but try it. It's a little slower than using brushes, but you can get some
effects that you cannot get using a brush, absolutely cannot get. I want another tree there. There we go. See, there he comes. There. And, if you learn to make one tree, shoot, you can make a million trees. That's all it takes, just get 'em right out of your brush. Tell you what, let's take a little, got a little blue and white here. Since this is such a
cold-looking painting, I'm gonna just use that
color to make the indication of a few little trunks here and there. There. Normally, we'd use brown,
but I want this painting to stay cold, real cold. There. Ahh, let's take another fan brush, we'll dip it into a little
bit of the liquid white. Titanium white, I put it in liquid white just to make it a little bit thinner, then a little bit of the,
little bit of the Prussian blue. I want a nice blue color. A little darker. See, you can make it any flavor you want. I want it a little darker,
okay, let's go up here. Now, with this brush,
we're gonna come in here, and put the indication here and there, not much, though, of some
gorgeous little highlights that live right out on these trees. Not much, not much, don't overdo. Keep this dark. It's contrast in this painting
that makes it so pretty. Keep 'em dark. There, see? Alright, on the other side over here, we'll do a little here. Don't want this tree left out. And, these threes will get mad if you forget 'em, ignore 'em. Had one chase me all the way
across the studio here one day. Hah! There. I'm a little weird, huh? I go out and talk to trees and
animals and stuff like that. But, that's okay. That's okay. I have more fun than most people, too. Alright. One-inch brush here. Let's put in a little bush here and there. I want some nice little
snow-covered bushes, so, we'll just do this. Alright. Let's go over here and
put one in here, too. There, look at there, here
it comes, here it comes. Where's it going? You knew, didn't you? There we go, you decide where they live. Nah, let me wash that ol' brush out. Just shake it off. (giggles) Beat the devil
out of it, and off we go. Let's see here. Now, let's take a little bit of white, come right back into here. Put the indication of little
bits of snow onto here, just a little snow. Gotta have something
for all this to sit on, it's just sorta hanging out
here on the lake right now, or stream, river, whatever it is. Dip the brush into liquid white, and then, I'm gonna pull it in one direction through the titanium white. The liquid white is there only to thin the titanium white. Pull it in one direction, then we're gonna carefully turn it over. Okay, let's go up in here, and, with that, then we're gonna come in here and put some gorgeous little
highlights on these little rascals. See 'em? Little snow-covered bushes
that live out here, whew, 'cause this is cold. There they are. Let's give 'em a little friend. And, you put 'em wherever
you think they should live. There we go. Go on the other side and
put some over there, too. Don't want them left out. There's one. But don't let the brush
slide when you're doing this, just give it a little
oomph, a little push, bend those bristles a tiny bit, tiny bit. And, if you start picking
up that base color excessively, you're always
going to pick up a little, but if you pick it up excessively, then your paint on your
brush is too thick. Add a little touch more
of the liquid white to it. There, oh, it looks cold. I think the temperature
here where we're painting has dropped 10 or 15 degrees
just since we started this. I like to paint. Paintings like this, gorgeous. Alright, now then, tell you what. Let's get crazy today. Maybe in our world lives
a little house out here, 'cause I, I'd like to
live in a place like this. So take your knife,
scrape out a basic shape. That just removes excess paint. We'll take a little of Van Dyke
brown, a little dark sienna mixed together. We'll put the back roof
in first, back eve, like that. That's all there is to it. Now we'll put the front in. (makes swooping sounds) And, all we're doing here
is blocking in color, it doesn't much matter. You can do this any ol' way you wanted to. Just blocking in color. Then, we take some, little white, little dark
sienna, little Van Dyke brown, mix 'em together so they're marbled. Cut across, and very lightly, barely touch, just like you're
putting snow on the mountain. Barely touch, just touch it, pull. Maybe a little more over
here so it shows up. Ooh, that's nice. That's so nice. Take a little dark color, just make it look like old boards. Little of the Van Dyke. Got a little door. Little touch of light color, sorta outline it, so we
know where the door's at. Shoot. Now, all we need is the
other half of the roof, so he doesn't freeze. So, we'll take a little
bit of the titanium white, just put it on right
there, ooh, like that. Now, we need a little over here, so it looks like the snow's
deep on the roof up here. Okay, now. We'll just take a little touch of snow, put it right down here, wherever. Right on across. See there? But, pay attention to angles. You want that to flow, 'cause chances are, if
there's water out here, it's in a recessed area. Normally, water always
is in this recessed area. So, alright. We can come back when we find my brush that we was making bushes with. Come back, a little liquid
white, titanium white, and let's put some little
bushes all around here. Look at 'em, see? They about to eat up right
around the front door there. Alright, a little bit,
maybe this guy's like me, he didn't cut his yard
very good in the summer, and now the bushes are growing
right up, right up like that. We could even take a little touch of, little touch of blue and white, let's make an indication
of maybe a little path that comes right out here. So, he's got a way to walk out. Take the knife, scrape in a few little sticks and twigs here and there. Something like so. Little bit of the liquid white,
put a water line into here. Something about like that. I like these kind of paintings. They say, they give you a lot of practice with the ol' knife. And, that's what you need. That's what you need. Few little sticks over here. Just scrape right through the paint, let the canvas show through. Alright, I think we got
a finished painting here. Hope you enjoyed this one. Give it a try. Send me a photo of what you do. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you, happy painting. May God bless, my friend. (theme music plays)
