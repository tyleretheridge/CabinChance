welcome back glad to see you today and today let's just have some fun let's just do a quick little painting here that'll make you happy in here I'm gonna start out with a little tiny bit of a little blue and we'll just beat it right into this large brush and start right up in here and just sort of vary this just work it around want to leave some light areas in the sky you don't want to kill all the light areas just work it around there we go and let's see that'll give us enough to start with and while I've got this on the brush add a little bit more of the blue and a tiny tiny little bit of phthalo green not much not much it's very strong just a little bit and we just comes out here like that just very quickly drop in what will eventually be water fairies now we can wash this old brush get off excess paint thinner and cover the studio okay now with a clean dry brush we're just gonna gently blend this out just blend it out just have fun enjoy don't try to kill all these little white areas they end up making things happen in the sky you don't end up with this guy that looks like you pulled the window shade down at night some action in it little things that are happening okay they're super nice quick little way to make a happy little sky now I'm going to take some Prussian blue and alizarin crimson another pression blue is a hundred times stronger than the crimson so use very little blue get quite a bit of crimson and if you want to test it take a little white and put somewhere else you pull a little bit of the color and put it into it that's really about the only way you can tell exactly what you have this just looks black it's so dark okay so that's about what I'm looking for so now we'll use the fan brush put a little bit of the color in here very little very little want a very soft little painting today and let's just go right up in here just put us a just a little basic mountain shape just however you want it just let it sort of sit or go off into nothing over here I will gently pull some of that down just very basic shape we're not looking for detail in this mountain and our other series we've really put a lot of detail into mountains and this time though we do other things we've done a lot of buildings in this series gonna do some more for it's over with okay now with a large brush I'm just gonna grab a hole and pull it down just like so don't spend a lot of time worrying about it this is just a little little mountains way back in the distance they're how easy that is now maybe maybe there's one a little closer maybe just like a little Foothill or something and maybe it's just like this and we want it to be a little darker a little bit darker so I'm going to add a little more paint into this one as these things get closer to you allow them to get darker that helps create distance in your painting okay very gently we'll just pull this one you can you can move this paint all over the canvas the magic White's underneath and it allows the paint to slide and that click we have two very nice ranges of hills in the background here now the only thing it separates these two is the light area in between and the difference in value this one's much darker than the one is far away so it creates the illusion of distance already okay let's take a a little bit of SAP green and throw it right into this purple color we have so we have SAP green a little bit of blue and alizarin crimson there just put it all together this should be predominantly green okay now then let's just take the one-inch brush and load it full of paint let's pull it through the paint put a lot of paint into the bristles a lot of paint maybe will lighten that a tiny bit I want to add the least little amount of white to it just to lighten it up a little a little bit of white don't get carried away a lot of pain in the bristles now let's go right up in here and we'll put some little distant trees back there they are let the brush work that's the fresh work Janice faraway little trees and you can put as many trees in your world as you want just let them happen let them happen don't worry about them enjoy have fun so how easy it is to make little distant trees it really gives the illusion of trees that are far far away over here I want to just sort of fade out this whole side of this painting just sort of fade out into nothing just indications okay now we can take the large brush and very gently lift upward just to create a little bit of mist down at the bottom there just a little bit of mist now we know there's going to be some water back here so we can begin working on some reflections and just begin pulling a little bit of this day off not much at this time just a little bit I'm not going to worry about it right now now we'll go right into the missus SAP green alizarin crimson and impression blue we just mix it right here on the brush and maybe maybe maybe here's a tree lives right there there he is we're just putting in some basic shapes maybe he's got a friend lifter right along here and all kind of little things are happening all down this area just let them happen I want this to get very light over here to sort of disappear maybe there's another little tree here a little bush or tree you have to make these decisions what you want it to be now I'm going to take a little bit of this color it's a very brownish looking color and just wipe a little bit of it like this just a little bit of it just pull it across and with my large brush pull it on out a little wanted to go right into the water there we are with this water to have a brownish hue to it up close to the land like you can see some of the land through the water it's good okay a little bit more of the SAP green does in crimson pression blue I put the blue in to make it much darker much stronger the blue is so so strong and maybe right over here maybe oh there's a almighty tree a super big tree lives right here just have some fun with him and all I'm doing is just putting in the dark so the light will show sort of think of it as painting the back of the tree and then we'll paint the center of the tree which is the trunk and then we'll do the front of the tree which is the highlight now maybe there's some all kinds of little things living back in here just make up little dreams in your mind and put them on canvas okay now let's go into take a little titanium white some van Dyck Brown a little bit of the umber burnt umber there but I touch a blue into it to gray it just a little bit of blue brown white touch of blue I had grieves it down very nice now we're ready now we're ready now we can begin laying in some nice little land areas back in here she drop them in sea by not over mixing your paint all these beautiful colors happen automatically if you mix it till it's dead then you only have one color here we have a multitude of colors happening there we go back in here just want this to slowly just disappear right on into nothing and let's go right into a little bit of Van Dyck Brown and Burr number and up in here we'll make this darker much darker right up through here Van Dyck Brown and just a touch of umber there you go and we can sort of just gently bring these together let a little the highlight go up on the dark a little bit of the dark come down to this lighter color there okay now we're ready to start doing some playing back here let's put some little trunks in these trees just take the pallet knife with a little brown on it drop some in wherever you think it should be a truck that's where he would be let's drop it a little bit of brown and white for highlight keep these quite Sidhu they're far away we don't want them too bright you okay now my mind that I'm gonna give this tree here shot of vitamins and make him grow a little see how you can make a tree grow just wanting to be a little stronger okay now we can start highlighting some of these and I'm going to take a little bit of the paint thinner into the brush a little bit of yellow making a very thin paint here very thin yellow in SAP green very thin then paint will stick to a thick paint so you need to start with a very thick paint so you can put this thin paint over the top of it and let's just do this just touch and let's begin highlighting some of these little trees just let it drop right off the brush there we go maybe we'll add a tiny bit of ochre to it just to change the color yellow ocher a little bit smile I try to appear on this little tree there and while we got the brush going here maybe we'll just get right over in here and drop some happy little things on top of this one too so let them happen some down in here a little bit darker cuz they're a little bit lower maybe not as much lights going to strike down there there just let these little things fall right out of your brush over here just want to sort of disappear right off ended nothing and let's go right up in here there is another one and let them come right down to the land all kinds of little ferns and things that are growing this sort of reminds me of some of the little coves that you find in the coast of Oregon have all the beautiful greenery get got yourself so many many beautiful beautiful areas organ is probably one of my favorite States it reminds me a great deal of my home in Alaska have the beautiful mountains and some of the fantastic scenery there we go okay I think maybe we better better put us a tree trunk in there and let's have a big old tree just comes right up through here they're Van Dyck Brown just let this tree just wander around put some little limbs all out here in tree a lot of these will be covered up but some of them will show it'll make you treatment much much more interesting if you can see some of these Gina's tear neck and at home where you have unlimited time you can just put all kinds of detail let's drop a little highlight right here on the trunk okay so it stands out nice this is just a little brown and white and right on up into the limbs there they go nice to hear okay now let's add some nice leaves to this tree maybe we'll start with a dark green SAP green the paint is very thin and we can begin just dropping some leaves right out here very thin paint sticking to that thick paint is underneath all we're doing is just touching the canvas this brush is a little bit different than the ones we've normally been using it's round so it makes all these beautiful little round shapes and we just let them drop right out there you know in each series I try to introduce something new to you that you haven't seen before just to keep you excited and to keep you interested in this series we've introduced the magic black which does fantastic things I think we had a we had a super time with it okay now we'll take a lighter green and add some CAD yellow to it and we'll come back and put another little highlight up here maybe even a little bit lighter than that chin so just add a little more yellow oh yeah now that stands out beautifully just one enough difference in color so it stands out and then highlight these individual little things in the tree all kinds of little things happening out here and work with some basic patterns in the tree don't just hit it random think about it think about how limbs are projecting out here toward you and they have shape and form and they're different than limbs that are going out the side look at trees spend some time just just sit out in the yard or something one day and set and look at trees there we go just a few more we'll have this old big tree all finished here and we can put some little things down in here now let's get out here and play with the water a little bit we take a little bit of magic quite a little bit of the firm white and put the magic white in just a thin it a little and we can begin coming right in here putting some water right up to the to the land there we go with the old fan brush it's very simple and do it in just a matter of seconds and brushes a super super brush you you have to make friends with it though takes a little while it's not the easiest brush in the world to master but once you do oh my gosh what you can do with it what you can do with an entire paintings can be done very easily with it just the fan brush there today's put some little indications here in there okay nano now we can get crazy let's take some Brown Van Dyke Brown a little bit of burnt umber in it not much just a little umber just a little bit of home birth and maybe will come right there just drop in some color don't be afraid of it just throw it in the dark in order for the light to show so all we're doing here is just adding some dark let's just let this come all the way across what the heck what this is our world so we can do a lot to King maybe maybe maybe maybe you have a happy little tree that lives right here so we put some dark in same colors of dark just there oh there's one I see one right there right there I'm doing this just laying in some dark not really worried about shape or form yet and we can take a little bit of a highlight color and very lightly just touch and pull this is brown and white Burr number very gently just pull like so yeah we could come back and begin laying in all kinds of little little things happening all over here need something a little lighter it's not going to show right there so we're just there that's what I was looking for knew it was in there we just had to find it there's just all kind of little things going right along in here and right in here just drop them in highlight on them just nice soft little fern looking things there we go and that fantastic and next week we're going to do a I tell you what let's do next week let's do the little the little painting that we animated at the beginning of the show the little light house so have a black canvas ready we'll do a black one next week there we go a few little highlights right up in here just drop them on let him go and sort of later these it'll give distance to your painting they're all kinds of little things happening wherever you think they should be that's where they should be like so and we take the knife and just just here and there gently scrape in a few little sticks and twigs and they can be all over wherever you think there should be a little little twig showing here and there just drop it in and all I'm doing is using the pointed knife cutting right through the paint and allowing a little bit of the canvas to show through we're not really putting any color on the canvas just like it may be right up in here one couple over in this area let you see in the background and let's take right in here maybe just add a little tiny bit more that's growing right down almost a ground level like so there okay I think we have a painting that's about ready for a signature so let's take the liner brush a little bit of the thin oil and I'll go right into some permit RIA that's sort of my color for signatures and we'll just drop a little signature right there like so as I say next week have your black canvas ready and we'll do a will do that little Lighthouse that's such a fun painting I think you're really enjoyed there we go Sian sealed and delivered and the old clock on the wall tells me I got to get out of here and leave you for this week we're looking forward to seeing you again happy painting bye bye you
