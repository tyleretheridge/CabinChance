hey welcome back certainly glad you could join me today today let's do just a happy little painting is such a fantastic day I'm glad you with me so tell you what let's start out and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and today we have as you can plainly see a black canvas up here now to get a black canvas all you do is take a white canvas and cover it with black gesso allow that to dry completely and then we cover it with a thin even coat of transparent color today I've used a mixture of phthalo blue with a little bit of SAP green into it and I've just covered the entire canvas with just a thin coat and you just sort of touch it and if you get on your finger here if you get a little bit of color then that's just right you don't want it too thick or it becomes very difficult to work with just then even coat and that's the hardest part of this painting is putting that paint over the black gesso rest of its easy let's start out today with the old 2 inch brush go into a little bit of titanium white you know as I've mentioned before and I do these black canvasses if you're ever painting in front of friends or family do these black canvasses and put the color at the base color on before you before you go out and to do your demonstration and then when you hit this with white paint the beautiful colors happen and people think there's something magic happening and don't tell them the secret that's between you and I now then maybe we'll have a little bit of light up here in the sky I think we'll do a happy little waterfall today so we're just going to start right up here just pick out an area just making little criss-cross strokes just begin laying in a little bit of color and you can see how that just comes alive that blue and green underneath there just really makes it jump out at you it's super super nice way of making very effective little paintings and color stands out so much brighter on a black canvas and now you can keep going back and make this as light as you want it or leave it very dark it's totally up to you painting is a very individual thing so create your own world take it the way that you wanted and then it's just right okay now we have a little light area up in the sky let's wash your brush we'll just scrub it off good ol odorless paint thinner I've got a screen in the bottom of the can so it allows the solid materials to sort of settle down to the bottom shake it off and just beat the devil at it as I mentioned before you can change the decor of your room in one heartbeat doing that one thing I want to show you I've got a lot of letters in people saying how do I contain this so I brought a little brush breeder rack out here to show you today it's a very simple little device and it just goes right in the bottom bowl of a waste paper basket and you take shake the brush inside of the basket when you beat the bristles firmly against this it contains it only a couple of bucks and it'll save you a happy home your marriage can't believe let's start out today I'm going to use we just take the old one-inch brush this going to touch the phthalo blue little brown be right back maybe a little black a little crimson I'm just looking for a dark color here there we are a little more that crimson I like that alright maybe there's a little hill back here far away let's just take this just tap down just make the indication of a little hill far away not looking for a lot of detail here it's too far back there we go just blend it on down we're going to cover most of that up a little bit of it will show I think and that'll give us an indication of a hill far away tap it a little bit help create that illusion of mist left slightly upward that's all there is to it shoot that easy today let's use let's use this old big Brush sometime we're so afraid of this brush because it's big but let's use it today I'll show you what you can do we'll take a little blue on it we grab some SAP green here I need some SAP green now then let's just begin we'll just tap it a little here let's begin deciding where little individual trees live here these are closer I have a little more detail and I'm just using just the brush just tapping this big brush wherever you want back up in here maybe there's just all kind of little trees Lily back in there excuse the noise it's just where I'm tapping there we go there we go just wherever you want alright these are just going to be indications of trees and bushes and stuff that are far away far away now I'll take that same color liner brush paint thither make it very thin turn that brush turn it okay now that may be back here we can't make out the indication of some little tree trunks here and there not a whole bunch just see a few there now you can do these with a light color also and they'll stand out very pretty then we add a little white to that make it a little bit lighter and watch how they stand out there okay just wherever you want and as many or as few as you think should be there now let's have some fun maybe into our world there's a big waterfall of limbs right here we go and give you the bravery test right here this is your bravery test let's see if our waterfall lives here this is just titanium white on the large brush decide where he lives touch like so and pull it down just touch it and pull it what could be simpler touch and pull there we are and decide how big he is just pull him straight down so big brush will do some fantastic things for you there okay and then maybe down at the base of our waterfall there's some beautiful mist for that I'll just use the old fan brush a little bit of the titanium white and we got to make some big decisions here maybe our waterfall just hits right down in here and I'm just spinning that brush just spin it wiglet push it make all kinds of just beautiful little shapes just get crazy with a brush just let it go there this is where you take out all your frustrations just let that rascal spin in there and carry on and it's picking up the color this underneath there see normally if you do this on a canvas ax you've just ruined it but here this is what you have fun this is where you have fun now we take a clean two inch brush and very gently just begin winding that I've just blend it blend it blend it you can create some of the most beautiful little misty areas tap it blend tap and tapping really diffuses it yes wherever you want there we go let's creep all kinds of mysterious and very lightly we can blend out all the little marks it looks like we just have a cloud of mist hanging there maybe a little more right in here I want this to be a little bit brighter so you do the back one first and it'll be like is another layer of mist laying here but do the one the back one first have it totally finished and start this one if you want to create several different layers within this misty area okay we'll just blend this one blending blending blending tapping there we go okay give it a little Buffett like so and we're in business we have another layer of mist and you can just make a layer after layer after layer creed unbelievable depth in your painting okay about time to wash your brush here scrub it off and we're in business all right I'm going back to the big old two inch brush here a little bit of the blue and be right back little SAP green now we can begin just putting some things over here it's a very basic little shapes maybe there's trees that live on this side of that big old waterfall just think about basic little shape you want and all you doing here is just tapping just tapping there we are now I'm going to begin adding a least little touch of the yellows little yellow ochre little CAD yellow same old brush just begin putting the indication here and there just a little highlight a little more detail there that's hanging right out over here in front of the waterfall mmm see how that pushes that waterfall back though it creates another plane in your painting and that's exactly what we're trying to do want to add a little black to that get up in here it put some darker things either farther away their dark basic tree shapes tell you what I'm going to be tackling some of these little tree shapes you know painting painting so fantastic because over the years I've met all literally hundreds and hundreds of beautiful people and they've painted with me and they brought a lot of joy to my heart I'd like to share a little piece of film with you and show you somebody here thank you like it opportunity to travel to Music City USA nashville tennessee and paint with one of country westerns living legends mr. Hank snow Annette Kowalski and I had a private class for Hank and several of his friends from the Grand Ole Opry one of the participants was grant Turner the voice of the Grand Ole Opry and the only announcer to be honored in the Country Music Hall of Fame also present was Fred perta a fantastic gentleman who makes everything work behind the scenes at the Opera Jimmy Snow Hanks son allowed us to painted his television studio for a couple of days Jimmy and his wife Dottie recorded this historic event on film so we could share a couple of minutes of it with you and now here we are on the last day of painting I've learned more in the last couple of days and I could learn a year really well thank you shoot you doing almighty painter thought of a good have his own TV series coming up real soon here look for Hanks knowing the joy of painting I think thank you very much I really enjoyed painting with you my pleasure Bob I got can I show him your hand so the other Hank works not that one Hank paints his hand too ain't that fantastic I thought you'd enjoy seeing Hanken boy that son of a guns a fantastic painter you know he's so talented he can sing and he can paint I don't think there's anything the man can't do and I was very honored to have the opportunity to paint with Hankin and grant Turner and Fred they're fantastic people in from the bottom of my heart I thank them for allowing me to to be a little part of their world there okay I've just tapped in some little things here now I've got the liner brush I'm going through a little bit of black and the colors I want put in the indication here and there of a few little tree trunks that are we back here in the distance we back here when you're doing this if you have trouble making the paint stick all you have to do is just add a tiny bit of paint thinner and so you just put all kinds of little limbs and sticks and wherever you want to just sort of think about really would live and then drop them in so all there is to it same old same old brush here we go into some Indian yellow CAD yellow yellow ochre just mix these colors up now they're all these dark colors we put on here now I'm just going to begin putting some highlights here and I want this to stay very dark so I'm not looking for a lot of color just indications begin thinking about individual little trees though in here there's a nice one maybe a little lights hitting him he's standing out here in the Sun like that see just just using a spigot brush you can make all kinds of things there we go maybe here's another one look at that there he is big old tree he lives right up there there here's another one and you can put a layer after layer after layer of beautiful tree indications without heart of doing a thing this is the lazy man's way of painting okay now then this whole waterfalls coming we off up there splashing making all that shoot it's time to have some fun let's go into some Van Dyck Brown dark sienna get some black looking for a very dark dark color let's go up here maybe there's a big stone that's right about here boy look at that rascal just have to make a decision where does he live drop him in and we'll just paint that in with a fan brush there okay now then same old color maybe there's some little stones back in here you know if there's all these big stones they're gonna be little stones now just by changing the brushstrokes here with the least little amount of color we'll use a little dark seeing a little white but the least little amount on the brush want this to stay dark you can create the illusion of all kinds of little rocks and things happening in but mainly with just your brush strokes you really don't have to work a lot see already that looks like pickle rocks and it's just the brush strokes let them work for you shoot if you can do it easy I work at it maybe there's some mist down here at the bottom of this okay we'll take our brush and just tap this and work it all kinds of nice misty areas down here just let that blend right up in T Rock sir just lay that son-of-a-gun right down into the right down into the mist all right and we'll dip the brush into the smallest amount of liquid white and go into the titanium white load the brush full of color and out of this mess back here we're going to begin seeing water coming in tune it's going to fall and splash and have fun we don't know where all it goes and where it's headed push upward to make little foamy things there and there's stones underneath the water that you don't see let's let it go let it go just sort of think about where little stone lives push Bend all kinds of these little stream just so much fun to do mmm just think like water you run it along here and having a good day it's a good day and all of a sudden some sort of a gun pull the bottom out pooping you fall let's make up a little story see there there he comes what little stream just keeps on moving in a meandering down there where every yarn maybe he just comes right on out still falling in places there's rocks and stones and old trees there they are maybe there's a little beaver hiding in there whatever that's a pretty fast stream for a beaver but maybe maybe he's a fast beaver whatever okay and then let's put in a few more stones and what are you doing yours put in as many rocks and stones and things as you want in there you can just drop them in maybe there's up big and lives here big rock over here now once again just use brushstrokes in the least little amount of color and you can create all these illusions of little stones and or oxen but it takes very very little paint very little paint so let that old fan brush just work there mmm I love these little black canvasses they're so so effective there we are maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe right about there we'll just put another Rock they just sort of make up ideas and drop them in whatever whatever feels good do it it feels good and it doesn't hurt anybody else and then it's alright so alright dad in here we go Jim we'll just change that into a little waterfall that falls right off there and it splashes up against the base of these rocks there it goes I don't know shoot maybe just run right off the canvas over here we don't care wherever you want it this is just titanium white a little liquid white to thin and tiny bit and then it's picking up the color that's on the canvas so the canvas is working for you you don't have to do anything just rub a little white paint on it I get so many letters from people that that have tried this and it's working for them and whole new worlds have been discovered especially my young friends there's so many young people all over the country who writen you can't believe what they're painting just absolutely can't believe and it creates an interest in art carrying for nature and anytime you can instill that in a young person it's so fantastic because they're the greatest people in the world and we got to keep this old planet together boy because it's all we got at this point maybe one day we'll have something else right now though this is it so we have to take care of it it's one of the reasons I like to show all the little birds and stuff on the show we don't want to lose them and people like the bird lady here in Muncie that take care of them they're special people special people and there's probably someone in your area that does the same thing shoot go see them they're usually glad to show you what they're doing they need your support and help and they're they're really providing a worthwhile service somebody has to take care of these little rascals I'm just doing the same old thing here get off my soapbox I talk too much some time there toot and grab another fan brush maybe down here maybe what don't take a little blue go into this the yellows want this to be dark and we grab a little more black it's too light they're just right on a fan brush a little bit of that dark greenish color maybe there's some little grassy things that live down here on right down here witness a beautiful place to to come and hike or fish or whatever you do I love to fish I'm an avid fisherman I'm not a very good fisherman shoot I catch the fish I put a little bandaid on him get a little CPR pat you on the - to put him back in the water wish him well come back next week try to catch him again we leave him there then he's there for the next time back to the old big brush other fisherman sort of frown upon me sometime the way I fish I think that's the way to do it that way everybody has a chance to catch you there we are I'm just putting in all kinds of little indications here just bushes and stuff not looking for a lot of detail when things are so thick like it and they grow together it's hard to find individual details okay maybe right here Lizza just a happy little rascal and all we're doing here is just taking this large brush and tapping downward you know a lot of times when there's this much water you have a lot of moss and a lot of trees that they hang they had a lot of hanging downs on them and it's so pretty it's beautiful just let it hang right out over the water there there we go okay I have it let's take our little liner brush here I'll go right in to this is sort of a grayish color let me get a little more thinner I don't have quite enough that I'm right back there we are what is to be very thin almost ink consistency and here and there and there and here back here in these trees I just want to sneak back in here put the indication of some tiny little tree branches and stuff that are growing just a few and it's a little detail to your painting and if you're out selling paintings of course we don't do that but if you're ever out selling paintings this is what makes your painting sell well somebody else was stand there and frown at you because they're painting doesn't sell it's these little details the fact that you care enough to do the extra things that's what makes it nice years ago I used to travel all over and do demonstrations and sell paintings and sometimes people would get so angry because my paintings would sell and there's wooden and I'd invite them to come over and paint with me shoot and try to tell people if somebody's doing better than you are don't get mad at them out what they're doing that's working shoot don't waste your time getting mad at them just learning what they're doing and outdo them you can do that can do anything just here and there well I just got all kinds of little sticks and twigs maybe over here there's some growing over here maybe a bird dropped a little seed here and there's just a little tree came up and there he goes he's tired little tree boy he's had a tough life out here tough old life like me he's had a hard time ah there you got to make those little groaning moaning noises or it doesn't work if you're doing a treat is tired and then your mind think about being tiring there all right tell you what let's go over here grand mobile fan brush it's got the dark color on it get a little the brown and the black I'm gonna want to just put the indication right in here under this there's some nice stones these little stones with a fan brush here fun to make you can just put as many or as few as you want in your painting just keep them going there we are sure hope you enjoyed seeing Hank grant and Fred painting with me well they are some of the most super people I've met so many wonderful people painting I wished I could show you everybody that
