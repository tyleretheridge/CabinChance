- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us, today. I thought today we'd do a little seascape. One that's real easy, and I believe you're going to enjoy it. Let's start out and have
them run all the colors across the screen, that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you this crazy canvas I got up here, today. Today, I've taken my standard
old 18 by 24 inch canvas, but I've painted the top with
alizarin crimson acrylic. Let me say that again. It's acrylic on top, and the bottom is black gesso. Then, I covered the entire thing with a very thin coat of the Liquid Clear. Down here, on the bottom, I've taken a little
impression blue and sap green, and ran across just a little bit. Down here, a little brown made from alizarin crimson and sap green. So, there's brown on the bottom, sort of a blue-green here, and this just has clear
on it, and we'll play. All right. Just getting the introduction
there was a biggie. Let's take a little titanium white, and then I'm going to
come right around here, get a little bit of the midnight black, and I'm going to make a gray color. Just white and black, or black and white, whatever your preference. Now then, let's go right up in here. And, I'm just going to... just going to dance in a few
little areas here and there. Just a light gray color. I don't want to cover up all
this red, but here and there. I want to have just
some little indications. The white is very opaque, but if you get it thin enough the red will still show through. It'll give a reddish hue to our painting at least in the sky. There, something about like it. That's basically what we're looking for. Just some little
indications here and there. All right. Once again, I don't want
to kill all this red. I want it to come through the color. So, you need to really thin it out. And because the Liquid Clear is on there, you could get this very thin, and it'll work out for you very nicely. There. Now while I have my little brush going, I'm going to take a
very, very small amount of phthalo bule. Just a little bit on
the old two inch brush. Very small amount. I just want to tint the sky here and there with a little phthalo blue. Not much, not much. Be careful. Once again, I don't want
to lose this reddish aura that we have through the entire painting. Just want to add a little
blue here and there. But once again, not much. Maybe a little right down in here. Just where ever, where ever, and we'll sort of play
back and forth as we work. Now, then. Okay, time to wash the old brush 'cause that's a fun part. I just really look for
excuses to wash the brush. Shake off excess. (brush smacks) And, just beat the devil out of it. There we go. Let's build us today,
a happy little cloud. I'm going to take a little titanium white, right on the old two inch brush. Same old brush. And, let's go up in here. Let's just drop in an
indication of some little clouds that live up in here. Maybe, where ever. It doesn't much matter. Where ever you think they should live. That's exactly where they should be. Just some basic little shapes. Okay, I'll be right back. I'm going to grab a blender brush, here. This is a very, very soft
little blender brush. It allows you just to blend
these things together. That easy, that easy. All right. See how easy it is to make
a fantastic little cloud. You can do this. All you need is a little practice, the right equipment, and off you go. Okay. So, what makes this style of painting so unique and so wonderful
is that anybody can do it. You don't have to be blessed
by Michelangelo at birth. You can create a beautiful painting. Yeah, you can do it. All right, maybe a
another little happy cloud lives right here. Notice, we're doing them in layers though. Now then, back to my little blender. La, la, la. There we are. Just blend it away, blend it away. Where ever you want it to go. There. See, but this keeps the
edge nice and firm there, by doing it in layers. So don't get greedy. I know, it gets good,
you don't want to stop. You want to do them all at one time. But take your time, take your time. Just try to do one at a time. There, maybe. I'm just letting this
sort of dance around. Maybe comes right out, here. Wherever. We're going to have some big
clouds in the sky, today. So, you just decide where you want them and drop them in. It's really that easy, just tap them in. Maybe there's even a little bit that goes off in here, somewhere. Back to our little blender. That's all I'm doing, just
picking up the blender, and then we begin putting these together. Just blend them away. Very softly. We're going to have a
monster sky in this one. I can tell. There. That little blender brush
though, it's so soft. You could go right over the
paint without mixing it all up. There we go. I want to just feather those edges out 'til they're very quiet. You almost don't see them. They just sort of disapear. There we are. About like that. That's all we need. It's all we need. All righty, that's looking
like a pretty nice little sky. I like to do skies like this. They're a lot of fun. Little more white, I'm not stopping yet. I think we'll just put another
happy little cloud in there. Maybe it comes around like that goes off. You make a decision. In your world, you decide
where everything lives, the clouds, the sky, little birds. There. I'm just going to put
another little cloud here. You know, in one of the earlier shows, a couple of the early shows, I showed one of my little baby squirrels that I'm raising, right now. We've had so many people write and say, "I want to see him again." So, I'm going to put up
a little footage here, and let you just check
out my little squirrel. This is the one we call Pea Pod Junior 'cause he sort of likes
to live in my shirt, too. Yeah, isn't he a mess? I love these little rascals. They're so much fun to feed, and to play with, and to work with. It ceates a whole new awareness of nature when you work with
little animals like this. Probably in every town
nearly in the country, there are people who work with injured and orphaned animals. This is where I get all these
little animals that you see. I try to work with these
people and help them out. Anyway I could make their
life a little easier. And, they allow me to share
just what you see, right there. Some of God's little creatures. Isn't he adorable? By the time you see this, he'll be living out in my backyard 'cause we do not keep
these little animals. These are wild animals. They're meant to live outside, and that's where we put them. But hopefully, he'll
hang around the backyard, and allow me to continue to share his world for a little while. Look it there. He's not the neatest
eater in the world, is he. But that's okay. Every year, I raise several of these little rascals and turn them loose. There, just gives you a good feeling. All I'm doing is just
putting in some clouds while you watch little
PeaPod Junior, there. All right, he wouldn't share either. You noticed that? That's totally his. None of that's for me. Okay. I think we bought have
a little sky finished. Hope you enjoy watching
those little critters 'cause they really are fun. And, they're very important in my life. I took a little touch of the phthalo blue, and just add it right there. Just a little touch. All right. Now, I have a little piece
of masking tape, here, just to protect my horizon line. But that's the only reason it's there. Little touch more of the phthalo blue. Already have white on this blender, so they'll just sort of mix together. Ain't that a wild sky? I bet there's a storm coming, here. All right. Now then, I get to wash the old brush again. That's really all I wanted to do. We wash our brushes as you know, in orderless paint thinner. (brush taps)
Shake off the paint excess, and just beat the devil out of it. Okay. I'm going to take off this little piece of masking tape. See, that way my horizon
line is nice and straight, and very even. That was prussian blue and sap green. I'm going to add just a touch more where the piece of tape was. There. Just adding a little bit more. Like that, okay. We're in business. I thought today, let's play a little bit. Seascapes give some people a hard time. They're not the easiest
thing in the world, to paint. So, let's make a seascape that's a little easier to do, today. We're going to use the small knife a lot. I'm going to take a little roll of paint, and I'm going to start out by just figuring out basically here where my major wave will be. I want one big crasher wave. It comes right up here. Maybe it bends over like that. And, maybe there's a little dooder there. And, off sort of like that. That's really about all we're looking for. It's just a shape to tell
us where the old big wave's going to live in our world. And back here, maybe there's a little
wave that lives there. Putting a lot of pressure
on the knife, bending it. If you don't get too crazy,
the knife's pretty strong. You're not going to break it. Now, I will take a number three fan brush. I'm going to use the small one, today. Very gently, I just want to
blend that back a little bit. Just enough, just enough to do that. See, we don't want to lose... It's the dark area right
here, that's important. Don't lose it. Hang on to it. It's a good friend. Just blend a little
bit of that color back. Just a little, see. Don't get too crazy. I know, I know. It gets nice. And, a little bit in here, a little bit there. Now then, tell you what. We'll have that little brush going. I'll take a little more titanium
white, and back in here. I'm just going to put
some little indications and some little strokes, that will make it look
like little distant waves, far, far away. Something about like so. We're not too worried about these. We'll sort of put them together with the liner brush, when
we put detail in there. There. But that' really about all we need. It gives indication that
something's happening back here. Other than that, not too worried. There. Now then, let's have some fun. Let's have some fun. We'll take some more a
little titanium white. I'm getting a little roll
of paint on the knife. Right down to the edge. It lives way out there. Now, we said that this water was going to come around here like this. So, all we're going to do is just touch and give a little pull. Give a little pull. Like that. There. That's going to be the top of that wave. Grab my little number
three fan brush again. I'm just going to barely touch this, and give it a little
tiny pull over like so. And, that's about all
I'm going to do to that. Now, we need an eye in the wave. Or, as it's commonly
known, the pretty part. We take a little titanium white, and go right up in here. And, just begin rubbing with the knife. Just rub it. Like that. See, that's all you have to do. Just rub it. It'll get as smooth. We'll take a little bit
of the cadmium yellow, a little white, and then we'll put a
little touch right in here. And, rub that. There, looks like sunlight just zipping right through there. Just like so. But already, see it's beginning to give the impression of a wave. It's that easy. Okay. Take a little phthalo blue, alizarin crimson, proportionally
much more crimson, much more crimson than the blue. All right, just grab a little
white and put in there, so I could see what color I've got. I like that! I like that color. Nice one! Sometimes it just works wonderful. We'll come right in here. We'll put a little indication, maybe a shadow. There, and just rub it in. It's going to mix with that color that's on the canvas
automatically, automatically. (makes wave crashing sound)
This old crasher wave goes right up here, It breaks the horizon. There we go. Just splash it up in the sky. About like that. We don't know where it's going yet. We'll make that decision
in a little while. Take a little phthalo blue, a little bit of white, there. We'll just make a nice blueish color. Maybe a little darker than that. About like that, that's pretty nice. I like that color. All right. There, now we have several
different values we can use. And, we can begin thinking about maybe there's a little dooder
that comes right there. I know, I didn't make any sense yet. Watch, watch, watch. Watch, it'll come. It'll come. (makes water running sound)
Here comes the water coming right down. We could just put all kinds
of little things in there. Just blend them together. This knife will do fantastic things if you just give it a chance. Just rub it. I like to do entire paintings using nothing but the
knife when I'm at home. But that's hard to do on television with the limited time frame that we have. But you could do the entire painting with nothing but the knife. You really can. All right. Take a little bit of the titanium white. Just want to make it look like the water's beginning to fall over. Something about like so. Now then, I'm just using the knife here. I'm just going to touch it, and let that water splash and churn, and crash as it comes over. Just boom! Make little sound
effects when you do this. It really helps. Get's you in the mood. Think about being... Like about a day at the ocean. If you don't live close to the ocean, then just sort of imagine it. Painting is imagination anyway. It's imagination that you can see. There. That easy, you could make an indication of a happy little foam
wave crashing, churning. There it comes. All right, we need something for that to be hitting on that there. Let's take some of our browns, van dyke, dark sienna mixed together. Throw some black in there too. I want it dark. Maybe, yeah. Let's put us a nice rock right here. There it is just a big old happy rock. Got to have something for
all this to splash on. (makes wave crashing sound) There I go making them noise again. I'm sorry. I get carried
away making noises. If you was to record me at home, when I'm painting by myself, people think you're nuts. I sit around all by myself, in a big old empty house, make weird little noises. But they say you know, "You know, that Bob, he's a painter." Painters are sort of strange. So, it's okay. Take a little black, little white, little
brown, mixed altogether. There. Now, I want to come right in here, and I'm still just using the knife. Just going to sort of put the
indication of a stone, here. I have to keep wiping the knife off. Just wipe off the excess paint. Just by rubbing it,
you can begin to create the illusion of all kinds
of things happening here. Painting is nothing more
than games of illusion. That's really all it is. On a flat surface, you
can make it look like there's depth and dimension. That's what it's all about. We'll take a little white, a little touch of the
phthalo blue, not much, and very gently, very gently, just begin bringing these two together. Just churning and fighting, crashing and carrying on, there. There we are. Something about like that. All right. Now, let's find... Here' one. We take a little indian yellow, some white, and just mix them together. Indian yellow is a very bright yellow to go up in here. Maybe right there. We'll put some reflection
right in the water. About like that. Now, if you start in the
brightest area and work out, automatically, it'll pick
up that color underneath, and get darker and
darker, as it works out. A little more color. Lightest area, and then we work outward,
outward, outward. That easy. See, it gets darker and
darker automatically. Then, we'll go across just
like we're making reflections 'cause that's what it is. Reflected color. Already it looks wet. Like that. Now, then. Time to start having some fun, here. Take a little white, a little blue, and maybe firm pressure right along in here. Like that. Firm, firm pressure. There we go. Really get in there and work it. Isn't that a neat way to
make a little seascape? And as I say, if you've had
trouble with seascapes before, this might be the answer to your problem 'cause it's very simple, it works. Putting another little dooder out there. Firm pressure. I want that nice little edge to be there. Then you need to wipe
the knife continually. Get the paint off. There. Right around something like that. A few of these little dooders. We could bring them. See, it's up to you. You make the decisions. You make the decisions where ever you want them to be. All right. Just all kinds of little
things happening here. Pick up a little of that color, bring it down. It creates the way the
water's going to flow. That easy. All right. I get carried away when I
do these 'cause I like them. I like to do these little rascals, and I like to paint with a knife. It's really... As I say, when you're at home you could paint entire paintings using nothing but the knife. Try it! You'll like it. I'm going to take a little
more of the blue and white. Once again, our little roll of paint. I want one more of those little dooders. This right here. Something about like that, so it just goes right on off the canvas. Gives it a little more depth. Put a few little things. Now, we can take our little fan brush and very gently, just grab that and pull it back, right across the water there. See, just pull it back. Just grab that color. That needs to go pretty straight. You don't want your water to look like it's running up side
of a mountain or something. It needs to go fairly straight. All right. But isn't that a super, simple, little way of making a very effective seascape? Think you'll like that one, try it. I'd love to hear from you. If you have time, drop me a line. Send me a photograph of your paintings. My gosh, we get some of the most beautiful photographs people are
doing all over the country. Marvelous, marvelous paintings! I want to brighten that so it stands out. Looks like the water's
coming over a little bit. There, a little bit in there. It's up to you. You decide where all
these little rascals live. We can splash a few little
more things up in here. Don't want to get this too crazy. Up in here, there. All right. As I mentioned, we could
take the script liner brush, a little paint thinner. I'm using white with just a
touch of phthalo blue in it. In here, and there, and there, you could get in here
and put in some details. Just put in all kinds of little waves and things that make your seascape really special, fantastic looking. Put that easy. Just thin the paint
down with paint thinner. Then, it'll slide right over here. There, see. Once again, I think this
is one of the easiest seascapes we've ever come up with. It's a lot of fun to do, and you really can do this one. We'll have a little dooder
that comes right down the wave. Anywhere you want them. There we go. You could put as much detail
in your world as you want, or you can stop right there, right where it was. Take a little of that lavender color, and I just want to highlight right around the edge of that, that little dark line will help set everything off. Even under here, if you put a dark line,
it'll make it project up. Just put a dark line under all
those things right like that. I think we'll take a little red, and we'll sign this one. Going to call it Finished. Hope you've enjoyed this little seascape. It's a lot of fun, and I'd love to see what you're doing. If you do have time, send me a picture. Until next time, from all of us here, I'd like to wish you a happy painting, and God bless my friend.
