hey welcome back certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do another little fantastic painting good tell you what let's have them start off and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and as usual they'll come across the same waters I had them on my palette starting with the white and working around while they're doing that let me tell you what I've already done up here I have my standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas and today I've taken a little contact paper and cut a design out of it and just stuck it on there and on top of that then I put some liquid white and we're all ready to go so I hope you are too tell you what let's get started today I'm gonna start out with a two inch brush I'm gonna go right into the least little amount of Prussian blue this is a very very strong color it doesn't take very much just tap a little bit into the bristles there we go let's go right up here now we'll start right up here we just use our little crisscross strokes you just ants in a heavy little sky so all there is to it just have fun sort of let it happen there this is continually mixing with a liquid white and the color gets lighter and lighter as we work down the canvas to go in for a little variation I'm oh go right into something low blue same old dirty brush and we reach right over here and get the least little touch but they go green so we had phthalo blue and pale green we just is such a fantastic day let's just make a bright shiny little painting though it'll just make you happy there we go just use some of these beautiful little colors a little touch more color there and let's have some water in this painting you know me I'm such a water freak I've put water just about every painting that I do there let's go down and I'll get a little more of the blue then Lord blue little more the green and all I'm doing is just tapping the brush into the color pull out the tiniest little amount of color and then tap the brush there it's all you have to do now maybe the water will live right along in here somewhere so let's just go right across like so I will decide where the water is really at later right now all we're doing is putting a little color on the canvas okay let's wash our brush and we wash our brushes with odorless thinner scrub them off good get all the paint out give them a shake and cover everybody now with a clean dry brush all I'm gonna do here still using little crisscross strokes is sort of blend my sky out you can make this guy's soft as you want it or you can leave it with some action in it so then look dead very lightly go across take out the brush strokes okay now then let's have some fun today let's take we'll use the old fan brush we'll be right into titanium white with a fan brush load a lot of paint into the brush a lot of paint will reach down and be right back out right back there we go get the least little touch of bright red in it these little touch okay let's go up here maybe up here in the sky their lives just a happy little cloud and he just sort of floats around the pier and has fun all day they're just sort of let it play wherever you want it and clouds are free clouds are very free one of the freest things in nature there we go okay this may be right along in there and I'll take a clean dry brush and very gently very gently I'm just gonna blend the base of it out not touching the top yet knock off the excess paint off the brush then I'm gonna grab it and lift it upward in a big circular stroke and then very lightly very lightly just blend it a little bit and not a super way of making a happy little clown god we don't want this cloud to get lonely so let's go right in here hey blue better not a little cloud right here and you can put as many or as few clouds in your world as you want just drop them in there we go maybe one lives right in there I don't know just make a decision drop it in I'll call the excess paint again there I beat this big brush it just removes the paint and well you don't have to go through the entire cleaning procedure blend the base sort of lift it up tease a little bit and then very lightly very lightly just go and that easy you get a sky full of beautiful little clouds will washes first there okay let's build us a let's build this little mountain today I think for that I'm gonna take a little bit of black Van Dyke Brown and a little touch of Prussian blue there we go just sort of mix it like so pull it out as flat as you can get it so go in straight with a knife and cut across and get that little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife okay now they've got to make your first major decision where's your Mountain lift maybe he lives are right there push this paint right into the fabric get tough with it so you got to make all those little noises or it doesn't work right there we go see so let that pull right out through there like so and back to our large brush and I want to grab that and pull it since this is wet you can move the color you can move paint right on the canvas there just sort of let disappear right down here into the mist okay now then let's take some titanium white and dark Sienna going to mix that together but leave it marble like it don't over mix it and without taking cut off once again that little rule of paint and and go right up here no pressure no pressure just touch and let it flow right down the side of the mountain but no pressure just pretend your whisper floating across about them there there we go alright maybe they just let the knife bounce and play you think about where those little peaks and ridges and where the sunlight would bounce through there and sparkle it all up wherever you want it okay now then let's take a little light Prussian blue Russian blue and some Van Dyck Brown maybe a touch more the white there very nice very nice that'll be our shadow color once again we cut off at a little tiny roll of paint there it is let's go right up in here and just touch soon and just follow the angles right down the mountain just like that they're want to keep that side quite dark I want this to really stand out okay and then take a clean dry brush and I have several of each breast good here so I don't have to spend all my time cleaning brushes and here I'm just going to tap China's tap following day and goes into mountain if you come straight across like it it's gonna cut it off like somebody took a big knife and just cut the bottom of it off and we don't want that but now very lightly two hairs and some air lifts that upward upward so it just looks like it's setting right it out there in the mist and then take the fan brush this time I've dipped the fan brush into a small amount of the liquid white liquid white first and then into titanium white only to thin the paint a little now then let's go up here I thought today we'd have some happy little clouds that have floated down here right down into the mountain here right in front of it just floated down maybe they got tired and sad to rest a while sit down here on this mountain take life easy there so all there is to it just letting float right on down there and you put them wherever you want them as many as you want clean dry brush very gently very gently and it will just stir these up a little bit very lightly see the paint we use down here though is very firm very dry and you can paint right over the top of it without it turning to mud be sure you have a very dry paint a lot of times I have people write and tell me that they went to the art store to buy paint and they said oh it doesn't matter what kind of paint you use you can do that be sure the paint is very very dry if not you're going to be angry with me I want this to work for you I'm going back to the same old mountain color here cut off a little roll and maybe there's another mountain that lives here since we're doing a good tall vertical painting today we can have several ranges of Mal gonna say just once again block in your basic little shape this is good because it'll give you practice with a couple layers of mountains there take our big brush grab it in Polish there we go but you can make a layer after layer after layer it's a super super way to make friends with a knife okay go back to our highlight color dark see it in white touch and flow right down the side of the mountain just touch it and flow so obvious to it touchy let it go there okay tell you I don't get the little path that little rascal works so nice sometimes in these smaller areas get my shadow color and let's go there yeah that little knife just sneaks right in there we'll just put a little bit of shadow right along there wherever maybe have that highlight sort of legal and jiggle it there we go just let your imagination be your guide you're only restricted by your imagination just tap once again you want this mysterious base that's the only thing you had to separate setting little soft Mysteria all I'm doing is banging the brush a little bit to knock off the excess color now very lightly just whisper light whisper light in that fantastic that you can create two rows of mountains two ranges of mountains that easy but you can you can you can do anything okay this let's have some fun maybe we'll make some little foothills back here we'll take some a little touch of the phthalo green a little blue a little bit of brown get some more white in there the blue the brown you left to get a brush dirty here there not so much let me clean my knife off here and tell you what let's take let's take it a one-inch brush then we'll go right into some of that color with a run inch brush just load both sides with a little bit of color let's go ahead up here now maybe just take the corner of the brush maybe there's a happy little Foothill it lives right along there see there he is there he is you know he was there didn't you straight down Street now with our big brush I want to create mist so tap that firmly that easy and creates the illusion of mist okay we'll just take the same old brush maybe we need another foot he'll want to add a little bit of alizarin crimson to that no more of the Prussian blue I want darken it each layer of foothills as I get closer to you should get darker and value darkened color there we go see there by this being a little darker now it'll stand out it becomes it's an individual it's different there we go and you can just make a layer after layer after layer in your world wherever you want them and as many as you want there now once again I want to create that illusion of mist at the base so take a big brush and really get tough with it on the bottom down here don't get tough up here but down here just beat the devil at it this is where you take out all your frustrations of hostilities it's also where you need a good strong easel you don't have a good strong easel it's probably just going to just fall over on you you don't want that to happen this particular easel I made myself out of a platform ladder that makes a super super easel good nice strong and you can use it to do a lot of other things my friend Dana had to had to plaster on his house the other day so he just took the easel head off and used his ladder to do some plastering so you came to it has multiple uses I'm mixing up just some blue brown black all the dark colors a little bit of SAP green in there too we need a very dark color very dark color there we go are you going to need a pretty good pile of it okay let me find there's a nice-looking fan brush let's go right into this load the fan brush full of color both sides okay right up here now maybe there's some little trees that lit we back here in the distance notice this color is darker Nina's color is darker so it stands out it wasn't darker it wouldn't look right you ever looked at a painting and maybe you didn't know exactly what was wrong with it but your mind told you something's not right a lot of times is something as simple as the fact that the color does not get progressively darker as it works forward there just lifts up like so well we've made one heck of a mess here and we don't make mistakes though we have happy accidents very soon very soon you learned to work with anything it happens I want a big tree there this son of a gun with us sunshine don't him and he got a lot of water life is good to him so he really got taken strong big old tree man let's take create us our reflection because this is wet you can make this paint slide and move see that easy just grab it and pull it and lightly go across and instant reflections yeah let's take we'll use some yellow some yellow that'll be the green into it and just mix these colors on your brush let's go up in here and let's put the indication absolutely nice shiny little grassy things that are far away I'm just pushing upward with a brush there so obvious - it just make a little Peninsula it'd daryus it's right out there and we guys will take a little touch of the brown and white it's dark sienna and white at indication of a little tree trunk in there a little more the dark green and we can put just a few little highlights on this big everdene here we don't want any highlights back here they're too far away we want him to have a few right there a little liquid white on the knife get us a little of that let's put us a water line right up in here just like so really cut how do you act like you're trying to cut a hole right through the canvases very strong hard a few little ripples here and there and then we have to start making some big decisions so let's have some fun let's go up here we get some black and some pression blue what the heck just black impression boot and let's make a decision maybe in this particular painting right here want some dark color just really get in there wipe it off just maybe right along in there doesn't matter how you put this on you can put it on with a paint roller hmm start a whole new fad just drop it in we need some dark in order to show some light that we're going to put on there let's make let's make a couple of big trees back to our fan brushes it's already dirty maybe their lives in our world a big evergreen right there there he goes there he goes make strong evergreen tree and that indicates by size that he's closer to you he lives right here in the foreground there there we go just wherever you want him to live maybe yeah let's say he has a friend right there there okay I just sort of work back and forth it's always to it so if evergreens live right there in your fan Bray sometimes you have to sort of push a mallet oh okay shoot ed brush is too slow let's get serious here take the 2 inch brush pull it through the paint and one direction one direction load a lot of color into the bristles and maybe right here lives just to have a little push and all we're doing is putting in the background color for the bush we'll come back and we'll put all the beautiful little highlights on right now we're just putting in some nice background color just push that brush bend it just bend it hopefully like so I have it we've planned a fan brush I'm going to dip it into the liquid white and then into titanium white so we have liquid white titanium white the liquid white is only to make it thinner okay let's go up here maybe the water is coming right along here it's just having a good time and oh my gosh flip somebody has pulled the cork out and there it goes see just let it fall and it's lashes down through here and it just wanders on around wherever you want it to go say there push upward to make those little foamy things just let it wander I don't down okay let me get let's me yet I want inch brush I've dip it into the liquid white once again but then the paint then into some SAP green and yellow a lot of pain in the bristles and let's begin putting some beautiful little highlights on some of these bushes and trees here they're back about individual bushes tone just throw this on it random little yellow ocher little Indian yellow here and there maybe just a touch the bright red now we need something for this to stand them let's take Van Dyke Brown and we'll go right there and we'll make a little rock just a little rock for it to stand on it here maybe yep comes right over it here wherever you want it take a touch of that mountain color and we'll add a little highlight there look at that okay I know then I'll just pull that down on the side there a little bit of our water splashing up against the edges back to our one inch brush and get some more SAP green some yellow here now let's put a let's put a happy little Bush here in there maybe some go right down here see let him go right down like it let's go on the other side over here there there lives a nice Bush say think about the individuals though I can't say that enough can't say that enough a little touch of the bright red they're just sparkles it up makes it really shine maybe right here their pay you what let's do hmm we need something for this side to stay a little too back to my van Dijk Braille and let's come right along in here it will put a happy little stone that is here see just pull down I can look at their King a little bit of the highlight color just pull it across angles are very important when you doing this angles angles always look at you angles here hold a little touch of it down want this to stay dark underneath though there we go now back to our fan brush we can splash a little bit of water above there that cleans up the bottom of that brings it all together makes it very heavy look nice tell you what I won't go into a little bit of a titanium white the least little touch of phthalo blue let's get crazy today just a little bit of the phthalo blue maybe there's a little blue bush it lives right there once in a while something like it really sparkles your painting up okay then we can come right on back down in here see their push it's everything right back into the distance now take a touch of brown and white little indication here in there uh-huh up a tree trunk a little bit of highlight don't want too much bike so scratching a few little sticks and twigs have it let's have some fun let's bring the camera right up here I'm going to take the contact paper off now pull that array down and look at that getting that fantastic adit watch here the old clock of the wall tell me it's about time to get out of here but I want to show you how you can bring this right out of this painting look here see there that does everything just protrude right out I love these shapes made with the contact paper and some of the fantastic effects you can get with it look at there a few highlights on it just like so what do you think I think we have a finished painting I really hope you've enjoyed this give it a try you can make all kinds of different shapes once again you're only limited by your imagination and from all of us here happy painting and God bless Oh Oh you
