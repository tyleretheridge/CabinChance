hello I'm certainly glad you could join me today you got your paints out ready to do a fantastic painting one let's get started tell you what let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me while they're doing that let's go on up here and let me show you what I've already done have our standard Oh 18 by 24 inch canvas this is a double primed canvas pre-stretched and on this canvas I've completely covered it with a thin even coat of the liquid white which makes it wet and slick it it's all ready to go so let's go to tell you why let's have some fun today let's do a little winter scene so I'll start out with a touch of alizarin crimson just to touch it we'll work it into the two inch brush just by tapping it just tap it just like so just go right up here now when I paint winter scenes I like to have a little bit of warmth and it bothers me I don't like winter scenes that are so cold that you you have to put a coat on top to feel comfortable when you look at them so I like to put a touch of warmth in my winter scene but when you paint yours you pay on me any way that you want them and your way everybody's different and everybody sees nature different ways so you paint it the way that makes you happy and while I have that on a brush maybe just throw a little bit right down in here I'm gonna have some snow I think down in it yeah we'll put snow down a little that color maybe will reflect right into the snow so just just lady in now then without even cleaning the brush let's go into a little bit of Prussian blue now Prussian blue is so strong it's very strong you don't even have to clean the brush because it'll just absolutely eat up the alizarin crimson is left on there I load a little bit of that in there let's go right up in here and now then let's just sort of let the brush just and dance a little color in here just sort of like little X's but just let it just just sort of dance and play just have fun leave little openings in your sky little holes in the sky we'll come back and we'll put the indication of some little soft clouds here and there they're a little bit more of the blue see how easy that is just sort of let your imagination go and just just drop these things right in wherever you want and be careful right in here because this blue is so strong it'll eat up your little pinkish color it'll eat it up in in a heartbeat now just able to bear that same color down here what's going to be slow you know that's what we really don't care right now and we can wash your brush we wash your brush and it'll odorless thinner shake off the excess and this is a fun part and just meet the devil out of it okay now with our clean dry brush go right on back up here and just start blending the sky a little bit there I've probably painted in excess of over twenty thirty thousand paintings and I still get a kick out of cleaning the brush of course they don't hear them they have to clean the studio up there we go now what I'm doing is just lightly blending here I don't want to over blend I don't want to lose little spots like this in the sky those are very pretty and they give your sky character especially if you're doing a winter scene now just beat the excess paint off that brush I'm go right into some titanium white and just pull that brush right through the white just load it full look at all the color a lot of paint in the brush getting this cup here now I just want indications a little clouds a day so I'm not gonna overdo this just just sorta put them here just want little indications this is just sort of a misty little sky who you know it's cold no it's cold it has to be I lived in Alaska for a dozen years or so when you saw us guy like this you'd be getting the whole Parker out any mukluks yes some little things happening here just blend them together just like so yeah I have several of each brush going so take a clean dry 2 inch brush and I'm just gonna mix this up and blend it a little bit I don't want to blend too much or it'll go away and leave you just go and leave you all by yourself there okay and we can sort of fluff it a little like so very lightly very lightly just barely caressing the canvas make some long strokes to blend it all together and that easy that easy you have a fantastical sky let's put a bunch of evergreens in this painting evergreens are a lot of fun to paint and they're they're quite easy so let's take let's take we use Prussian blue put some midnight black in there and some Van Dyck Brown put some lives in crimson whatever whatever looking for a dark color now gonna pick up some white there because we put the Prussian blue in there and it's so strong this color will be predominantly blue maybe I'll add a touch more of the crimson to it there we go still predominantly blue okay anybody mix up a pretty good pile of paint let me clean the knife off and grab the old fan I tell you what let me show you an easy way to do a lot of trees take the old two inch brush and we'll just pull it right through a little bit of color here at it the big thing here is just to apply some color to the canvas so we'll just put this put some color wherever once again I don't want to lose all that pink most of its going to go away but I want to say just enough to keep it warm there oh we do it is looking for paint on the canvas could really care less what's happening just happy do this tapping okay now that let me grab move fan brush and we'll go right into this color we laid there just load it full a lot of paint see there a lot of paint both sides let's go ahead again now then begin picking out individual trees take the corner of the brush just work back and forth back and forth back and forth and see down here we don't care it'll all just sort of come together and it saves you a lot of time it's easier than painting each tree individually and you can make shoot you can make a forest back here we could also have made these trees with one-inch brush two-inch brush palette knife pallet knife makes beautiful trees up there there we go see already we got out got the beginnings of a little forest little squirrel has to have a place to live and he comes up here grabs you pinecone gotta take care of the little creatures there we go hmm let's just take these all the way across wherever they say squirrels got to have a place to live I call squirrels tree urchins as so to my little name for our make up names for all my little friends rally if I have hundreds and hundreds of birds that come every day I gotta spend all my money buying birdseed and putting out for and in return they let me watch him sometimes I get to get to raise one or two little ones in fact I think the last series we showed one of the little birds we were raising maybe a little later on in this series will show let's show that little bird make a little later I'll show you how show you what happened to it we had so many letters and cards asking what happens a little bird we showed oh I'll get Sally to put him up on the screen we'll look at him later okay that all it is some trees there we go that easy now then I want to create the illusion of a little bit of mist out here so I'll just take a clean brush just tap this a little bit just a little just a little there lift upward just lift it up right up it up bring up with a bridge okay and then I want to put another layer trees that look like they're closer to you so I'll show you how to do that same color probably there's no white in this color this is just pure color and we can do the same thing the same old dark color but don't kill all that mist you work so hard to put it in there don't kill it see you can't let just puttin just puttin this is just base color we really could cure less same as we did back here this is just a base color they're black and blue a little brown little touch of alizarin crimson all together here so yeah this will save you a tremendous amount of time and I'm a lazy painter I always look for easy ways to paint there we go had it wash that brush off I'll get the light color out of it just wash it off and then all we do is just wipe that brush against the paper towel and then we go right into our dark color that's blue black grab some Brown touch of alizarin crimson load that brush full of paint okay have it right along in here that's brain some trees that are darker and therefore they look like they're closer to you hey you don't have to paint all this bottom really will save you a lot of time when you have a multitude of trees together like this if you just do in one tree at a time you wouldn't want to we wouldn't want to paint this way I thought today would do a bunch of trees thought you'd like that as he heads pushing those lighter ones back did you know you could push a whole forest back that easy you can you can do anything anything at least on this piece of canvas you can there we go maybe let's put two or three tops in like that and then just come along and give him some little arms wherever you want that easy okay baby oh there's a nice one he got a little more sunlight a little lazy little stronger his grows right on up there there's one there's one there's one whatever you want to make big decisions and drop them in this piece of canvas you're you had a creator you have absolute power absolutely you can make any kind of world that you want here any kind of world that you want that's part of that huh it'll it'll plug that's part of the joy of painting is the fact that you can create your own world and painting painting should make you happy it doesn't make you happier you're doing the wrong thing okay maybe another one room in both areas now if you do if you do this painting along with me by the time you're finished you will be an expert at making evergreen trees no doubt you have those down you'll never never again have a problem making evergreen trees now then I'm just going to take a clean knife nothing on it and just here in there just sort of pull through and it'll make the indication I'm cutting right through the paint it'll just make it look like tree trunks here there we don't want a lot of detail that makes it look like little tree trunks and loose arm here and there can you see the amount of distance between these but just by varying the color it's exactly the same color except back here there's a little white in it same color but it helps create that illusion of distance and it's that's so important when you're doing paintings distance and paintings are what make it makes a difference between painting is just so-so and a painting that when you look at it it does wonderful things to you get excited from watching and that's what it is it's this distance depth in a painting there we go okay now we said we were going to have some snow in this one so let's take the old two-inch brush just load it full of white paint this is just straight oh titanium white a lot of paint in the brush let out of paint okay now let's just sort of reach right up in here and grab some of this you want to pick up some of this color I'm trying to pick up the bottom of these trees because that's going to end up being my shadows it's gonna create shadows under these trees and it'll happen automatically you don't have to worry about it it just it happens there we go and that's super and it's so easy and you can change the angles and make all different planes in the painting and by planes like see how this one overlaps that one just just like it just grab that bottom and pull it pull it hard get tough with it this is where you take out all your frustrations just grab it and pull look at there and you can sneak back in there and grab little pieces pull and you can create as many or as few shadows as you want if you want the indication of a few little little happy grassy areas coming out of there you can just lift upward give a little upward pull it makes all kinds of little things and it sort of cleans up your edges there okay shoot what we get that only let's just think we'll have all this snow so we can just add white here all over and I'm leaving some of these little Pink's blues that we put in there now let's kill all of those I'm just adding a little white hearing there and letting some of that show through now the paint that we're applying is extremely thick very very thick and that way we can put layers of thinner paint right over the top of that without creating any problems if all the layers of paint are the same thickness than when you try to put one layer on top of another you're gonna be a mud mixer then you're gonna be mad at so don't want that to happen take what let's do that's let's build us a little cabin out here shoot his cold out here you need a place to live now one of the easiest ways to make a cabin here is to take your knife decide basically where you want it and scrape out an initial shape oh there goes our tree just but you can just grab it and scrape it out this does several things most important it removes the excess paint off the canvas it makes your next layer much easier to stick see yeah but it also allows you to lay out your cab and get the perspective the way you want it and you're not committed you're not committed at this point so you can't make a mistake here if something goes wrong you just drop the trees right back in do it again as you know we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents there it is maybe tell you I must do maybe in this cabin let's put a chimney so same thing take and just scrape in the basic sheet so you know about where that chimney is gonna be it will have it see up and over so it looks square come down sort of remember that if you cover it up you remember where it's at and then this roofs going to come down we might even even put a porch on this one we have enough time we'll drop foot in start off with titanium white pull it out very flat cut across and we get our little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife at a decision time so here let us start begin laying snow right out here in the roof angles are very important very important just pull that rascal down yeah out here if you want make your sage nice and sharp you come along that way see and come back and smooth it out sneaky huh and it just moves it out like so go and that's part of our roof I'm going to go into a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown get a little roll of paint and we'll do this back Eve here and for that we just want to pull it over like that now we'll take a mixture of dark sienna and Van Dyck Brown and just sort of mix it a little bit not much just don't over mix it cut off a little bit once again that roll of paint is so important now then let's take that and just begin pulling down remember we have a chimney in here we're going to put a chimney in this one remember that so you can sort of save a little spot there for your chimney we don't want this old guy that lives out here to freeze to death same color so there's two it that gives us a basic shape now then I'm gonna take some white a little bit of the titanium white touch of the dark Sienna in it and maybe the least least little touch a bright red dark Sienna touch of bright red that's so strong and white a little more darks and I want that darker see you make the decision however you want it there leave your paint like this don't over mix it get a little roll of paint and all those colors are right there in that roll this clip here now then you can touch no pressure no pressure no pressure pull down pull down let it break let let them holes there they'll give the illusion of aged looks old like me yeah see there now this on the other side of this little cabin I want to be much darker much darker so same color I just added Brown to it see here same color it is much darker so there's a distinct difference the steam difference Wow take some brown let's put a little chimney up here we come right up in here and it came down like so see slight angle thank you right on the cross I tell you what I'm gonna get my little knife a little knife is so good for these little places and we'll go right in here and don't this one sort of go upward upward so it gives the illusion that this chimney is square little bit right down through there because most of that chimneys inside the house we won't see it I'll take some bright red some bright red and a little bit of Van Dyck Brown and we'll mix it together maybe these are bricks so easy way to just make indications just touch and just sort of let the knife the bounce as you work down look up up up up now if you don't make that little noise it won't work get out of here that little noise good I'd have it and maybe just a few over here but show the difference in angle like wait'll it'll make it square and tell you what right on the top up here maybe there's a little snow laying up here there we go just a touch of snow clean off my knife and talking about speaking of a touch of snow on this side of the roof over here we need a little bit of snow on that side of the roof now said we might put a porch on this one so I think we're doing all right for time let's do it take some a little bit of brown and just sort of come right out here I'm not using much Brown just a little because I want a little bit of to show through right into the flight and porch right out like that see there and it easy and easy now we need a floor so same thing under here bring it out roughly the same angle likes a little touch of highlight would sneak under here not a whole bunch cuz this can be pretty dark under there pretty dark and then we'll give it a little distance that easy well you know what yeah we need something to hold this porch up so let's just put a rail or two in here just like so see there that's easy and easy got a little rail and since our lights coming from this direction put a little light on the house and we can put the indication of a board or two here just using a dark color that simple if you wanted a window you just scrape in a couple windows isn't that easy no you could do that now then I'm gonna do something a little different I'm going to liquid clear liquid clear and then right in to a titanium white I use a liquid clear to thin the paint just a touch I I must go right up here and let's begin adding all kinds of little things that's liquid clear makes the paint flow because it's thinner now flows right over there you can just really bring these things out of lost yeah and when this dries the areas that you put this clear in will shine they'll have a they'll have a luster to them it's very nice very nice maybe right up in here let's do this maybe there's a little hang right here a little brown and white maybe we'll pull that out make a little bump bump right there maybe at one time maybe they had a little snow fence up there you just take a little brown here just sort of adds to the painting put a little fancy sort of laying over a little white on the knife and just weakly just do little to do and put some little wires on their back that take your fan brush and grab some of those create a very nice little effect now then tell your heart maybe right here right here there's a little bush it lives right here we just pop email just popping out we don't want him to get left out so we'll put one right over here and all I'm doing is pushing upward with a fan brush push very firmly push upward like so then our brush that has the white on it and touches the clear a liquid clear you can grab that and pull it once again you allow that dark color to become part of the shadows it's very desirable don't fight it don't find it but it happened there we go look at that in its super now you know me I'm a tree nut I like trees let's take the old fan brush and go right in to Van Dyck Brown a lot of it yep I'm gonna have a happy tree hmm lives right there I don't want him to be lonely or giving will give a friend just like so and then we can take our liner brush go into some brown and you just drop on a few little lamps have then this with thinner see here you can put on a few little domes wherever you want to drop it as many or as few as you want into your world hmm don't take the knife grab a little the white tell you what let's make these bridge trees just by pulling around you can create a happy little bird street just give it a little round pull just flips it and I think with that we have not ever finished painting I hope you've enjoyed this one I think it'll teach you a lot show you how to do a beautiful little winter scene and I'm gonna call this painting complete from all of us here happy painting and god bless
