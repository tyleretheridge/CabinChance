- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. Thought today we'd just do
a fantastic little painting. I hope you have your paints set up and you're all ready to join us. So I'll tell you what. Let's start out and run all
the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. While they're doing let me
show you what I've got done. Got my standard old
pre-stretched canvas up here and it's been covered
with a thin, even coat of the liquid white so
it's all ready to go. So I'll tell you what, let's go. Today, let's just have some fun. Let's just do a little painting that'll sorta make you happy. It's enjoyable. I want to start out with a
little touch of the phthalo blue on the two inch brush. Don't need a great deal of paint. And let's go right up in here today and let's just have some fun. Let's just dom something like this. There. Sometimes it's fun just to
let your imagination go crazy and just enjoy playing with color and just having a good time. A little phthalo blue, just phthalo blue. And this mixing with the liquid
white that's on the canvas and automatically you get
all this nice blending. Now then, I'll tell you what, let's add a little bit
of the Prussian blue. Now, Prussian blue is much
darker and much stronger and I'm gonna go right around the edge with a little bit of the Prussian blue. Something like so. And we're still just using
little criss-cross strokes. I'll put some on the
other side over here too, don't want it left out. There. About like so. Okay. That's looking pretty neat already. Now then, maybe I'll take, I'll tell you what, let's
use a little Prussian blue and I'll add a little
midnight black to it. We'll make a very dark blue. Black and blue. Or blue and
black, whichever you prefer. Alright, we'll come right up here and we'll just put in
a little of that very, very dark color. Okay. Now then, take that same
color and go to the other side and put a little over here. Just like so. And we're still using
little criss-cross strokes. It really makes blending a lot easier if you use those little
criss-cross strokes rather than just drawing
big circles like that. Okay. Now, the fun part. This is the fun part.
We'll wash our brush. Shake off the excess (chuckles) and just beat the devil out of it. There we are. Let's take a
little bit of the titanium white right on the two inch brush. And then we'll move right back up in here and decide where the
lightest part of the sky is. And we'll just begin blending outward. This is just straight titanium white and this is to put a little
bright spot in our sky. Just let it blend outward here. And you can do this several times to achieve a desired
lightness if you want to. There we are. And just keep blending outward. This is a nice way of making
a very effective little sky. Okay, just keep working outward. But try not to take the
dirty color from over here and put it back in the center. Stay out of the center
once your brush is dirty. If you want to back in the center and work then I would suggest you clean
the brush and start fresh. Just really get in here and scrub it off. (beats brush) (chuckles) Besides, that is fun just to be the brush a little bit. There we are. Okay, that's sort of a
wow-looking sky already. Okay, I'll tell what let's do. Let's mix up a nice lavender, we'll use a little phthalo blue and Alizarin crimson,
proportionally much, much more of the crimson than blue. I want this to be sort
of to the reddish side. And it's hard to tell, let's
put a little white in there and see what we have. I want a nice light lavender color. Maybe we need a little more white. Oh, that's getting nice now. That's getting nice now. And just mix it back and
forth between the crimsons and blues and white 'til you
get a color that you want. And I think something like that's about what we're looking for. I'm gonna wipe off the old knife here. Maybe we'll have a fan
brush today. What the heck! Let's go right in here, get a touch more of the crimson on there. Oh yeah, there. Better load both sides full
of color. Full of color. And let's go right up and
make some big decisions. Maybe in our world
there's some little things that live right in here. We're just taking the fan brush and sort of tapping downward. That's all we're doing basically here. Se? Just tap downward. Maybe we'll allow it to come
right down in here somewhere. Wherever. Wherever. Okay, maybe it comes right on up, just make some decisions. Look at your painting and
decide where you think things should live and drop them in. There. Now maybe in there there's
a few trees that we can see a lot more detail on. We'll just use the corner of the brush and work it back and forth. There they are. There they are. They live here right in your brush. All you gotta do is just
sorta shake 'em out. Just scare 'em out. Back and forth. We'll even make this one a big ol' tree. There. And we're just looking
for some basic shapes. Just a few here and there. Shoot, I'll tell you
what, that was so nice let's put some on the other side too. Maybe I'll have one over here. We'll have a big one right there. Corner of the brush, as you
work down that little tree push harder and harder so
the bristles downward today. Sometime we make them bend
upward, sometime downward just sort of depending on how
you feel, what your mood is or how the trees are where you live. Or how the trees are in the
area that you want to show on your painting. Just a few more of these little devils. Okay, give him a little friend there. Just a little one right
there. And maybe another one. There. Wherever you think they should be. Okay. Maybe a little in there. Wherever. Okay, now we'll grab
the old two inch brush. Be sure it's dry. And I want to create the illusion of mist down at the base of this. So take the top corner of the brush and firmly tap. Just firmly tap, that's
all we're doing there. There. And with that you can create the illusion of all kinds of little
soft areas in there. Very soft and very misty. And we'll just let that go
right on over to this side and just keep on misting. There. You can probably hear how loud I'm hitting or how hard I'm hitting. (chuckles) It's hard to
hear how loud I'm hitting. And very lightly we'll
lift upward, very gently. Very gently, just barely,
barely touching the canvas. Shoot, I'll tell you what,
while we have that old color going I'm just gonna add a
little bit more to my brush, maybe there's a nice tree
that lives right here. And I'm just using top
corner of the brush, I just want to create
the indication of some nice little things that live back in here. See, they almost are the
same color as the sky. I don't want them to be real distinct. I want them to be soft, just little gentle things
that live back here. There. Got a nice tree going there. A little bit darker toward
the base so it shows up. But this is a way of
creating several layers of little background trees
and bushes and all that just with a two inch brush
and just with tapping. Okay. Maybe it comes right on down here, I don't know, wherever you want it. Wherever you think it should be. Maybe a bit more. Okay. Now then, I'm gonna take
the old script liner brush. number two script liner brush. Little paint thinner on it
and we want to thin this paint 'til it's literally like ink
or water but very, very thin. Very thin, look there. And then turn the bristles
as you take 'em out. That'll bring it to a nice sharp point. There, you can see how sharp it is. Maybe there's a few
little sticks and twigs that you can see back here. Just a few wherever you
think they should be. There. These little devils are
always back here in the trees and stuff so just put in a
few wherever you want 'em. Wherever. Okay. A few over here too, we don't
want this side left out. Now then, I'll tell you what, we'll just keep on using that same color. It's just basically
lavender, Alizarin crimson and phthalo blue and
we'll come right in here and begin just adding all
kinds of little things. But look at all the different
layers that we've created. That's what will help create
that illusion of depth and distance in your painting. Just layer after layer after layer. I'm gonna add a little of
the midnight black to that, I want it to get very dark down in here. Alright. Okay. Now, just take that single
brush, I guess it's alright, we'll just go right
into a little bit of the cad yellow, a little yellow ochre and all I'm doing is tapping
with the top bristles. You can see it very well
there, that's a nice closeup. See that? Just tap it over the top corner. Alright. Now then, with that we
can come back in here and just using that top
corner you can begin shaping all kinds of little individual bushes and trees that live in here. There. And we can vary the colors back and forth between the yellow ochre,
Indian yellow, bright red, just vary 'em, let 'em just
sorta work back and forth and change 'em to however
it makes ya happy. But do one little bush at a time. Don't get too greedy. Sometimes it starts working well and you get a little
carried away and want to do 18 bushes at once. Just work on one at a time. Give each one of them a name if necessary. Whatever it takes. Just make 'em individuals. There. See, layer after layer after layer. That really is what creates
that illusion of depth and I know you hear me
say that over and over but I think that's very
important in a painting. There we go. And way back here maybe just
some tiny little indications. Not much. Not much. Not much back here. Just a few little things
that hide back in there. Then take the knife and scrape through, make a few little sticks
and twigs that look white because the canvas is showing through. There. Alright. Now shoot, I'll tell you what, let's put a little barn in
here today or a big building. Maybe it lives right in here. So take the knife and just
scrape out a basic shape, oh, about like that. I don't know. Whatever you want. Maybe it's got a little shed on it even. While scraping out this basic shape let me grab a little Van Dyke brown. It will do two things. It removes excess paint,
which is most important, but the other thing it
does is it allows you to sorta lay out your whole perspective and your whole building and everything without really being committed. There. 'Kay. So I said we'd have a little shed out here so we'll just put a
little roof, pull down, and all we're doing right now
is just blocking in color. That's all were doing.
Just blocking in color. Like so. There. A little bit on this side. (chuckles) Wish it was that
easy to actually build a barn. This certainly makes it easier. My father was a carpenter so I've spent a lot my life building things. I know how difficult it is
to actually make a barn. That's why I said I wished
it was this easy to do. Now then, let's take a little
white, a little dark sienna, a little Van Dyke brown, we'll just mix them together like so. Maybe even the least little
touch of blue into it and they'll grey it,
that'll give it a grey tone. Pull across, get our little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife. Then you can come back
in here and no pressure. No pressure. Just like putting snow on the mountains. Barely touch. Barely, barely touch. Want to make this look
like old, weathered wood. Old, weathered wood. Like
me, it's had a hard life. There we go. Little bit over in here. Zoom. Just barely touch, though.
Barely, barely touch. And then we'll take a little
more of the Van Dyke brown and make it much darker
because on the other side not much light's gonna hit
so you need to have that quite a bit darker. See in comparison how dark that is? With our little roll of paint still come right in here, decide
where the roof line is just enough so it barely, barely shows up. That's all we're looking for. There would not be much light striking this side of the building. Not much light. There. And right along the
edge here maybe I'll put up a nice distinct line so it shows that there's
a difference there. Let's take a little bit
more of the Van Dyke brown and I'm gonna turn this
into an old slab building, with other words, made with boards and to do that we'll just the knife, little bit of Van Dyke brown
on it and create the illusion of a lot of little boards in here. Something like so. Now you can smooth that
by taking a two inch brush and barely touching, barely. Just graze it. (exhales softly) Now, for our roof. What are we going to, let's just take midnight
black on the roof. Midnight black like that. Get our little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife again and let's just let it
bounce along here and play. Just touch it. Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. Gotta make that little noise though. That's all there is to
it. Just let it bounce. Let the knife touch. The canvas will pull off what it wants, give you back what's left. There we are. That easy. Now we'll take the small
edge on the other side and I want to make the
indication of little shingles showing on the other side. But by using the small edge
there'll be sorta jaggedy. There. It'll look like you're looking at the edge of little doers there. Okay, right here, excuse my arm a second. Make that line a little darker
where they come together. There. Maybe we'll make
a little doer there. That'll make it a little more distinct. Now we need a door there. This is an old barn, gotta
have a place for the cow to go. We'll just take a knife and go swoosh. How's that? Instant door. We'll take a small edge, go up here. We'll put a little place
for the hay to go up. Cut around there. There we are. Shoot, we got a pretty good
looking old barn there. What the heck. Let's just keep going here. We'll use that lavender and
black and a little brown here and there. Maybe... maybe, yeah, right there. And I'm still just using
the top corner of the brush. Maybe I'll put just a
little tree right there. Something like so. Alright. Comes right on down. I don't know. Wherever you want it. Something like so. Maybe it comes right in front of the barn. We go to all that work to build a barn and then we'll tear it
up but that's alright. That's alright. Now we have several layers of color here. There. Yeah, I got a bunch of brushes going here so I'll grab another one. We'll take a little bit of
sap green, a little yellow, yellow ochre, just tap a little color right onto the bristles. A little bit of red. There we are. Let's go right up here. Now we can just begin adding on some little highlights onto some of these. Did you ever think you
could just take the top of a great, big old
brush and make all these beautiful little trees? You really can. You can. There we are. Maybe a little red and yellow right here, make a nice orange color. Put some color in this rascal. You know, in some of the
past shows in this series, especially, I've enjoyed
showing you some of my little creatures. I want to show you one more today. We got just a second. I'm just going to be doing
this while you're watching but this is one my little squirrels and they bring so much
pleasure into my life. My mother and I enjoy these.
She plays with them too. She probably wouldn't admit that but she has about as much
fun with them as I do. And they love to get
in your pocket and hide and that's where, if you'd let them, they'd spend most of their time. They're just hiding right
there in your pocket. So we call them pocket squirrels. Aren't those cute little devils though? These are just babies, they're just beginning to
get fur from their baby fuzz. There. Now then. See? He had to hid his
head there a little bit. Probably even fell asleep. But sometimes in my little
pocket there all day and I just walk around the house, forget they're in there
and they go to sleep and take life easy. They really are a lot of fun. There we go. Hope you enjoy seeing them. Just taking a little
titaninium white here on the old liner brush and putting
in a little tree trunk or two. Now then, I'll just find a knife. I'll take a little bit
more of the Van Dyke brown and let's come right along
in here and let's put some dirt under here. There. Looks like the weeds have growed up and just about covered up the old barn. Touch of highlight, don't want
a great deal, just a touch. I'll tell you what, maybe let's do this. Maybe... maybe there was a big
old ditch right there. Big old ditch. Or a ravine or whatever
you want to call it. There. Just using Van Dyke brown. Allow a little bit of that
color that you put on the top to grab the knife and come down. You don't need much color
here. Very, very little color. Alright. Now then, let's go back to our brush that's got the highlight color on it. The little greens and all that. Let's just come right in
here and begin putting in shapes of all kind of bushes and stuff. Bushes. There they are. But just using the top
corner. That's all we need. Okay, I'm gonna go back to my brush that has the dark color on it. We'll just put a few
bushes here on this side of that ditch or ravine or
whatever you want to call it. Put a little dark color in there so the highlights will show. You know what? We gotta have a way to
get in there, don't we? Let's take some brown. Maybe there's a little path
that comes right across here. Maybe it goes back in the woods somewhere. There. We'll just use some brown and lay it in like so. And then I'll take a
little brown and white, that stark sienna and white and a little touch of yellow ochre in it. Zoom. There. Like it come right around. Zoom. Gotta have a little place to walk that goes right on back here. Okay. We'll have some little bushes
that live right down in here and come right up over the
top of that a little bit. Little bright red, Indian yellow. Look at there. I like little paintings like
this because it teaches you to use just one big brush. Basically, the only brush we've used here is a great, big old two inch brush. And, and, and... a little bit of dark color right here to push this side back. Some highlights on him. Doop, doop, doop. Little bit of red, want that to stand. Ooh, that's nice. Something growing right here
in front of the old path. We'd have to have... if we was gonna cross this ravine here, we would need to have
maybe something up here to keep everybody from
falling off so we'll put a little doer like that. A few highlights on it,
some brown and white. Come back, let's have a rail across here. Pew. See? 'Cause I'd fall off in there. There we go. A little something for you
to hold on to when you go by. There we are. And then our little bushes
that are growing right here. Scratch in a few sticks and
twigs, all those little things. Now, let's have some fun.
We got a second left here. I'm gonna take Van Dyke brown, all on the fan brush, a
little dark sienna too, what the heck, just mix
them right up in there. Right up. Maybe we have... Yep, you know me. Big tree lives right there. He's got a friend right there. Like so. Just make him nice and dark. Take our liner brush. Mix a little bit of Van Dyke brown with paint thinner 'til
it's very thin, like ink. Okay, let's go up here. Maybe (groans) let it wiggle and jiggle,
gotta make those little noises. And we'll put in a few
little limbs on these trees. In the back you can see a few little trees that are living in there. Put just some nice hanging
down branches on here. There. The other old tree needs
some too. There we go. But the paint should be very thin. If you have trouble making it flow then just add a little
paint thinner to it. And we're gonna put a few leaves on here so we're not too worried about it. Okay, grab another little fan brush. I have several of them going. We'll take some of that black
and brown mixed together and right in here in our world maybe there's some, there we are, just a few little things that
live out here on this tree. Like so. Just push upward with the brush. It'll create that illusion
of all kind of little leaves and stuff out here. There. Wherever you think they should be is exactly where they should be. Alright. I'm gonna take, without
even cleaning the brush, a little touch of yellow ochre on there and it'll mix with that
and turn sorta greenish. And just push up a little
highlight on these. Doesn't take much. Want
it to stay quite dark. Well, the old clock on the wall tells me it's about time to call it a day. I really hope you've enjoyed this one. It's a very nice little painting. It'll show you how to use
a limited number of pieces of equipment and make a
super paint for yourself. From all of us, happy painting and God bless, my friend. (soothing music)
