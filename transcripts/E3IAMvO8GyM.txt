I'm glad you could join me today today I think we'll really do a fantastic little painting that'll it'll bring a lot of good thoughts and write to your heart here so I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white it's wet slick ready to go and we'll have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and we'll get started I'm going to take right off today I'm gonna get right in here to sum this midnight black a little bit of phthalo blue and I'm just gonna mix these on the brush just tap them right into your brush all right let's go up here now I want to just just sort of dance in a little little sky little happy sky use little Criss crosses just let it bounce around and play leave some holes in this guy don't don't kill it off kill it all that's little things just shine through like so just have fun but enjoy there we go now I got this brush dirty I'm gonna go right into a small amount of phthalo green add it right onto the same old dirty brush and load it the same way just tap okay let's put in what will eventually be water pull from the outside in from outside in see over here pull from this direction I'm gonna leave a little area open here I want it to look like a sheen of light coming across the water when this painting is finished there we go just right across okay now let me wash this brush a little over this paint thinner scrub it off give it a little shake and is beat the devil out of it okay now put a clean brush I'm going up in here I'm just gonna blend this guy together a little bit I don't want to blend it so much that I kill all the little actions in it I want to keep some of those in there yeah over blended it just turned into a flat old dead blue sky there we go let's blend it right on down and for the park there's gonna be water very lightly go across that light area will remain right there who where you put it see already it looks like a light shining across here and you hadn't done a thing this is really the lazy man's way to paint that's why I like it so much already you clean up brush one more time shake it off these cameramen hate me alright right into some titanium white a little bit of the rib there we go pull that brush in one direction load a lot of paint into the bristles let's go up here now I want to put a happy little cloud and I'm just gonna take this brush you just dance it a room let it have fun you have areas in the sky where the paint's thick areas where it's very thin areas where there's absolutely no paint keep it moving keep it moving keep it moving otherwise if you stay in one place it'll look like hmm look like a big cotton ball laying up there in the sky that's not what we're looking for we're looking for happy little clouds it just float around and have fun then we'll take a clean dry brush same brush very gently blend the bottom of this out this just blend it Jenna splendid I'm not touching this top area at all just the bottom sorta mix it up mix it up that's a good way of thinking of it just mix it just like you get beaten up a cake batter here and just mixed stuff okay that just takes off the excess pain then I'm gonna fluff it and grab it lift it fluff it drag out all those little stringy things let them happen hmm when all these little things happen don't worry about them because when you blend this guy they'll all go away look here it just brings the fall together it's one of the simplest nicest easiest ways I'm making a beautiful little sky has all kinds of happy with clouds floating in it okay and then think today we'll let's do let's do it almighty Mountain I'll take a little bit of this blue and black add a little white to it so it makes sort of a blue grey color there we go why can't cut off a little bit all right up here I'm gonna have a little hill as far away so all you do drunk in a basic shape take a dirty brush I'm gonna grab it doesn't matter for brushes dirty or clean and just by using brush strokes I'm gonna put the indication of highlights and shadows in this I want this to be very soft very quiet far far away look at there you can blend over the entire thing very light very light it looks like he's little Topman right up in the clouds there and then maybe in front of that one maybe there's a big strong cloud our big strong mountain I mean so let's go back we use some black little touch it move a little Van Dyke Brown in there too let's just mix that pull it out cut across it get that little roll of paint right out on the edge okay now I've decide where your mountain lives may be yep lives right there with this dark color he certainly does now he comes down like that and all you're looking for here is a very basic shape we're not looking for a lot of detail you push get mean with it get tough with it this will you take out all your hostilities I really push that paint right into the fabric canvas is tough I make tents out of it they're ready push it okay now we'll take a big brush and we pull that down just gently just like we did the one in the background this removes excess paint makes the next layer of paint stick much easier less paint you have on this part that easier you'll find it maybe I hear what just happened a bit just let it disappear look at that sort of floats down the sky right now and that gives you a basic shape if you don't like your shape if you're not happy with it when you get to that point you can change it this is your world and the old brush we're in business all right now let's put some happy little things up here I'm going to go into a little bit of the dark sienna and the brown little why just mix it all together I'm gonna put of the bright red in there - what the heck we'll just have fun they will make a happy mountain a little more of the white there cut across it small roll of paint okay let's go up here decide which peak is the father's two way in my mind it's this one tinies tinies a little bit of paint just a tiny bit just like so see there Tiny's a little bit of paint now for shadow cover Oh take a little Y blue some black and mix me up the shadow color here put a little brown in that to give it sort of a bluish gray and you can there tone it to whatever degree you want it okay cut across let's go right up here I'm gonna layin just a little indication of shadow right in there just like so now I want that to be farther back so very lightly take this brush give it a little tap and then very lightly very lightly barely barely caressing the canvas follow the angles there we go just let this disappear try it off into nothing that's far far away okay now then yeah add a little bit more Brown to the same color and sometimes a little yellow ochre doesn't wonders but don't overmix II leave it leave it like that cut off a little hunk yeah we can start playing in here see by not over mixing all these colors happen automatically beautiful little things if you tried to sit here and plan all those you'd have a devil the time but you do it max identity they just fall in there get that but we never we never admit this was an accident somebody asked well we slammed this side of a gun right in the beginning I watch a lot of people when they first start selling paintings in it people will say it's gonna sell it painting they say yeah yeah I want to sell that painting but there's a couple little errors and you know this trees wrong or those mountains are wrong don't tell nobody that huge Uddin you wouldn't even buy somebody else's mistakes nobody's gonna buy yours if they didn't like the painting they wouldn't ask you maybe the thing and that painting that troubles you the most just what makes them the happiest so don't ruin their illusion here I'm using a little bit shadow color and just bringing it down I'm gonna take the small knife go right into some very dark color I want to increase the intensity of some of these shadows back here like a dad this little knife gets into some places it you might find a little difficult with a big knife there it just slips right in look at their baby was a little more shadow right in there there might even be the tiniest little bit of light it hits oh look at that mmm look at that that easy you bring it around look at there create all kinds of beautiful little effects just just letting a knife just grazing crazy I want to sort of slope out a little lights singing through there and hitting take a dry brush make sure these brushes are dry out when you do this if they're wet you're gonna watch your painting just just drip off your canvas then you're going to be mad at me and I want you to be happy with your paintings and happy with us okay now we can play a little more take a little more this yellow ocher some bright red and some Sienna with this mix all this together a little white next once again don't over mix it see there now you have to start making some decisions where does this live there couch look at look at what happens there because you did not over mix that paint comes down there it is we'll just let it go let it go let it go like that just let it go wherever I'm gonna take in touch a little bit of the same color with more white in it just to spark light up just so little lightest a little lights just playing through hearing zing hips and if you can please there's one right there and sometimes life things happen going back to my little knife and back behind here we need a shadow look at that see that makes out a separate entity just by putting a shadow behind it just look here and we come down in here and we can raise parts out look right there it's about putting a little dark area and changing the angle angles are very important when you're doing mountains very very important okay I'm gonna take and go into the tiniest a little bit of a CAD yellow with that big brush just tap the bristles in it okay maybe right up here this I look at here little grass that grows right up the side of that mountain just wherever just let it sort of blend together and have fun there little fix just let your brush work you can put the least little touch of SAP green here in there oh look at that see how it separates brings those apart looks like a whole separate entity just that easy tell you what maybe I'm just gonna throw some dark in here and watch watch what happens watch what happens go back to the same old brush take some that dark color look it there look there just begin bringing all this together you could make the multitude of things happen just by using the brush but all these little things just live in here and play okay take off somebody excess paint soften that right up like Oh ready already with a clean brush we can soften a team a little more and create the illusion of mist in it okay I think that gives you a general idea of how to make a fantastic little mountain I won't go in here and drop it a few little background trees we'll just use some black and some blue pick up some white any little brown what the heck what's that there we go okay let's go right up here maybe there's some happy little trees that live right here all right go wherever you want there we are see you just make as many trees here well you will stop them right there that's enough that's enough right there now with good dry brush I want to just tap this just tap it softens it all up theft upward very lightly just blend it out that gives us a nice little layer some background trees let's go we use the round brush I'm going still into the black add a little SAP green to it little brown can you go up here maybe there's a happy little tree and he lives right there whole bunch of little trees just tap the knees in I'm using a darker color here so it stands out against the other color yeah we put a few highlights on it that'll show too we'll just drop some down here that'll be reflections right into a little bit of the yellow the yellow ocher and then you can put look at there few little highlights these trees are closer you're beginning to see some highlights and now just tap them off very lightly don't overdo don't overdo just a few but a few and layers look there that easy that easy you got some nice little background trees yeah we'll take 2 inch brush grab it and pull down look at there at quick you got some beautiful little reflections maybe one of the nicest things that happens and this technique is reflections you just pull it down very lightly go across and you have instant instant reflections take a little bit liquid white do that add a little bit blue it's very thin paint cut across it let's go up here that then will give us some water lines back here and these little trees helps create the illusion of depth it shows different planes again take the point of the knife not get a few little sticks and twigs just like so okay I'm going back to the same old round brush go back into some brown and green black and maybe right here yeah you're right there lives a nice little happy tree it comes right down I can't just like think like a tree when you do these baby right on back through here so maybe there's a big son of a gun there a little bit of that dark Seanna I had that right in there just just be a little background drop it down there there we go right quick okay tell you what let's do the same thing right over here maybe there's a happy little thing right there this sort of this verb helps helps with a composition it bring some borders around the edge makes the painting look a little better pushes everything father back there we go sounds like so it's a nice warm tones in here okay now there let's take the old fan brush here I'll put in a few basic little tree trunks we'll just use some Brown just a little bit of brown there we go let's go up here maybe there's a happy little tree trunk in there right there there's one plus some indications we're not looking for a lot of detail right now just hearing their top on that now I'm going to take a one inch brush we dip it into a little bit of the liquid white let's go into some yellows some greens little yellow ochre just mix them on the brush okay let's go there let's begin popping in just nice little highlights on some of these little trees here that easy okay add a little bright red to that look at there hmm all kinds of beautiful little effects and do this in layers so it creates creates all kinds of depth in there now happy little reflection right there all right cross and we got that rascal let's put a few on the other side there yes right there hmm here we're just using the brush side Birds just bend them right out okay listen let's have a few little stones down here so you'll take a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown clean off my knife come right down here there we go there is a little stone right there maybe just some over here too can't ever tell why this polo fitments down it'll end up being reflections like so dry it out like it wherever you are maybe tell you what there's a little stone out or there's another one maybe we'll just have a bunch of them out here in the water just drag them across I can take a little big brush let's bring this right on down this is just brown and green just a nice dark color down like hmm we getting crazy here I don't know what's gonna happen we'll use a little bit of this brown and white just put a little highlight here and there are some of these little stones these little stones out here need some highlight on to let it bounce around and play just like so now you know me I always like to have a little cabin let's fill this little cabin right about here just a little one there you go look at that little rascal that easy why wished it was really that easy to build a little cabin out no listen look at there yeah we'll take some Brown just alright I'll put a few little highlights on it front of him here I can take the knife cut through make it look like some old slabs little bit of brown give him a door can I have a door let me touch you hide around the door so it stands out now let's take I'll use a little bit of red and brown mixed together put some red on its roof here go bloop what do to do to do to do to do let's let that fall right off you nicely there easy way to make a quick little indication of happy little roof a little light color here to make him stand out now then remember the yellow we can pop in a few happy little bushes around his foots and over here let's do this site over here here's a nice little bush look at that she just let these little rascals layer after layer after layer just layering effect Oh once again I know you're tired of hearing me say it but this layering effect is what creates the depth in your painting let's have some fun let's put let's put a few big old trees and remover right into the Van Dyck Brown and the sienna just mix them together make a decision I think as a tree it lives it's right there big tree and he's got a friend there there yes okay it's going the other side maybe over here there's really some big trees and I'm gonna get a letter sure as a devil says why did you mess up that painting with all those trees there we go there's another big tree that one right there however many trees you want you just drop them in just drop them in and we'll take a little bit of the liquid black the liner brush with some thinner on it let's drop in a few indications of some happy little nails here and there just a few and are you doing this at home you put as many in as you want I just want to show you how to do it there we go just however many a few and knees over here don't want them to be left out there okay they're just drop them in you take a little bit liquid white and highlight a few of them just wherever okay I want to take a little bit of a little bit of highlight color and just my keys stand out just barely touching give it a little pull see just barely touch pull it look at that make the little trees just stand right out just think of which side the light would hit then go little bit a little bit right over here don't want this tree to get lonely leave him out he'll get upset they don't like unhappy trees in our paintings all right tell you what tell you what we got just about enough time left up play around here and we'll put a few little happy leaves there I'll take a little CAD yellow a little satin green and I'm just just tapping that brush right into it okay let's go right up here now then just think about where the leaves would be see just to help them keep a lot of paint on your brush a lot of paint leave them loose and very airy hope that's a proper word Airy sounds good anyway you know what I mean sometimes I'm bad about making up words so don't pay any attention and if you're young and still going to school don't tell you English teacher and she'll be writing me bad letters to see how you make the indication of thousands of little leaves that quick let's do this over here look just tap think of a basic shapes though you want here don't just hit a minute random look at that look at that look at that oh I get excited when I see these things maybe that's the reason I continue to paint it's one of the few things that you paint for a million years you always know the next painting you do is gonna be a little bit better you're gonna learn a little more like that alright I think we can take a one inch brush here with a little paint on it let's go right down here just foot s'en let's put some happy little things right there this foots okay I'm just about out of time someone take a little bit color here a little bit of water line right around here just a tiny bit pull this down I'd like to thank you for being with us today I hope you've enjoyed this one and I look forward to seeing you next time and until then from all of us here happy painting
