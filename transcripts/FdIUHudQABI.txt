- Hi, welcome back. I'm certainly glad you
could join us today. Thought today we'd just do
a fantastic little painting. It'll just make you feel good in here. So, let's start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. And they'll come across right about there. See them? Okay, let's go up here. Today, I just have a plain old white, pre-stretched double primed canvas, and I've covered it with a very thin, even coat of liquid white. So, it's all wet, and it's slick and it's all ready to go, and so let's just do a fantastic
little painting together. I thought maybe today we'd just start with the old two inch
brush, a little pthalo blue, and just load a little color
right into the bristles. Like so. Just a little, we don't
need a whole bunch. It's easy to add more color, but sometimes it's a son of
a gun to try to take it off. Okay, let's go right up here. We'll start right at the top of the canvas and we'll make little x's. Little crisscross strokes. Something about like so. And if you start at the top of the canvas, work all the way across and then begin working downward in layers, it'll mix with the liquid
white that's on the canvas and automatically, automatically it'll get lighter in value as you work down toward the horizon. And that's exactly what we're looking for. And the little crisscross strokes will give you little actions that are happening in the sky. So it's not just a flat old dead sky. It has some character to it. There we go. Something about like that. Whatever. Whatever, it doesn't much matter. We'll bright it right
on down to about there. Okay. Now, maybe I'll just add a
touch of alizarin crimson right on that old brush with the blue. Just a little though,
I don't want too much. Just a little. And I'm gonna start down here. And just put a little lavender hue. Sort of lavender color. And we wanna let that sort of work upward. Because I want that lavender
color to be down here. But, it's not very strong. It's just enough that you know it's there. Sometimes in paintings, it's nice to take and make the corners of the paintings much darker. And that way, when you
look at the painting, your eye is automatically
drawn toward the center. There we go. So, we'll just take a little
of the midnight black, and we'll just put a
little bit in the corners, just like so. And then we'll blend that right in. Something about like that. Sometimes I use a little prussian blue. Let's use a little prussian blue in fact, what the heck? We'll mix that right in
there with the black. Prussian blue is much darker and stronger, and it just blends right in. It'll make the top of this
painting and the corners a little bit darker. There. It also creates that illusion of depth and distance in you painting. And that's what we're looking for. That's what we're looking for. Alright. Now then, down here. Tell you what, we have to decide what we're gonna paint today. I think, I tell you what let's do. I live in Florida, and in Florida we have a lot of
gorgeous, gorgeous swamps. That's where a lot of my
little creatures live. So, let's do a little swamp scene today that's very simple. And if you've never painted a swamp scene, this is one you can do. This is a nice one. I wanna take a little
bit of that pthalo blue, a little alizarin crimson, and I'm just mixing them on the brush. Think I'll make a little
more of that lavender color. Let's go right up in here. If we're gonna make a swamp, let's make one that's colorful. It's pretty. Make you feel good just to look at it. There we go. And we'll just pull this straight across. Pulling from the outside in. Something about like that. Think I'll leave a little
area open right here so it'll look like a sheen of light, and maybe we'll come back and
put a bright color in there, something that'll just sparkle a little. Same thing here, I wanna make these corners a little darker than the rest of the painting. And already, your eyes
should automatically be going to right in here. Let's wash the old brush. If you've painted with me before, you know this is the fun
part of this whole technique. There. Shake off the excess. (chuckles) And just cover
everybody around you. If you do this at home, there's a thing made
called a bush beater rack that you put down in a little garbage can and you shake the brush inside of the can, and then beat the devil
out of this little rack. And I tell you right now, it'll save you a happy home and your
marriage and all that. Because if you do that
in your living room, chances are your spouse is gonna
kill you right on the spot. I'm gonna take a little pink. I'm gonna put a little
bit of alizarin crimson right in that little area. Right in there, something about like that. And that'll give us some nice base colors for what we're looking for. And maybe in our world, maybe in our world there lives some happy little clouds. Use a little fan brush today. Take some white, I'll be right back. I'm gonna get a little, there. Whoops, maybe a little more. A little touch of the bright red. I wanna put a little pink
sparkle in these clouds. Load a lot of color in the brush. Okay, let's go up in here. Now, have to decide where
your little clouds live. In our world, I think one lives, yeah, you're right. Right there. There he is. Little rascal just runs around, has fun all day. I like clouds. They're very free. Very free. There, we give him a
little more right there. We just let him go. Wherever you want him to go. It doesn't matter. There we go. There we go. A little touch more of the bright red, because I want this to
have a little pinky, a little pink flavor to it. Ooh, maybe that's too much pink flavor. We'll just dull him down. That's all there is to it, just add a little more white. Dull him down a little. And we just sort of let that wander off. Wherever. I think I'll put some big trees back here. We'll probably cover up half of these, so we're not too worried about them. Not too worry about them. If you've never seen a swamp, they're most, most interesting. There are so many fantastic creatures live in the swamp. It's sorta the start
of the whole ecosystem. That's where all your
little creatures come from. So, we have to preserve
some of the swamps. There. As I say, I live in Florida, and we have some of the
most gorgeous swamps there. There we go. And there's a lot of swamps all the way up into Georgia. and Louisiana, all through there. Beautiful, beautiful areas. And here's so much
wildlife in one of these. Every so often I drive
down to The Everglades and just go out and look at all the little alligators and the birds and the egrets, and all kinds of little creatures that live out in there. There. See, and that easy, we've got the indication of a little, a little cloudy area that
lives way back in there. Shoot, that's a lot of fun. Let's wash the old brush. (chuckles) I just like to wash the brush. (laughs) I got a cameraman
that gives me a hard time. This is the way I get even with him. Alright, and I got another one dirty here, but we won't wash it. I'll just take a little crimson, pick up a little prussian blue. I'm gonna make a lavender color toward the blue side. You could make it toward the red side or the blue side. Today I'm gonna make it
toward the blue side. Let's go right up in here. I'm just gonna put some little indications of some little trees that live way, way back in the
distance here and there. Little clump. These are going to be cypress trees, and they grow in clumps. There. So, we'll just put in
some basic little shapes, like so. Don't want a lot of detail, because these are too far away. Too much detail would ruin
the illusion of distance. Something about like that. There we go. Just using the corner of the brush and just tapping in some
very basic little shapes. Maybe we'll do a big cypress tree. Yeah, let's do a big cypress
tree in the foreground. And we'll put some detail in those. Right out here though, these are ones that are far away. We're not looking for detail in them. Take a little yellow ochre, a little indian yellow, and we'll just come back in there. That makes a green with
what we've got on there. Sort of a greenish... But just an indication of a
few highlights here and there. This is sorta, separates
the individual trees. There we go. There we are. All kinds of little things. There are all kinds of little creatures live all the way out here. In the last show, we
showed a little baby fox. I wonder if you got to see him. He is so precious. There. Something about like that. I'm gonna take my little liner brush. Little script liner. And let's take, we'll use that same old lavender color. It doesn't much matter. Thin the paint down with paint thinner. Okay, let's go right up in here. And we'll put the indication here and there, and there and here, of some little trunks. These are far away, we're not worried about much detail. Here and there, we can put an arm, but don't put a bunch of detail. It'll ruin the illusion of distance. Ruin that illusion. That's what makes your painting special. There. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, yep. You're right. You're right, wherever you want them. Okay, now we take a, we'll use a fan brush for a while. Get an old fan brush,
I'll use that same color. Alizarin crimson and prussion blue, mix them together, make a
lavender to the blue side. Lavender to the blue side. We'll use that. I'm pushing upward. Giving it an upward push with the brush. Pushing pretty firmly, I
wanna bend that rascal. Bend it. Just something like that. Shoot, it may be over in here. Maybe there's some little
trees back in here, too. We're gonna put some back here. This may show through a little. That'll help create that illusion of more trees back over in there. Just in case some of it shows. I'm gonna put a big tree right there. I know that already. I can feel a big tree coming. (laughs) If you've painted with me before, you know I really like
those old big trees, so invariably before we're finished, we're gonna have a big tree here. Take a little sap green, a little yellow, mix them together. Make a nice green color, maybe a little yellow ochre, too. Ooh, that's nice. Let's go up here. And just take that. We'll begin putting in a little indication of some bushes and weeds
that grow way back in here. Small, swampy things. There they come. Little bit more right in here. Maybe like that. It doesn't much matter. It doesn't much matter. Take another fan brush, put a little bit of pthalo
blue and white on the brush. And maybe right in here, just to give it a little cool area. Just wanna put a little
blue right in here. Very little. Very little. Just cool it down a little. Like that. Alright. Now, it looks like something that's far, far away back there. Let's take the old brush here that's got the lavender on it, and let's just begin pulling
some of that color down. There, see. Straight down, straight down. Gonna make the indication of a nice reflection back in there. Straight down. Alright, now very lightly just go across and that'll help create that illusion of reflection in your water. Let's take a little liquid white, and we'll put a little bit
of the pthalo blue in it. Just to sparkle it up a little. It's a pretty color. Cut across, just like so. See? Pull it out flat, and cut across. It gives you a little bit of paint right out on the edge of the knife. Okay. Then you can go up here with
that little bit of paint and you can just begin cutting
in a little water line. Something about like that. There. Now, normally swamp
water is not real deep. There are exceptions to that, but most of the time swamp
water is pretty shallow. Pretty shallow, so I don't
wanna make this look real deep. And it looks, swamp water
looks blackish, unclean, but it's really, it's really
as I mentioned earlier it's where the whole ecosystem starts. Is right there. The swamps are very, very important. We really need to preserve some of them. There. Okay. Now, we can start having some fun. Let's find an old filbert brush. I think we'll take the old filbert and go into a little
bit of van dyke brown, a little dark sienna. Just mix them up, it doesn't much matter. Maybe back here, there's an old, let's go right up in here, maybe there's an old cypress tree that maybe, maybe he's a tired old tree. And cypress trees down toward the base are normally very fat. Big old fat trees. Sorta funny looking. Maybe he's got a friend right here. And you have what's called cypress knees. They call them cypress knees. They're just little
protrusions that come up of cypress out of the water. So we'll draw one of those here too. Okay, we can take a little bit of white, a little brown on it. And maybe, maybe our light's gonna come from that, so we'll highlight that side a little bit. There we go. Right over in there. And we'll come back with a liner brush and work on that a little bit more later. But right now, that's good enough. Good enough. Let's take a little black,
a little prussian blue, brown, crimson, all the good dark colors, a little sap green. Put them all together, mix
them up on the fan brush. Make a good dark color. And we'll just pop in a
little area right here so we can have like a little, maybe a little grass is growing
right around this rascal. Maybe it's just growing
right around like that. Take that same old brush, we'll go right into the yellow. Because there's blue in
there we'll get green. And we can just pop in some indications of little grassy areas
that live all down in here. Take our two inch brush, pull downward. Create a little reflection. There. Okay back to our liquid
white on the knife, and we can put a water
line right around that. Right around there. Isn't that fun? I like doing little swamp scenes. Of course, I like going out in the swamp and just watch the creatures out there, the little animals and everything. They're a lot of fun. Big old alligators there where I live. Some big old alligators. When I was just a child, I used to have an alligator for a pet. I worked for, years and years ago, I worked for a store. One year at Christmas, and instead of paying me money, I was only about ten years old, they gave me several exotic pets, and one of them was an alligator. And he was only about a foot long when they gave him to me. I'll never forget, I took that rascal home and I wasn't real popular with my mother when I dumped him out
in the living room floor out of a big old bag. But she let me keep him. And I kept him for maybe, probably about a year, a year and a half, and he grew to probably close to two and a half, three feet long. But, he got mean. I don't think you can ever
make a pet out of an alligator. So, I took him down to
one of the local lakes and turned him loose. I'll make a big tree. And chances are, he's still there today. Shoot, by now he's probably huge. He's probably scaring swimmers to death. (laughs) Alright. I'm using the filbert brush because I want this paint to be very thick. Very, very thick. I'm gonna put a lot of paint on there, because I'm gonna come back, and use that thick paint to catch the highlight color. There we go. Once again, we got all these little things that grow down here around his foots. And they're not always straight. Sometimes they're crooked and gnarly and, I guess that's a word. They have all kinds of little shapes. Shoot, maybe there's one
that came up out there. Alright. There's another one. Just van dyke brown and
dark sienna mixed together. Very thick. Very, very thick. And I like this filbert brush for that. Okay, you know. (laughs) I have to have a big tree. Have to have an old big tree. There he comes. Big old tree. And it doesn't really matter
much how you put this on, as long as you have a big basic shape. We're gonna come back and
put all the highlights and all the things that
make it sparkle in there. Right now, we're just looking
for texture on the canvas. Let's have two trees. What the heck? I like these old big trees. I'm glad we put that back here. Some if it is showing through. I wasn't sure if it would or not. You just sorta see these
scenes in your mind and you don't know exactly
how they're gonna come out. And that's alright. You don't mind. Cypress trees sorta grow in clumps. So, we're gonna have a bunch of trees, all different ages and sizes. Some of them big, some little. Shoot, maybe they just go
right on off the canvas here. Here's one right here. Ooh, a big one. He just lives right along here. We'll separate all these with highlights. Right now all we're doing, once again, is just blocking it in
with a lot of color. Let them get very big
at the bottom, though. Big at the bottom. There we go. Something like that. And while we have that color on there, we'll just pull a little bit down. Because we're gonna pull that down and make a reflection out of it, so it doesn't matter. Just scrub a little in there. Take your big brush, decide what you want to be reflections. Pull it down. Because we don't make mistakes. We don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents. See there? Now then, let's take
our script liner brush I'm gonna take a little white, a little dark sienna, mix them together. Something about like so. Put a little alizarin
crimson in there too, just to give it a little warm flavor. A lot of paint thinner. We're gonna thin this paint down until it's almost the consistency of ink. Be right back. There, see? You can see it running
right there on the pallet. Okay, let's go right up here. Now, with this liner brush we said our light was, things are gonna be
highlighted on the right, so just take the liner brush and just let the edge of
it, just the edge of it. I'm holding it almost flat, almost perpendicular there
to the canvas, or whatever. Just let it graze. This is where you separate
all of your beautiful trees. Let it graze. Just barely, barely touching, and it'll look like real bark. There, a little more paint thinner. There, and there's a big
one hiding right in here. All we gotta do is pull him out. There he comes, there he comes. He's in there. He's in there. There. We use cypress wood to make panelings, and they use the logs to make log cabins. There we go. A little bit over in here. Now, at home you have unlimited time and you can really take your time and put a lot of detail here. You can make it a lot nicer than this one. Here, I just want to show you how. Just show you how. Something like so. That one we'll have behind there. A little bit in here. We gotta put some nice
leaves on these yet. We can take a little
bit of blue and white, and put the indication of a little reflected
white over on this side, just to make a shadow. There we go. Something like so. There. And you can even take, even though you don't see one there, you can just pull out a little knee. A little cypress knee right in there, just by doing that. See, now he stands out. Okay, let's grab us a fan brush. We gonna take some black,
prussian blue, sap green. Good, dark color. We gotta put some leaves on our tree. Okay, let's go up in here and decide where our old tree lives. Boy, he lives right up here
at the top of the canvas. He got big old arms that
stick out everywhere. Here comes one. There they go. We're just really using a lot of pressure. There, pushing it in. Just push it right in. Okay. There. These are fun old trees to paint. And sometimes, sometimes the
top of the tree is naked, and down here will be a few little limbs. They just grow any old
way that makes them happy. Shoot, there they come right across there. And if you're really brave, (chuckles) it's your bravery test, maybe there's a few that
grow right down there. Who knows? It's up to you. Wherever, wherever you
think they should be. Something like that. Something like that. We can take our liner brush, put a little bit of the brown color, and maybe there's a big old
limb that comes right down so that has something to sit on. Looky there. Something about like that. One here. Wherever. Not too many. Let a few old limbs hang around Alright. We'll just wipe off the excess paint and use that same brush that had the dark color on it, go into our yellow. And yellow ochre, indian yellow, just mix them all together. And instantly, we have green. So let's go back and put a few highlights up here on these. Just a few little highlights. Think about shape and form, though. Don't just hit that rascal at random. Think where you're going. It's like taking a trip. You need to know your destination. Same here. I've met some drivers on the road that, they have no destination. Bet you've met some of those too. There we go. Something like so. See there? But that easy, it gives the indication of a lot of nice little leaves and stuff that live down here. Okay, take some more of our dark color. The blue, the black, sap green. Put a little dark down here at his foots. There we are. A lot of times these little grassy areas grow around their foots. Maybe there's another one right in here. Who knows? Wherever you want them. Little bit of our green. Just pop in some little
highlights in all these areas. Something about like that. Okay, a little more over here. Don't want that one left out. There we go. Take our knife, a little
bit of that liquid white, a little color in it. Put an indication of a little water line. It sort of cleans up
the bottom of all this. Brings it all together. Gives borders to it. There. Something like so. And sometimes, if you're really brave, maybe you can put a little
bird sitting right here. We'll take and scrape out
some of this excess color. It's really better if you
wait until the thing is dry. Then you can put him on easy. We'll just take a little liquid white. Put the indication here of maybe a little egret that sits right out here. Something about like that. I would really suggest you
wait until your painting's dry. Take a little orange, put a little beak on there,
a couple of little legs. And this sort of gives the indication of a little bird that lives out there. We'll put him an eyeball in there and call him finished. With that, I think we're
gonna call this one done. Really hope you've enjoyed this painting from all of us we'd like to wish you happy painting, God bless, my friend. ("Interlude" by Larry Owens)
