welcome back I'm certainly glad you joined me today and today I thought we'd do the little animated opening the little painting you see at the beginning of each show and I'll show you basically how that painting was done now when we produced that actual animated opening I have a little more time and then a lot of fantastic people spend a lot of time making that happen so let's take and haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white it's wet and ready to go so let's get started I'm gonna go right down here we'll start with the old two-inch brush we'll go right into a little Indian yellow and a little bright red and just mix them together right there just like so okay let's go up here now I want some happy little things happening up here in the sky so we'll bring surrounds back and forth and sort of let it go like that this will not be an exact duplicate because can't ever paint the same exact picture twice but it'll show you how the painting was made and you can make your own at home we'll put a little bit down here I know there's gonna be some water down here okay now I'm gonna mix up a little lavender color so for that we'll use crimson a little bit of the blue much much much more crimson than blue much more crimson and blue the blue is a hundred times stronger than the crimson now if you really want to test it take a little white put it there hmm okay that's good enough let me clean my knife without cleaning the brush I'll go right into a little bit of this lavender color kidding let's go up here now here and there I'm gonna just add a little bit of that just a little here and there this sort of acts as a barrier between these colors just a little bit here and there just let you brush just gently gently graze the canvas there we are without cleaning the brush I'm gonna go right in to a little bit the midnight black and a tiny touch of Prussian blue back and forth back and forth all right let's go up here now then still just barely grazing the canvas we'll just sort of fill this in a little all right maybe right here that a little bit in there let's take it right on out a little bit right there okay now we can clean the brush clean the brush here we go the screen in the bottom of this Candida scrub the brush against that keeps us solid materials at the bottom that's the fun part all right now with this clean dry brush I'd be sure it's dry go back up in here and you can blend all this together why this is one bright sky there we go any of the paintings that we've done in the series if if you want to tone them down please please feel free sometimes I make them a little brighter than they normally would be just so they stand out well and you sit because everybody's TV is adjusted a little bit different and you can blend this to any degree of smoothness that you want or you can believe it let's take it to that there okay now then and then thank it was a little a little melting back there I just use a little the blue and the black just like so cut off a little bit tiny little roll of paint there it is a little tiny bit and it lives does now anyway right about here it's interesting I have to tell you about this painting I did this painting when I did a live demonstration in Boston at Merrimack College for several hundred fantastic people and then the PBS station in Boston auctioned this painting off I was so impressed with it that I decided to use it in this series really really did like this paint we travel all over the country doing demonstrations for PBS stations and educational stations try to help them make a happy buck or two okay let's do a big mountain in here let's go into some black we'll use some of that same old purplish color we had black and purple a little Van Dyck Brown into it main thing is it is dark cut off a hunk of paint there on the roll there you can see it let's go back up here now begin laying in your basic basic mountain shape here it comes right down I guess just drop it in drop it in you know since this page painting originated in Boston follow dedicated to some fantastic friends that I have there to all the people who came to watch the show and it made me feel at home some of the nicest people in the world there and to all of you thank you very much it really did make me feel at home and I'd like to come back and paint again for you someday okay now to our big brush pull that down pull it down down down just let it blend out let it blend down this is a fun painting this is what middle yes give you a little challenge it is fine we were just blending this color right out it just disappears and today today I'm gonna do something a little bit different and I normally do I'm going to put the shadows in first so I'm going to take some white we'll take some of that this is something that a lavender color we used and I only had a little blue debt very colorful little painting like so cut off a tiny little bit okay scope here yeah right here maybe lives a little shadow tune just letting me tell you what and nice a little big let me get my small knife it really there see it gets in there a little easier gets in there so much easier and then we can just just put in some very basic little ideas and I don't take some red take some red use some of that lavender right into it little yellow ocher like it don't wanna over mix cut off a little bit let's go right up here way back here fairly barely touching I had a little more ochre to that so it stands out a little more you can see it a little better in home there okay maybe there's a little bit that lives right there just let that play right down through there mix a little more color here let me add some of the dark CNN there cut off a little bit just begin working back and forth with some of these beautiful little colors just let them play there's some it's a little bit lighter see how they just sort of blend together all those pretty little things happen right up to here hmm there it comes right down over under wherever just let them happen there we go to the last maybe this use some dark color here first there was a bump lived right out here need that dark color so the light Oh show who put it on don't do that let's go right in there I had a few of these little things and let him begin falling down see there we need to go back and let's see here so blue little purplish color still quite blue there we go there we go and don't overmix it leave it about like it cut you off a little bit let's go out up here and we can go right in here but indication of some happy little shadows that live there maybe that can come straight down I say this little knife works very well for getting into these small tight areas it's another piece of equipment that sort of developed from a lot of people writing and asking for it just hearing yeah okay now the clean dry - inspiration from Jimmy gently begin tapping that just have it pick up a little bit color and bring it down and follow these angles these angles are hunting very important helps create many many different layers in this panel yeah they don't only put some Sparkle on it someone takes just some titanium white and let's go up in here and barely touch just let this flow right down into the misty area we'll just put us some sparkle here it comes right around drops down through there there we go there we go and right there oh that really makes it stand out didn't it there we go damn back to her clean dry brush and I'm gonna very lightly tap and just sort of lift upward hearing their first like yeah yeah that's like you don't want to overkill yeah then back to the black and blue and I want to lose shadow back in here a little shadow and maybe some of these little things just sort of spill over a little bit into it my cat now for the big brush I'm going tap that shadow tap it pick up a little that color and I'm gonna bring this right around see here see now you've created that a little doer that comes all the way around there like that look at that just let it go and you can make plane after plane after plane and you're painting take me clean that brush so it's nice and clean then we can create a nice misty effect got that cameraman again he's gonna give me when this is over that just removes excess paint when I tap it like yeah okay now just blend it a little bit so it creates the illusion of gist we don't care where this goes right here yeah yeah that gives us a general idea of how that mountain was made okay let's go into a little bit of the blue little blue blue tap a little of that in okay let's go back up here and if we're gonna have water down here let's begin dropping in some little indications see I put that little tiny bit of yellow now where the blue hit said it's gonna turn slightly greenish which is nice sometimes we we fight to keep that from happening today they able to use that see there hmm but I don't want to kill all that there we go and I'm losing a few little areas open all right okay watch this brush one more time er that's really the most fun part of this whole technique gets out all your frustrations and hostilities if you're gonna do this in your living room i really i really suggest you get a rush beater rack and that that fits in the bottom but wastepaper can and it'll contain this otherwise somebody's gonna be awful upset when you cover the whole living room all right I get the big over and brushing I'm going right back into that nice lavender color we made earlier just tap it in there this was a lizard crimson and oppression blue let's go back up here and I want to drop in the little indication of some trees and live we back here in the distance there they go just a few of those and we'll drop a little bit of it right down in here don't want to lose all that nice light area but a little just so we have some nice little reflections but a large brush we can grab that now pull it down just pull down cause of canvases wet that easy we create the illusion of reflections and we still have that little glow in there okay we're going to the least little touch of green and yellow I didn't clean the brush just tap the tiniest little bit of that in there I want just a tiny tiny little indication that there's some leaves on these trees back here they're too far away I don't want to ruin the illusion of distance with detail there we go little son's playing through there earlier now then as they get a little closer then you can add a little bit more detail maybe there's one that lives right here and comes right down yep there is see maybe over here there is one so you can create all different planes in your painting and go back to this brush grab a little touch of that pull it down pull it down pull it down pull it down and that becomes part of the reflections that we are okay now taking a knife little bit of the liquid line and to that I'm going to put a little touch of blue a little touch cut across it let's go up here just give the indication of some happy little water lines that live right there they go that simple this is a very thin paints almost like water and it'll flow right on top of that thicker paint this on the canvas golden rule Dan pain stick to thick paint okay and you could take some it's just pure white and even highlight it a little more if you wanted to see how that sets all that back you keep these lines basically straight are you or your water will run right out of the painting get your floor wet then you'll be upset with me let's take some Brown dark Sienna just some of these good dark colors here let's go right up here yeah I think I think I think right here yep we'll have a happy little tree looks like a happy big tree my son we're going to growing on us look at they're just bringing right on out there we go color it's a big tree that lived right here just letting work right off your brush like you're giving some arms you need some arms tree need some arms he's going to reach out and gather up the Sun become big and strong keep a big strong arm there we don't care if some of this pops down into the water we'll turn that into reflections and as we know reflections are one of the nicest easiest things are to do in this technique okay start here and we just let this run oh it's lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter lighter lighter same I want it to be darker to bottom because that's where the biggest shadows are they hide down at the bottom of the trees and bushes okay into some more Browns little black whatever add some SAP green to that this comes right over all right now once again we don't care if it goes into the water that's all going to be reflections no big deal we depend on it there we go okay now let's turn that into some happy little reflections look here OOP just pull that there and that's fantastic look at that look at that their encounter okay we don't make any mistakes we have happy accidents why sure we stat line it works and I was a kid with my mother she used to spank me for them happy accidents all right going to some Brown when she hears this she's gonna spank me again all right all right up here let's put a trunk in this tree mmm-hmm give him a little curve OOP there he is there he is there yeah maybe just an indication over here we don't know how many trunks there we don't care just a few right in there all right I'll take the knife and a little more real to that color this is red brown white there cut across it let's go right up here we'll put some happy little highlights right here on this tree just like so this is all straight right now I just want to put an edge only such stands out a little better just let that knife touch it bounce play yeah I'm gonna go into a little bit of the liquid black or some of our palate that's easier a little bit of paint thinner yeah it's even thinner than it was this is like water turn it brush bring it to a point let's go up here put a few little trunk indicator Liam indication I got the trunk already and don't laugh you'll get old make mistakes one day like I do happens to the best of us there I got just a few little indications there we are now I'll clean that brush I can go right into a little bit of liquid white and just put some see now they stand out now you can really see them in a super way to put a bunch of little branches and stuff on the tree it's Purdy okay now now Russia's dirty let me get one is clean I'll go right into a little bit of the CAD yellow and the yellow ocher some bright red tap this can't go up here and then let's put some happy little things that are happening right up here and upon that tree see you that's how those were made jealous drop em in put a little bit of liquid white on my breast in and paint in will stick to L there we go that's what we're looking for see the 10 stick add a little of the liquid white or a little tiny bit of thinner and then then drops right in there maybe hole I got tied and go on I'll just put a few happy little indications over here I'm not looking for detail on this side just a few little indications good that's enough let's let's get down here let me grab a one-inch brush going to a little bit of the liquid white go right through some yellow some yellow yellow yellow SAP green pull that brush in one direction loaded full all right let's go up here now then maybe there's a happy little thing it lives right there see there he comes there he comes just drop them in working layers work and layers a little yellow ocher with the color making oh look at that sparkle I get excited sometime I watched this over and over and still fascinates me now Oh an evergreen in this one I'll take some Browns black some green just load that brush fold I know I'm jumping all over the palette here let's go up to the canvas there is a happy evergreen that lives right there and just pushing right out of your brush there is and we don't even get lonely we give them a little friend this is Charlie this is Charlie okay just use the same low brush and want a little bit of lighter green color and put the indication of a few little highlights will do Charlie here okay down now machan Vanek and to my one-inch brush and this puts them let's put some happy little things over on this side we don't want it to be left out you can do this with a bondage pressure round brush works quite nice it's not as fast but it does work very well when you're at home practicing play with it a little bit you'll enjoy there we go all kinds of things and just layer these drop them in tell you what I want awesome stones there we had some stones and that so this use some of the Browns and let's go right in here Lupin make little sounds it helps helps let's drop them in big stone right there however many there we go there's a nice little stone comes right down a little bit of land area we'll use some of this for some highlight this is just same thing as using on the tree there we go it comes out across here and down just make all kinds of little stones and pretty little things happen like so now back into our liquid white we head on a pallet of a little water line this cleans it all up so I'm gonna split that line right down through there okay yeah we'll bring us it came right out out like it yeah that was the way it did okay I'm back to my one-inch brush going to a little bit of yellows and greens okay and we can pop in a happy little leaves here all kinds of little things that are happening don't go there don't go there now then yeah then we want to put we had a couple of big old trees in that rascal so let's do that again get my fan brush take the over and go right into the Van Dyck Brown loaded full decide where you treat lifts make a big decision and you drop it in drop it in it's your world so you put your treat wherever you want it okay there was two trees so oh right to my Mountain yeah got him got him there's a big ole tree this is just Van Dyck Brown okay and then let the knife slow just use that same will highlight color see right there it's working so well and just use that just barely barely touching it sort of bounce around just it'll grab what it wants but the indication of some highlights right on this tree like the Hat a little bit on this one back here don't even be left out see there see there there it goes there it goes you know I'd love to hear from if you have time drop your line let me know which paintings you like which paintings you don't like I really really enjoy hearing a little bit of blue on this side just indicate a little reflected light here and there there we go just a little touch can I'm gonna go back into the liquid black and a little paint thinner we'll put a few happy little little lambs out here zoom just let them drop off there however many you want and these are fun these are a lot of fun okay we'll just put the indication here and there of a few there we go there we go and in your tree you decide how many leaves and how many limbs it has okay and you can highlight those also a little bit of the white where a few little hangy downs here and there I think if we put a we put a few little highlights on that leaves would have a finished painting the old clock on the walls telling me I got to get out of here for the day so I'll leave you putting a few leaves on the two-inch brush just having I hope this has showed you how the little animated painting has worked hope all my friends and Boston enjoyed it and I look forward to seeing you again next time until then from all of us here happy painting god bless we'll see again you
