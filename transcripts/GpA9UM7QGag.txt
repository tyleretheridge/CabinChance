hello I'm Bob Ross and I'd like to welcome you to the 14th joy of painting series first of all I'd like to thank you for inviting me back for another series of painting shows if this is your first time with us then let me extend a personal invitation B to get out your brushes and paint along I tell you what or just drag up the old easy chair and spend a relaxing half-hour enjoying some of nature's masterpieces we're painting with about a dozen oil colors a few unorthodox brushes and each show I'll try to show you how easy it is for you to paint and how much fun it can be so I'll tell you what let's go on up here to the canvas and get started now I've already covered the canvas with a nice thin even coat of liquid white the liquid white just makes the canvas wet and slick it allows us to actually blend color right on the canvas and it really makes our painting much much simpler than traditional methods so I tell you what let's start out and hammer on all the colors across the screen that you need at home to paint along with me and they'll come across in the same order as I have mona palette starting with a white and working around and while they're doing that let's go on up here and let's get started we'll do a let's just do a happy little scene today I'll show you a very simple scene that you can do and you'll enjoy let's start off today with an old 2 inch brush and go right into right into a small amount of the phthalo blue it doesn't take a great deal just a little and just tap a little color into the bristles but tapping that assures a nice even distribution of color all the way through the bristles there we go let's go right on up here now let's start right up at the top and we use little crisscross strokes just making little X's and go all the way across the top see their dad easy that's all you have to do now the blue in your brush is continually continually mixing with a liquid white that's already on the canvas so that way it blends automatically as you work downward and in a landscape it should always get lighter toward the horizon that helps create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting there we go just little crisscross strokes like so okay maybe about down like that now thought today would put a happy little cloud in the sky if you're gonna put clouds in the sky then you might want to make you sky a tiny bit darker so the clouds will stand out you need the dark in order for a light to show against it there okay now very gently I'll just go all the way across and that just removes the brushstrokes and brings everything together that easy we have a we have a very nice little sky tell you what while we have that blue and brush them go right back into my phthalo blue i'ma reach right next door here and grab the least little touch of the phthalo green very small amount doesn't take much it's very strong very strong okay let's go back up here now maybe maybe we'll have a little water in this painting so start from the outside and pull inward pull it across like so pull across there we go see if you start here and go across it leaves a big distinct line which is very hard to blend out so come from the outside in and that way you don't have a distinct line and this little area that's left in here if everything works just right it'll look just like little sheen of light coming across your water when you're all finished okay and you can take a little bit this color bounce it back up here in the sky if you have some left on the brush it doesn't matter the big thing that we try to teach you here is to enjoy what you're doing and to have fun painting should make you happy should make you happy okay let's wash the brush that might be the most fun part of this whole technique we wash our brushes with odorless thinner shake them off have a box down here and I just shake the brush into the box and hmm and beat the devil out of it now with a nice clean dry brush let's go right back over this and just blend it together the light spot will remain and you're painting it you don't have to worry about it'll stay there and you can blend the sky to whatever degree that you wanted okay Adam yes that's just to knock off any excess paint that's on the brush it's easier than cleaning it we said we'd have a happy little cloud in this painting so we'll use a fan brush today you could do this with a over the 1 inch brush or 2 inch brush I just picked up the fan brush so let's try that load a lot of the titanium white into it it's a very firm paint and use just the corner of the brush and just make little circles just happy little circles little tiny circles see they're little tiny circles there they're deciding the flue right on off the club right on off the canvas you have to make big decisions this piece of canvas is your world and you have to decide you have to decide where things live in your world because you have unlimited power here you can do anything that you want to do anything that you want to do there you're only restricted here by your imagination okay watch out for ambush let me just try the fan brush on a paper towel now back to our 2 inch brush we'll take just the top corner and we're going to blend the base of the clouds out tiny little circles using just the top corner of the brush then grab it and fluff it tease it pull it up a little and then very lightly very lightly three hairs and some air just go across and that easy you built a beautiful little cloud same thing over here just the corner of the brush just a stir it up a little lift it left it and then blend it there you go and that quick you have a couple of happy little clouds that live in your sky let's build us a little mountain today for that I'll use some Prussian blue we'll take a little midnight black some Van Dyke Brown little lizard crimson what the heck what the heck main thing we're looking for here is a good dark color pull it out as flat as you can get it just really really exert some force go straight down with a knife there cut across and we get a tiny rule of paint right on the edge of the knife now then this is where you have to make a big decision or does your mountain will live maybe in our world our mountains gonna live does now right there with a firm pressure firm pressure push that paint right into the fabric there we go just right into the fabric act like you're trying to push a hole through you're not gonna hurt it it's strong very strong okay Madden maybe there's another little bump there and you decide whatever you want to scrape off all the excess paint you can hear how hard I'm scraping there really get into get tough foot there we go okay now we'll take our two inch brush and we want to grab it and pull it down I'm still applying a great deal of pressure here grab it pull firmly downward that helps create that illusion of mist at the base of your mountain there we go see there that's all there is to it just give it a pull and by using the shadows and highlight shapes here that are created by the brush you can lay out your entire Mountain for that ever being committed there we go see you just lay them out and change them and move them that's a super way that if we need to cheat a little bit and there's no such thing as cheating and painting if it works for you and it makes you feel good then it's just right there we are let's wash the brush shake it up and through here we have the strangest strangest looking camera man in television all of them have these weird colored freckles then we'll take just titanium white pull it out flat take cut across and once again our small roll of paint it's so important to load that knife correctly go right up here touch no pressure no pressure there just let the knife float just let it float right down the side of the mountain but no pressure if you apply a lot of pressure it's gonna look just like your icing a cake you're not going to have all this this breaking in there the holes left in it the other problem that people experience a great deal is they use a paint that's too thin if you use a thin paint it's just going to turn to mud and then you're going to be unhappy with me and I really I really want this to work for you get a paint it's very dry and very firm that's most most important adding four we get too far along get carried away here just put a little shadow now I'll just take a little bit of the little bit a blue blue little white there just makes it like so pull it out once again our little roll of paint that's so important now grab in here no pressure once again no pressure let that nicest flows see there and we put the shadow color in the opposite or opposing direction from the highlight maybe right up in here there see there and then fantastic that you can build a mountain that easy and you really can really care every day I get letters from people all over the country who never never in their life suspected they could paint such beautiful paintings and just watching the different shows that we've put on they're doing fantastic works absolutely fantastic and the more you practice the easier it becomes and the better you get if there's a secret to this tile paint or any style of painting it's practice that's all there's no big mysteries here we show you how to do it all you need to do is just practice a little okay make sure your brush is good and dry and now we want to help create that illusion to finesse down here all we're doing is tapping just tapping following the angles and lifting up reading see they're just tap to the face of it and give it a little little upward lift over here all of these angles there and sometimes you can take have a little fun maybe take a little blue in the brush now watch here look at the power gap you can bring that mountain right around see there you can make it greater in corners and it helps create a little more interest in your mountain of course we're not interested in that happy but if you're out selling paintings this is this is what what will sell your painting these little extras makes your painting special there we go it created another plane in that mountain brought it forward and you can do all kinds of little tricks like it's just practice a little bit in just a few days if you won't believe you just absolutely won't believe what you can do okay let's go back to bowl fan brush I'm gonna go right into this old dark color that I used to to make the mountain let's see that was some black and some pression blue and some Van Dyck Brown there we go okay let's add a little SAP green to that too what the heck there we are okay load the brush full of paint both sides full of paint now maybe back in here there's a little trees that live far away there they're happy little trees that live in the distance there so take the brush and all you have to do is tap down see there hope you can see that alright now that we just you have to make some decisions here where they live where they live in your world this is one of the easiest nicest most effective ways that I've ever been ever seen to make the indication of a lot of little trees live far away even if you've never pay him before certainly this is a snap you can do this there and maybe look at there there they come when you're painting in this technique you just sort of you let your imagination go such a mind wander because you can create any illusion that you want just let your mind think of things and and off you go there and I'm taffy quite firmly here you know at the beginning of the show I said something about drag up yoli's II chaired and relaxed with me I had a letter from a fantastic lady and she told me each week when the show comes on in her area she drags up her Oh easy chair and she's gonna set and watch the show and every week without fail she falls asleep and she says by the time she wakes up I finished the painting and go and left her there in a chair by herself but you know whether whether you awaken refreshed or you paint along with us either way I hope you enjoyed this as much as I enjoy being here with you there all I'm doing here is taking that color and pulling it straight down and to create a little reflection knock off the excess paint and go gently gently across and we have instant reflections now I've had several little fan brushes going here so I don't like to spend all my time washing them so I'm gonna go into will take a little yellow reach up here get a little SAP green load the brush full of color a lot of color go right back up here maybe back in here this a little grassy areas it live it's take give it a little upward push bend the bristles push up see there okay we can make just the indication to have some little grassy things that live back here in the distance wherever you want them they're just all kinds of little projections you touch really yellow over here and there to land in yellow whatever okay and then let's take our knife and touch of the liquid white I'm gonna put it on the canvas or on the pallet there we go and cut across it back to that let's go out up here and with that let's just cut in the indication of a little water line as to wherever keep these lines basically straight all right look like you look like your water's going to run right off the side of the canvas we don't want that to happen so you can create all kind of little little places where there this is where the big trout hides back in here there and when you're painting make up little stories in your mind think about think about the big fish that lives here and maybe maybe this is in the far north maybe this little beaver that comes along here and has fun just make up little stories and yes people might think you're little touched but painters are loud they're loud to be different so enjoy that it really helps your painting if you if in your own mind that's your world and you can relate to it there we go mixing up a big bunch of dark here the same things the blue black brown little crimson you know same colors let's just stay with the old fan brush that you could once again you could do this with any brush load a lot of paint into it let's go back up here maybe in our world their lives I think evergreen tree just start off by touching the canvas now just a corner of the brush I just sort of let this work back and see there once again you can do this very nicely with a one or two inch brush bring it to a chisel edge it works just as well I just had a dirty fan brush so thought I'd use it today there but it's up to you totally totally up to you then brush maybe it's more detailed into it there have them load the brush again a lot of paint and it should be very very dark you need we're gonna put some highlights on there so you need this to be dark to the highlights of show let's give him a friend you know me if you paint with me before I think everything needs a friend even the trees and the bushes and everything friends are that important there we go I painted probably twenty thirty thousand paintings now and I'm still fascinated it still it gets you excited to see how how it works and you have to try it to understand there we go they're just back and forth back and forth think about the little Leone's on this tree leave some leaves some places in here for the by the birds to set birds have to have a place to set alright okay this and here we can do anything we want just because we're going to separate all that with with highlights brush is too slow let's get let's get serious let's take your will to inspiration go right through that same color pull the brush in one direction one direction through the paint by pulling it in one direction it'll round one corner and that rounded corner we want to the top take with a rounded corner up give it a little push and watch here see when you push look at all those little leaves and grass indications and Bush indications it makes just automatically there we go now turn the brush to create shape there think about each individual bush give them names if you want to there's one named Arthur there's Fred whatever it takes but each one of these is an individual with his own personality begin thinking about him building his shape there and let's say people may look at you like you're a little a little different but that's re us painters as you know we're happier than most people so it's okay so okay now then I'm gonna go back to my fan brush and take some SAP green a lot of SAP green a little bit of the yellow okay let's go let's go right up here now then I'm just going to take just use a corner of the brush and put in the indication here and there of some highlights not too much I want these trees to remain quite dark quiet dark don't want to lose that contrast and the mountain shows that your lights coming from the right so put more emphasis on the right side of this tree there we go darker darker darker as it works down cuz it there's more shadows toward the bottom of the tree plus that Oldham's are not as bright and shinies into it they're just right into net now maybe maybe we want the indication here and there of some sticks and twigs now this is all you have to do just take the knife scrape right through the paint and allow some of the canvas to show through most of this post these little twigs will be covered before we get finished but the ones that show through here people will thank you work for weeks with your little one haired brush puts all that detail in there and that's our secret we don't tell me one different okay maybe a couple over here wherever you want to just sort of just sort of make a decision drop them in let's use the old one-inch brush day we put some highlights in here one of our golden rules a thin paint will stick to a thick paint so we start with the thickest paint imaginable when we when we put it on the canvas now when I start highlighting this I want a thinner paint these yellows are made to a thinner consistency intentionally so they'll stick easy I even dip the brush into a small amount of the liquid white to thin the paint even more pull this in one direction load a lot of paint look at the end of this brush look at all the paint is in there probably the most common mistake made is not putting enough paint into the bristles a lot of color a lot of color it's heavy you can feel it let's go ahead up here now you have to start making big decisions in here pick out individual bushes and stuff and tree okay give a little push gentle it does not does not take a hard hit if you've loaded the brush correctly with a nice thin paint then all you have to do is just touch and it won't turn the butter see there one individual bush alright you got it now you got it now there we go now begin picking them out one at a time one at a time - here they come they're there I will pick up some Indian yellow and maybe right on the tip of the bristles a little touch of the bright red and we can put a bush out here that has a little red flowers on it see they're that easy you can do anything out here anything one bush at a time there we go see we got the ones that are father's - way first now we can come back and begin putting some that are closer to us work in layers doing the most distant object first and working forward always working forward there we go layer after layer I tell you what tell you what look at that let's have some fun maybe in our world here there's a big old trout lives out here you got to have a way to go get him so let's build us a little path and for that we'll take the knife a little touch of Van Dyck Brown pull it out very flat cut across and our little roll of paint again always that little roll of paint and go right up here you have to make a big decision now where's your path live maybe it comes right around and all I'm doing is just applying some brown paint to put the general basic shape of the path in it allow it to get larger and larger and larger as it gets closer to you that'll make it look like there's distance there let's take some dark sienna a little bit of white mix that up but don't over mix it just sort of leave it a little Marbley looking see they're all different colors our little roll of pain again go back up here and barely touching just let it graze just let it barely graze see there that Gray's want is blue that's nice gives you cold chills it works so well there we are look at that see you can do that there we are let's take now then we want to push that path down to the painting there oh you got to do let's bring some of those bushes right over it okay man let's go to the other side of the path maybe over here lives there he is it's a happy little tree that lives right here and he hangs out right over the path he just moves here sort of hangs out sees it now that path disappears back here in the bushes we don't know where it goes we don't know that's a private little place back there so where the little rabbit hides and he has fun mr. and Miss rabbit lived there there that little bush it hangs over right there right there and he's got her for it lives here like there there we her there okay now then we can take just a clean knife and just go around and scraping the indication of some little trunks and sticks and twigs and see there that helps show distance in your painting shows different planes and creates that illusion of depth so these really help and I know then take our liner brush a little paint thinner on it maybe a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown we want this color to be as thin as ink let's go right up here maybe he lives just a little stick here and you could put a few of these in wherever you wanna see there just add a little excitement while I have that brush I want to add a little bit of red and I think I'll sign this painting there we are then painters there in this ink and with that I think we'll call this painting finished and from all of us here I really hope you've enjoyed it so happy painting and God bless I'll see you next time I you
