hi I'm glad to see you again today thought today we'd do something a little bit different I have mold canvas up here as usual but I've covered the day with a thin even coat of liquid clear and let me say it again thin coat you need very very little of this and this is nice when you want to use colors that are say transparent and you want to get sort of a different effect so I tell you what let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started I'm gonna start today with a small amount of Indian yellow just the least little amount on the 2 inch brush just just tap a little color in there let's make a nice little I like a little sunset back here like so we'll just start and just drag a little color across like it you know since we introduced those the clear oh I don't know several series back we've got so many letters people are doing such fantastic paintings with it and I've used it mainly for seascapes and the letters are asking can we can we do landscapes and stuff with it absolutely absolutely so today I want to show you how you can do a fantastic put a landscape using the clear right into crimson alizarin crimson still using the same brush have not washed it okay I'm go right up above the yellow and just begin laying that in the color was still yellow in the brush you're gonna get a nice oranjee color beautiful loot color we're gonna blend it down into the yellow these colors are very transparent so you get some beautiful effects I'm gonna get just a touch more of the the crimson on my brush here like so but you need very very very small amount of this liquid clear can't say that enough times that's probably the biggest single mistake made is putting too much of it on the canvas one jar oh my gosh you last you for years I'm just gonna add a little bit of that same color down here into the water like that whatever we put in the sky will add a little into the water to just sort of blend that together tell you what I'm gonna do I'm going to add a little bit more crimson because now we wiped most of the yellow out of brush I sort of look a little a little more into the red issue I want it to be a little brighter right above that so we have just layers of different colors very pleasing nice little colors right there just a little touch more and with this ladies wander on up into the sky wherever you want it that takes very very little color when you're using transparent colors on top of the clear very little color on the brush now they're a little bit more down here too it's a little brighter in the sky should get a little brighter in this water now that I have him gonna go into they little blue I have not washed the brush yet they little blue of each up here and grab a little two crimson very little crimson just enough to give it a slight lavender you with very blue yet very blue you just drop a little bit of that off this little blue is very transparent there okay I'll just break it down to about like it and let it stop same thing now we'll put some into the water just to have some in the water and I'm not sure who we're gonna have lamb down here yet but it doesn't matter cuz you can put the land right over this color and wherever you want it that's where it'll be okay there will get another brush I have several of each brush and then with a good dry brush we will blend this together this is very dry sure it's good and dry because the clear and paint thinner will react quite violently so be sure your brushes dries you can get it might even wipe it across a paper towel before you do this there we go okay now that what's really neat after you have all these transparent colors on top of the clear is to begin adding little layers of opaque color and titanium white for example is very opaque so let me show you here we'll take the the old knife pull the paint out very flat and just cut across get us a little roll of paint and let's put let's put some little streaky clouds back here all you have to do it just rub it across a canvas just rub all there is to it whatever you want a little roll of paint that's all you need anyway get us some happy little clouds very lightly you couldn't blend those see how that opaque cover those stands out against the all the transparent colors and you can take the large brush and maybe in here you want to put the indication of a little little cloud is just sort of floating around just take the brush and very quickly drop it in it's unreal what you can do with this can make some of the most beautiful and striking effects okay have it today let's build a sir let's build us a mountain I'm gonna start with black and Van Dyke Brown a little bit of Prussian blue in it so high compression blue Van Dyke Brown should be very dark mostly black okay once again we cut off that little roll of paint it's great up here now then let's have a big mountain that lives there he goes right about here they let him drop down see there you're just putting wherever you want it very dark oh and the only thing you worried about is this nice outside it you could care less what's happening inside here we're just letting the flow right on off here big son of a gun really push that right into the fabric right into the fabric scrape off all the excess paint just scrape it okay now then take a large brush grab this and pull it because it's wet because it clear is on here it'll move just let it blend downward this removes excess paint and also gives the illusion that there's mist at the base of this mountain I just lay it whatever I don't know we don't know where he goes don't know to care where you want it to go just take the brush and tap okay now then let's put some highlights on there I'm going to take go take some dark Sienna clean off a little spot here but take dark see ya take some bright red and I reach up here to get some white and pull it through add a little yellow ochre just but add all these colors sort of in layers here see don't over mix it let all kind of things happen okay now that when you cut across there all those different things will be right in that role of paint all these different colors if you just cut straight across they're still there and you can come right up here no pressure and you can just lay them all along here like this all kinds of little different things are happening in there all kinds of beautiful beautiful colors that easy put some up here on this big son of a gun I don't come down wherever you on it there see just let all these things happen people will think you work for months to get all these different colors and it's all in the loading of the knife all in the loading it happens automatically you don't even have to worry about it get the small knife gonna go over the other side for I do too much here we're putting some putting some shadows I'll take some Prussian blue little touch of white into it and let's go right up here get a little bit of dark Sienna in there too and just pull it down Prussian blue dark sienna and I'm not mixing these very much don't want them to what I'm hardly a mixed at all just pull down okay maybe they do it that way right in here a little bit more see that simple but in all kinds of beautiful beautiful striking little highlights maybe right here we'll have this one come right on down they'll have a little projection here and where this sort of little meet director just wherever you want to just sort of work your colors back and forth they don't come together come together like so but you can make some of the most fantastic little effects and they just sort of happen just sort of happened bring us maybe right on around just make up your Mountain the way you want it there we go let's take a little bit of light color maybe the lights really the zinging right through there please all in that dark area it's a super way though to make some of the most beautiful little mountain backside you've ever seen okay that gives us a pretty nice little mountain let me find a clean dry two inch brush and I just want to tap the base of this mountain I want to create the illusion of mist down here so all you need to do is just tap it to happen following the angles and then gently lift it upward gently gently gently I always follow those angles though it's most important and that'll create the illusion of mist at the base of that mountain yeah then let's take we use that same same basic old mountain of color it's black and blue a little brown in a very dark though should look black okay continue to pull it out flat get our little roll of paint or ad out on the edge and maybe here let's do this let's get brave today maybe this big son of a gun just comes right on down a little bump right there just sort of let it go very dark I want this to almost be black very dark and we'll play some games with contrast here now if you had the liquid white on the canvas when you've done this it would dilute your color would not be near it is dark and I want this to be very very dark it should look black okay now I'll grab that and just pull it is very rich then I'm gonna take Prussian blue and white but mixed very very dark I want very dark I had a little black to that they're very dark cut off a little bit of paint yeah I just want to put the indication here just here and there that maybe a little light is striking this whole dark dark mountain but there's virtually nothing there it is very dark just a little shadow here and there on it I don't know if that'll show up early there we go hmm you know then while we have that dark color on the brush let's make us a little reflection underneath that we're gonna need a reflection so all we have to do is just grab a little of that and pull it down with straight down straight down just like so straight down straight down straight down and very lightly just come across you can push that paint and make those reflections wiggle when I move okay now maybe behind a fan brush maybe back here we'll take some yellows some yellows and I'll get into some greens dark green here dark dark green maybe there's some little land areas back in here this is a very dark green just push these in Jerez pushing it now go back into the same yellow color and just add a little more to the brush and it'll be lighter a little yellow ocher cad yellow Indian yellow okay let's go back add in I want to come back in here and just put the indication of a few little highlights these are distant little trees and bushes at a far away can't make out a lot of detail on these they're just enough to make them shine a little bit yeah we will take a little brown and just put in the indication of a little bit of land this Van Dyck Brown right along in there take a little bit of the liquid white pull it out very flat and where that then come right in here and cut us in a water line see how that stands out dark against light contrast all this wild contrasts take a fan brush this is a number three fan brush how many melfi's will show i just want to put the indication here and there about just an evergreen tree just a few right in there when you do them at home though you'll be able to see them much better just a little evergreens back in there okay tell you what let's really have some fun now take the old two-inch brush and go right into Van Dyck Brown pick up some alizarin crimson a little bit of dark Sienna just whatever leave them a little SAP green just throw it all in there together tap some color in there all right let's have right in here let's have some beautiful beautiful little bushes and trees just tap use the corner of the brush and tap quite firmly maybe these son of a gun it's just there they go go right on off the top of that canvas here right over my mountain and begin making some nice branches and limbs we were right into a little touch of yellow ochre and just begin mixing that right on the canvas and the brush wanted to get a little lighter toward the top there and this is the back of the tree we paint the fact of the tree they will come back and paint the middle of the tree which is a trunk and then we'll put the highlights on okay when I came to a little more in the brown I have to start making some big decisions here where do you want you to lay out to go maybe it goes right out here like that just wherever maybe out through there just decide where you want it and drop it in pull that straight down a little bit go across give us the indication of a happy little reflection and maybe maybe over here on the other side maybe there's some more over here same colors Brown little bit alizarin crimson there just whatever you got good dark color maybe there'll be a little reflection here too okay yeah then let's come back in here and we need a we need a tree trunk or two some will go right into Van Dyck Brown with a fan brush right in there and back in here back in here we'll make some a few little trunks we don't know how many trunks are back here and you maybe can only see parts of them here and there just wherever maybe just happen this one right here comes down and you know me you know me I like he's old big trees there's one June just throw him in and he's got a friend here this friend this friend is a really a big tree he lives a little further into the foreground big son of a gun that'll sort of give you an idea for you trees live maybe tell you what tell you maybe there's one or two on the other side over here we can just sort of block them in all we have the little brush boy there's one there's one day it comes soup that easy it would give him a friend there just like so yeah then go back to a two inch brush I'm just gonna tap it into some of the greens and the yellows and Indian yellow yellow ocher just tap it just have it okay now then let's begin putting all terms of just little grassy things that are growing out here wherever you want wherever there's one tell you what let's do must have some nice rocks I live up here too we need a nice stone it lives there yes nice big old stolen and in your world you decide where all these little rocks and stones live and just drop them in just put them in whatever you wanna give a little little touch a highlight up here oh that's pretty pretty thanks oh there's some right there see how easy it is to make all these little rocks okay maybe we want someone to yeah we can't leave this side that will put a big one right out here lives out here on the corner he watches and sees what happens out here there we go put some highlights on him it's a little Brady shiny thanks out there there it's the same color as we were used on the mountain just sort of mixed on the knife sort of that I'm happen okay like I'll pick a a one-inch brush here let me get a one inch brush going to a little touch of a little touch of the liquid white right into some of my yellows and greens pull that brush in one direction a lot a lot of paint on it okay let's use that and come up here what's on bright sparkling little bushes and use it side words and just push these Rascals in wherever you want maybe there's some head back in here these are a little darker not as much lights gonna hit them back in here see they had just bring them down so they cover up the edges of your rock I couldn't look finished and all I'm doing is just pushing up with a side and work working layers completing the most distant layer and coming forward maybe there's another big stone that lives here see there yes a little light on him maybe there's even a little blue on this side here to make a shadow dad easy okay then we could put some little grassy things down here his foots school bring the other side and do that over here too yeah that's a nice one just wherever you think they should live and get carried away and cover up all your little rocks and stones also be careful yeah they would go back into our liquid white put us in a little water line in here just like so see it cleans up all the edges and brings it all together if you don't have the clear you could certainly do this with liquid white it'll look a little bit different because your color won't be as transparent but it will certainly certainly work just scratch it a few little sticks and twigs here and there yeah then tell you what let's take these big old trees here just put the indication of some bark out here touch it sort of pull it round give it a little round pull just like so that's so same same same old mountain colors I'm still using them here here there maybe a little bright coloring here or the light striking I mean let's go over there the sight don't want these little trees left out we'll put a little color on them too now they'll stand out against those dark dark colors in the background it's fantastic I thought you'd like this and it it shows you this thing what you can do using the clear okay take a little little thinner or you could use the liquid clear we put some clear on the brush in but you want to thin this paint down and hearing there let's just put a little stick or twig or whatever there we go yeah then let's put some limbs out here but then I'm gonna use I'll use liquid black today we'll take the black I'll just put a little on the palate and let's come right in here and begin drawing in a few little branches on this black is thin it'll flow that's liquid black and just however many you want on your tree I hope you can see that hope my hand is not in the way don't show much over that dark but we know they're there you'd add a little touch of light to get them to pop right out okay back over here in our big old tree Oh big lamb it comes out through here like it wherever you want wherever there comes another one back in here just a few indicate a few they had it cain't let's take one dip my brush into it a small amount of the clear and I'm gonna go right into yellow ocher tap a little bit of the bright red just tap it can't I want to put indication of some little leaves out here they come all in front of the tree just like so see there and you can just make thousands of little leaves just with a corner of the big two-inch brush and you put them wherever you want that's super really hope you've enjoyed this one think we'll call it finished see what you can do with a liquid clear and from all of us here happy painting and God bless you
