HI. WELCOME BACK. CERTAINLY GLAD YOU COULD
JOIN US TODAY. I THOUGHT TODAY WE'D
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, SINCE THIS IS THE LAST SHOW
OF THE 21st SERIES. AND TODAY, LET'S START OUT
AND HAVE THEM RUN ALL THE COLORS ACROSS THE SCREEN THAT YOU NEED
TO PAINT ALONG WITH ME. WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT, COME ON UP HERE,
BECAUSE THIS IS CRAZY. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I'VE DONE. I'VE TAKEN A LITTLE
CON-TACT PAPER CUTOUT TODAY, JUST ADHESIVE-BACKED PAPER, AND I'VE CUT A LITTLE MAP
OF FLORIDA. SINCE I LIVE IN FLORIDA,
I THOUGHT TODAY WE'D DO FLORIDA. THE TOP OF IT I'VE COVERED
WITH LIQUID WHITE, AND THE BOTTOM HERE I'M--I'M
COVERING WITH JUST LIQUID CLEAR, AND I'VE PUT A LITTLE COLOR
RIGHT IN HERE. NOW, THE ONE THING THAT I DID DO BEFORE I PUT
THE CON-TACT PAPER ON IS I SPRAYED THE WHOLE CANVAS
A LIGHT BABY BLUE COLOR, AND YOU CAN SPRAY IT
ANY COLOR YOU WANT IT. AND I JUST PICKED FLORIDA TODAY
SINCE THAT'S WHERE I LIVE. YOU COULD ACTUALLY DO THIS
FOR ANY STATE THAT YOU LIVE IN. IN FACT, WE'RE--MAYBE WE'LL HAVE
A SERIES THAT EACH WEEK WE'LL DO A DIFFERENT STATE,
AND WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT, AND SOMETHING THAT GOES ALONG
WITH THAT STATE. BUT TODAY,
LET'S START WITH THAT ONE. I'M GONNA START OUT TODAY WITH
THE LEAST LITTLE TOUCH OF YELLOW OCHRE,
JUST A VERY SMALL AMOUNT ON THE OLD TWO-INCH BRUSH. LET'S GO RIGHT UP IN HERE
AND LET'S JUST DO A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FLORIDA SCENE
THAT SHOULD MAKE YOU HAPPY. THERE WE ARE. JUST PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF THAT YELLOW RIGHT IN THERE, AND LET IT BLEND UPWARD. AND I'LL GO RIGHT UP HERE, TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF ALIZARIN CRIMSON, AND PUT THAT ACROSS THERE, AND JUST SORT OF LET THEM
BLEND TOGETHER. MAYBE WE'LL LET
THIS PINKISH COLOR-- OH, MAYBE WE'LL LET IT GO
WAY ON UP FROM HERE LIKE SO. NOW, WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS
AT HOME, TO GET A DESIGN-- AND YOU COULD USE ANY DESIGN
THAT YOU WANT-- JUST TAKE AND--AND PROJECT IT
ONTO A PIECE OF CON-TACT PAPER AND TRACE IT AND CUT IT OUT. VERY EASY. I USE SOMETHING LIKE
AN EXACTO KNIFE OR-- OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
OR A PAIR OF SCISSORS, WHATEVER. I USE AN EXACTO KNIFE, BUT
A PAIR OF SCISSORS WOULD WORK, AND YOU CAN CUT
JUST ABOUT ANY DESIGN THAT THE MIND CAN IMAGINE. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL JUST LET THAT BLEND
RIGHT DOWN A LITTLE BIT INTO THAT YELLOWISH COLOR, SOMETHING LIKE SO. WE'LL DO A LITTLE
SUNSET THING TODAY. OK, TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF LAVENDER HERE. WE'LL USE A LITTLE PHTHALO BLUE
AND ALIZARIN CRIMSON, PROPORTIONATELY MUCH MORE
CRIMSON THAN--THAN BLUE. MAYBE RIGHT HERE
AT THE WATER LINE, WE'LL PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF LAVENDER COLOR... HMM, SOMETHING ABOUT LIKE THAT. DON'T WANT TO LOSE
ALL THAT YELLOW, BUT WANT A LITTLE LAVENDER
RIGHT AT THE WATER. NOW, I HAVE LIQUID CLEAR
FROM HERE DOWN. AND THEN IN HERE, I'VE JUST PUT
A LITTLE LAVENDER IN HERE, A LITTLE PHTHALO BLUE,
AND LAVENDER. THERE WE ARE. WE'LL MAKE A VERY SIMPLE
LITTLE SEASCAPE IN HERE, BECAUSE TO ME, THAT SORT OF
REPRESENTS FLORIDA. EVERYBODY COMES TO FLORIDA
TO ENJOY THE OCEAN. WE'LL SHAKE THIS OLD BRUSH... [CHUCKLES] AND JUST BEAT THE DEVIL
OUT OF IT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE A LITTLE FAN BRUSH. LET'S MAKE US SOME MORE
OF THAT LAVENDER COLOR. THAT'S A NICE COLOR. WE'LL USE SOME ALIZARIN CRIMSON
AND PHTHALO BLUE. A LITTLE PHTHALO BLUE
RIGHT THERE LIKE SO. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THAT SHOULD BE GOOD
FOR WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. AND LET'S GO RIGHT UP IN HERE,
AND MAYBE--MAYBE WE HAVE SOME LITTLE CLOUDS
THAT LIVE RIGHT UP IN HERE. AND WE CAN MAKE THOSE
JUST--JUST BY-- NOW, I'M EXAGGERATING, BUT MAKING A SHAPE LIKE THAT,
SORT OF-- AND JUST SORT OF DECIDE WHERE
YOUR LITTLE CLOUDS LIVE HERE. MAYBE THEY GO ALL THE WAY OUT
AND GET LIGHTER AND LIGHTER OUT IN HERE. THERE. HOWEVER. YOU DECIDE HOW THEY GO. JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU
HOW TO DO IT, THEN TURN YOU LOOSE
ON THE WORLD. THERE. HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THIS SERIES. WITH THE COMPLETION OF THIS ONE,
THERE'S--LET'S SEE-- 200--273 HALF-HOUR SHOWS NOW. WHEW! GOOD GRACIOUS, GETTING TO WHERE
MY MATH DOESN'T GO HIGH ENOUGH TO FIGURE IT OUT. AND IF YOU'VE ENJOYED THE SHOWS
AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM AGAIN OR YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE
ONES MAYBE THAT YOU'VE MISSED, GIVE YOUR STATION A CALL. LET THEM KNOW THAT
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THEM, BECAUSE THEY'RE AVAILABLE
TO THEM. THERE. MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE
FLOATER RIGHT ALONG HERE. OK, MAYBE--SHOOT, MAYBE
IT COMES RIGHT ON OUT HERE. WE DON'T KNOW. JUST SORT OF
LET THESE THINGS HAPPEN. PUT ONE RIGHT IN THERE. MAYBE THERE'S EVEN A LITTLE
STREAKY ONE RIGHT IN LIKE THAT. OK, BACK TO OUR BIG BRUSH. BE SURE IT'S GOOD AND DRY,
AND VERY GENTLY, DOWN HERE WE'LL JUST
BLEND THAT SORT OF ACROSS, LITERALLY PULL THAT PAINT. SINCE IT'S WET, YOU CAN MOVE IT. UP IN HERE,
FOLLOW THE BASIC ANGLES, AND VERY LIGHTLY,
JUST BLEND THAT OUT. AND YOU CAN BLEND IT
TO ANY DEGREE OF SOFTNESS THAT YOU WANT, OR YOU CAN
LEAVE LITTLE THINGS IN IT. SOMETIMES--SOMETIMES I GO BACK,
ADD A LITTLE MORE OF THE BLUE TO THE SAME LAVENDER COLOR. PUT A LITTLE MORE OF THE BLUE
TO THE BLUE SIDE, LOAD THE OLD FAN BRUSH
FULL OF COLOR. LET'S GO BACK UP HERE. AND MAYBE HERE AND THERE,
PUT THE INDICATION OF SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE DARKER,
AND IT'LL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S A LITTLE CLOSER TO US. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW,
IN A LANDSCAPE OR A SEASCAPE, THINGS SHOULD GET DARKER
AS THEY COME TOWARD US. THERE. NOW WITH OUR CLEAN, DRY BRUSH,
WE'LL JUST BLEND THAT IN, AND THAT WAY, IT'LL LOOK LIKE
THERE'S SEVERAL LAYERS OF CLOUDS UP THERE
IN THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE SKY. ALL RIGHT. OK, THAT'S ABOUT ALL WE NEED
FOR A LITTLE SKY. THAT'LL GIVE US A VERY NICE ONE,
VERY EFFECTIVE. OK. NOW, THEN, WE CAN COME DOWN HERE
AND BEGIN DECIDING WHERE OUR WATER LIVES. HMM, LET ME FIND
A LITTLE FAN BRUSH. THERE IT IS. USE THE LITTLE NUMBER 3
FAN BRUSH HERE. AND I'M GONNA DO THIS ONE
BASICALLY LIKE I DO A LARGE SEASCAPE. I'M GONNA TAKE THE BRUSH
AND SORT OF DECIDE WHERE MY MAJOR WAVE WILL BE. SHOOP, UP LIKE THIS,
AND THEN MAYBE IT'LL SORT OF DROP OVER A LITTLE BIT,
AND GO RIGHT THROUGH THERE. SOMEWHERE IN THERE. MAYBE OUR LITTLE FLOATER
WILL BE IN-- RIGHT ALONG IN THERE. THERE IT IS. LET ME FIND THIS. TAKE A LINER BRUSH,
PUT A LITTLE-- LITTLE BIT
OF THE TITANIUM WHITE ON IT, AND I'M JUST GONNA TAKE THIS
AND SORT OF ROLL IT, TURN IT. AS YOU'RE GOING, LET IT TURN, AND JUST BEGIN FIGURING OUT
BASICALLY WHERE OUR LITTLE BREAKER'S
GONNA BE. THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR
AT THIS POINT. WE'LL KEEP ADDING COLOR
AND STUFF IN THERE. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE
IT'S GONNA BE AT THIS POINT. I'LL REACH UP IN HERE AND BEGIN BLENDING
A LITTLE OF THAT OUT SO THERE'S A LIGHT AREA
UNDERNEATH IT. THERE. THERE WE GO. SEE, THAT WAY, WE HAVE AN IDEA
OF WHERE OUR BREAKER'S GONNA BE. NOW, THEN,
WE CAN COME RIGHT IN HERE, GRAB THE TOP,
AND SORT OF LIFT IT OVER. THIS IS GONNA BE A TINY LITTLE
WAVE WAY BACK IN THE DISTANCE. WAY BACK THERE. THERE. ALL RIGHT. GOOD. BACK TO OUR LINER BRUSH. TAKE A LITTLE
OF THE TITANIUM WHITE, AND I'M GONNA START
BACK IN HERE, FIGURING OUT WHERE THE HORIZON
IS AND ALL THE LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. THERE. SEE ALL THOSE LITTLE DOERS? VERY EASY TO DO. I WANT THIS TO SORT OF FLOAT
RIGHT ON BACK ALMOST INTO NOTHING. OK. AND WE CAN TAKE SOME
THAT'S...REALLY BRIGHT AND HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THEM. THERE. OK. NOW, THEN. NOW, THEN, BACK TO MY
LITTLE LINER BRUSH. LET'S DO THAT ONE MORE TIME. THAT'LL GIVE US-- THAT'LL GIVE US RIGHT ALONG
WHERE THE--THE BREAKER IS HERE. AND WE CAN PULL A LITTLE OF
THAT COLOR RIGHT OVER THE TOP, BRING IT ALL TOGETHER, SOMETHING LIKE SO. NOW, THEN. LET'S GET--TAKE A LITTLE
OF THE PHTHALO BLUE A LITTLE CRIMSON, BUT MOSTLY TO THE BLUE SIDE
THIS TIME. PUT A LITTLE DARK AREA
RIGHT IN UNDERNEATH. NEED A LITTLE DARK AREA
UNDERNEATH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MAYBE IT COMES OUT
TO ABOUT THERE. NOW, THEN, I'M GONNA GO INTO A
LITTLE TOUCH OF THE DARK SIENNA. IT'S TIME WE STARTED GETTING
INTO A LITTLE LAND AREA. RIGHT THERE,
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. AND MAYBE EVEN A LITTLE BIT
OF THE VAN DYKE BROWN, BUT NOT MUCH VAN DYKE YET. JUST BEGIN LAYING IN WHERE OUR LITTLE BEACH
IS GONNA BE IN HERE. DARK SIENNA,
A LITTLE VAN DYKE JUST BRING THEM TOGETHER. MAYBE WE'LL JUST COVER UP
THE WHOLE BOTTOM OF THAT. THAT LOOKS NICE. THERE. AND I'M PUTTING A PRETTY DARK
COLOR IN HERE TO START WITH SO WHEN WE PUT LIGHTER COLORS
ON IT, IT'LL SHOW. YOU NEED THAT DARK IN ORDER
FOR THE LIGHT TO SHOW. THERE. OK. NOW, HAVE TO BEGIN DECIDING
IF WE HAVE WATER UP HERE ON THE SHORE, AND IF SO,
WHERE IT'S AT. SO WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE WHITE. I'M GONNA MIX THE LEAST,
LEAST, LEAST LITTLE TOUCH OF PHTHALO BLUE WITH IT,
BUT LEAST LITTLE TOUCH. LEAST LITTLE TOUCH. CUT OFF A TINY LITTLE BIT MORE,
LITTLE ROLL OF PAINT RIGHT OUT ON THE EDGE
OF THE KNIFE, AND MAYBE IN OUR WORLD, RIGHT ALONG IN HERE,
WE HAVE A LITTLE WATER THAT'S PLAYING RIGHT ALONG
UP HERE ON THE BEACH. SHOO. THERE. SEE THERE? NOW, TAKE A CLEAN FAN BRUSH
AND VERY GENTLY GRAB THAT. I'M JUST GONNA BLEND IT BACK,
BUT IT SHOULD GO STRAIGHT BACK SO YOUR WATER LOOKS FLAT. OTHERWISE, YOUR WATER
JUST WON'T LOOK FLAT. OK. THERE. LITTLE BIT IN THERE. NOW WE HAVE TO BEGIN THINKING
ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE WAVE THAT'S COMING OUT THROUGH THERE. AND I'M GONNA GO BACK
TO MY LITTLE BRUSH, MY LITTLE LINER BRUSH,
PUT A LITTLE PAINT THINNER, A LITTLE PHTHALO BLUE,
A LITTLE WHITE, AND NOW WE CAN BEGIN FORMING
SOME OF THESE LITTLE DUDES. JUST CREATING THE ILLUSION
OF ALL KINDS OF LITTLE-- LITTLE RIPPLES AND LITTLE--
LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE WATER,
LITTLE FOAMY MASSES. THERE. OK. MAYBE WE'LL BRIGHTEN THAT UP
A LITTLE BIT RIGHT IN THERE JUST A LITTLE,
MAKE THAT REALLY STAND OUT. OK, NOW TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE
OF THAT, FLIP THAT RIGHT OVER. OK, NOW. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST,
EASIEST WAYS OF DOING A LITTLE SEASCAPE. LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT WHITE
WITH THE LEAST, LEAST LITTLE TOUCH
OF THE PHTHALO BLUE IN IT. LEAST LITTLE TOUCH. TOUCH HERE. MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER
LITTLE WATER LINE RIGHT OUT THROUGH HERE
SOMEWHERE. AND ONCE AGAIN, WITH A CLEAN,
DRY FAN BRUSH-- HAS NO PAINT ON IT--
JUST GRAB IT AND PULL. JUST PULL IT BACK... A LITTLE LIKE THAT. THERE. AND YOU CAN TOUCH THE BASE
OF THAT, PULL IT DOWN, AND GO LIGHTLY ACROSS,
AND IT'LL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE WATER'S WET THE SAND HERE. JUST LIKE THE SAND'S WETNESS. PUT OUR EDGE BACK IN THERE. THERE. SEE? NOW WE HAVE
A LITTLE WET AREA IN THERE. OK. LITTLE WHITE,
LITTLE DARK SIENNA... AND LET'S BEGIN PUTTING IN
SOME LIGHTER COLOR SAND MAYBE RIGHT IN HERE. AND IT'S NOT SO WET;
COLOR'S A LITTLE BIT LIGHTER. SO WE'LL USE WHITE, A LITTLE--
LITTLE TOUCH OF THE DARK SIENNA, AND LET IT SNEAK
RIGHT UP IN THERE. THERE. OK. NOW... I'M GONNA TAKE THE LEAST LITTLE
BIT OF THE LAVENDER COLOR, AND RIGHT UNDER HERE--
SEE IF YOU HAVE A STEADY HAND-- UNDER THIS LINE, I'M GONNA PUT
A LITTLE LINE OF DARK COLOR... OR DARKER THAN THE WHITE. THAT'LL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
THERE'S DEPTH TO IT. AND WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THESE
LITTLE DOERS, PULL THEM BACK, JUST MAKE ALL KINDS OF
LITTLE THINGS IN THERE. THERE. AND HERE'S A LITTLE DARK COLOR
BACK IN THERE HERE AND THERE JUST TO MAKE AN INDICATION
OF THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WAVES. ALL RIGHT. GOOD. AS I SAY, IF YOU'VE MISSED
ANY OF OUR SHOWS, GIVE YOUR STATION A CALL
AND LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THEM, BECAUSE THEY ARE AVAILABLE
TO THEM WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM. AND WE'D LIKE FOR YOU TO HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THEM ALL IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO. OK, OK. I'LL JUST--RIGHT IN HERE
IT'LL BE A LITTLE LIGHTER, SO I'LL JUST ADD
A LITTLE BIT MORE WHITE. OH, YEAH, THAT'S NICE. AND MAYBE THERE'S A HAPPY LITTLE
SAND DUNE THAT LIVES HERE. SO FOR THAT,
LET'S JUST TAKE WHITE, A LITTLE DARK SIENNA. I'M GONNA BEGIN DECIDING
WHERE IT LIVES. MAYBE IT LIVES--YEP,
YOU'RE RIGHT--RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE. SHOOP. WE'LL JUST THROW IN
A LITTLE BIT OF COLOR, SOMETHING LIKE SO,
AND BLEND IT DOWN VERY LIGHTLY. THERE. OK. NOW, THEN, LET'S HAVE SOME FUN. LET'S TAKE A LITTLE
OF THE PRUSSIAN BLUE, A LITTLE SAP GREEN, MIX THEM TOGETHER AND MAKE
A DARK, DARK GREEN. MAYBE WE'LL PUT A LITTLE BLACK
INTO IT. OOH, THAT'S NICE. SEE? VERY DARK GREEN, THOUGH. AND MAYBE--MAYBE? MAYBE? YEP. THERE'S SOME LITTLE WEEDS
AND BUSHES AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT LIVE UP HERE
ON OUR SAND DUNES, AND THEY JUST SORT OF TRAVEL
RIGHT DOWN THE EDGE THERE, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OK, AND WE CAN TAKE OUR BRUSH, GRAB JUST THE BASE OF THIS
A LITTLE BIT, JUST BARELY TOUCHING IT, AND LET A LITTLE OF IT
COME TO THAT. THERE. NOW, THEN. BACK TO OUR LINER BRUSH. WE TAKE A LITTLE--
LITTLE OF THAT GREENISH COLOR WITH PAINT THINNER,
AND WE CAN BEGIN LIFTING UP SOME LITTLE WEEDS AND STICKS
AND, YOU KNOW, LITTLE SEA OATY THINGS,
WHATEVER. THERE. THERE WE GO. OK, TAKE THAT. I WANT TO GO RIGHT INTO
A LITTLE BIT OF THE YELLOW OCHRE AND DO THE SAME THING AGAIN, SO WE SORT OF HIGHLIGHT
SOME OF THOSE. THERE. YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN--AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT-- BUT IF YOU'RE EVER INTERESTED
IN SELLING PAINTINGS, THESE KIND OF LITTLE PAINTINGS
WILL REALLY SELL WELL IN-- ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE
YOU HAVE A LOT OF TOURISTS LIKE FLORIDA OR ALASKA,
PLACES LIKE THAT. BUT YOU COULD DO THIS FOR
ANY STATE, AND EVERY STATE HAS SOMETHING THAT
IT'S WELL-KNOWN FOR, AND YOU CAN--YOU CAN
FEATURE THAT IN THERE. SO TRY IT FOR YOUR STATE... OR JUST DO ANY ONE
THAT YOU WANT. NOW MAYBE--HMM. TELL YOU WHAT. MAYBE--MAYBE THERE'S
ANOTHER LITTLE DUNE COMES RIGHT ACROSS HERE. THAT'LL PUSH EVERYTHING BACK,
AND WE CAN SEE THE LITTLE GRASSY THINGS
IN THERE. JUST USING
THE NUMBER 3 FAN BRUSH HERE AND PUSHING UPWARD,
REALLY PUSHING UPWARD. TAKE A LITTLE, LITTLE TINY BIT
OF THE CAD YELLOW, LITTLE BIT OF THE YELLOW OCHRE, AND JUST PUT
A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT ON IT. DON'T WANT A GREAT DEAL,
JUST A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT. A LITTLE MORE OF THE CAD YELLOW. THERE. A LITTLE SPARKLER
HERE AND THERE. OK, I WANT TO GO BACK
TO OUR LITTLE LINER BRUSH, DO THE SAME THING AGAIN. TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THE--
OF THAT GREEN COLOR WE MADE, LIFT IT UP. AND IF I REMEMBER, THAT WAS JUST
A LITTLE SAP GREEN, A LITTLE BLACK,
A LITTLE PRUSSIAN BLUE. THERE. AND JUST FLIP
THEM LITTLE THINGS UP. GIVE THEM A LITTLE FLIP. ZOOM! AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE LITTLE SEA OATS, YOU CAN JUST GRAB THE END OF IT
AND PUT LITTLE-- LITTLE DOERS ON THE END
OUT THERE. OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, IN FLORIDA,
SEA OATS ARE GETTING SORT OF RARE, AND I THINK
EVERYBODY'S SORT OF PICKED THEM TILL NOW THEY DON'T EVEN LET YOU
GET CLOSE TO THEM HARDLY. EVERYBODY SEEMS TO WANT
TO TAKE THEM HOME. ALL RIGHT, A LITTLE BIT
OF THE YELLOW OCHRE. A LITTLE YELLOW OCHRE, AND WE'LL
COME BACK AND SORT OF HIGHLIGHT A LITTLE OF THOSE WHEREVER. THERE. JUST A FEW OF THEM. OK. SHOOT, NO FLORIDA SCENE WOULD BE
COMPLETE WITHOUT A LITTLE "M" BIRD IN IT. EVERYBODY PUTS LITTLE--
LITTLE SEABIRDS IN THERE. SO FOR THAT,
TAKE A LITTLE PAINT THINNER. I USE A LITTLE BLACK. A LITTLE BLACK. AND TAKE ONE SIDE THROUGH
A LITTLE BIT OF WHITE, AND WE CAN GO UP IN HERE AND--
PSHEW, PSHEW--THERE. NOW WE'VE GOT A LITTLE--
A LITTLE "M" BIRD. THAT'S WHAT I CALL THEM, BECAUSE
THEY'RE VERY SIMPLE TO MAKE. IT'S LIKE MAKING LITTLE Ms. GIVE HIM A FRIEND, AND MAYBE WAY BACK THERE,
THERE'S A THIRD ONE... I THINK THAT ONE
GOT A BROKE WING. [CHUCKLES] SOMEBODY SHOT HIM
ON THE WAY OVER--PCHOON! NOW, THEN, MOMENT OF TRUTH. LET'S TAKE THIS OFF
AND SEE WHAT WE HAVE, SEE IF IT WORKED OUT ALL RIGHT. WHEN WE REMOVE
THE CON-TACT PAPER, THOUGH... ISN'T THAT GORGEOUS? AND AS I SAY, YOU COULD DO THIS
WITH ANY STATE THAT YOU WANTED TO. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FLORIDA. IT JUST SO HAPPENS, AS I SAY,
THAT I'M LIVING IN FLORIDA RIGHT NOW,
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD DO A-- A TRIBUTE TO THE STATE
THAT I'M LIVING IN. BUT WHEN I LIVED IN ALASKA,
I USED TO DO THESE WITH THE STATE OF ALASKA. IN FACT, SOMETIMES I WOULD EVEN
CUT THE STATE OF ALASKA OUT OF WOOD AND PAINT LITTLE
SCENES FROM ALASKA ON IT. WE WOULD SELL THEM
TO THE TOURIST. AND, UH, AS I SAY, WE'RE NOT
INTERESTED IN MAKING MONEY, BUT IF YOU ARE, IT'S ONE
OF THE NEATEST LITTLE WAYS OF DOING SOME FANTASTIC
LITTLE PAINTINGS. AND YOU CAN GET CARRIED AWAY
WITH THIS SOMETIME. GET CARRIED AWAY. WE'LL TAKE A LITTLE BROWN,
DARK SIENNA, VAN DYKE. WE'LL MIX THEM TOGETHER. AND YOU CAN EVEN DO
SUCH CRAZY THINGS-- SEE, BECAUSE YOU
PAINTED ALL THIS IN BLUE-- IT SORT OF LOOKS
LIKE WATER TO ME-- SO MAYBE IN OUR WORLD--
PHEW--YOU BRAVE? MAYBE RIGHT ALONG THERE,
RIGHT ALONG THERE, WE'LL PUT JUST
A HAPPY LITTLE TREE. PSSHEW. LET'S GIVE HIM A LITTLE FRIEND. MAYBE HIS LITTLE FRIEND
LIVES RIGHT HERE. PSSHEW. THERE. WE'LL JUST HAVE A COUPLE
OF THEM LITTLE RASCALS. ALL RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE A BIG "V" THERE
FOR VICTORY. I'M GONNA TAKE PAINT THINNER,
A LOT OF PAINT THINNER, AND GO INTO THE BLACK
WITH THE SAME OLD BRUSH. BUT I WANT THIS PAINT
TO BE VERY THIN. VERY, VERY THIN. AND LET'S COME UP HERE,
AND MAYBE WE'LL MAKE US WHAT LOOKS LIKE
AN OLD PALM TREE. THIS IS VERY THIN PAINT. YOU TOUCH, GO AROUND LIKE THAT,
THEN YOU CAN GRAB IT AND JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE PULL. SEE? IT'LL MAKE
ALL THOSE LITTLE DOERS. ALL RIGHT. OK. LET'S PUT IN SEVERAL HERE,
WHEREVER WE THINK THEY MIGHT BE. UP IN HERE THERE'S SOME. THERE'S ANOTHER ONE,
THERE'S ONE. HOWEVER. AND YOU CAN JUST GRAB THEM
AND GIVE THEM A LITTLE PULL. BUT THE PAINT HAS TO BE
VERY THIN, ESPECIALLY ON THIS DRY CANVAS. IF IT'S NOT REALLY THIN,
IT WILL NOT DO THIS. AND YOU HAVE TO ALSO BE
A LITTLE CAREFUL BECAUSE IF IT'S TOO THIN, IT'LL RUN
AND RUIN YOUR WHOLE DAY. DRIP RIGHT OFF THE CANVAS. THERE. THIS IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST WAYS
OF MAKING A LITTLE PALM TREE. THERE WE ARE. OK. TELL YOU WHAT, THIS
OTHER ONE OVER HERE IS BALD. WE'LL PUT SOME--
PUT SOME HAIR ON HIM, TOO. THAT REMINDS ME, I HAD A LETTER
FROM A LADY HERE A WHILE BACK. SHE TOLD ME IF I WAS
GONNA WEAR A WIG, I COULD AT LEAST GET ONE
THAT MATCHED MY BEARD. AND I SENT HER AN ANSWER BACK
AND TOLD HER IF I'D PAID FOR THIS WIG, I'D--I'D TAKEN IT
BACK TO THE STORE NOW AND ASKED FOR A REFUND
BECAUSE ALL THE HAIR IS FALLING OUT OF IT, HMM. THAT'S FOR SURE. OLD AGE IS CATCHING UP WITH ME. THERE WE ARE. OK. MAYBE ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE. BUT YOU COULD PUT
A WHOLE PALM FOREST OUT HERE IF YOU WANTED TO,
JUST WHATEVER. LET'S TAKE--LET'S TAKE A KNIFE,
A LITTLE BIT OF-- WE'LL JUST USE A LITTLE GRAY
AND WHITE, SINCE THAT'S HANDY. I JUST WANT TO PUT
THE INDICATION HERE OF A LITTLE HIGHLIGHT ON THIS,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. DON'T WANT TO OVERDO IT. DON'T WANT TO OVERDO IT. OK. FIRM UP THIS SIDE A LITTLE. BUT ISN'T THAT NEAT? NOW, WE CAN COME
RIGHT BACK IN HERE. LET'S TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF THE DARK SIENNA. WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THIS THING
SOMETHING TO SIT ON. WE'LL GIVE IT A LITTLE LAND
RIGHT THERE, SOMETHING LIKE SO. TAKE A LITTLE WHITE,
A LITTLE DARK SIENNA, MIX THEM TOGETHER
SO IT LOOKS SORT OF LIKE LITTLE BEACH SAND THERE. PSSHEW. AND WE'LL JUST LET THAT FADE
RIGHT ON OFF INTO NOTHING. AND WE'LL TAKE
OUR LITTLE FAN BRUSH THAT HAS THE GREEN ON IT,
AND WE'LL POP IN A HAPPY LITTLE BUSH OR TWO
RIGHT AROUND HIS LITTLE FOOTS. DON'T WANT HIM LEFT OUT. LOOKS LIKE HE'S JUST SORT OF
SITTING OUT HERE IN THE WATER, ALL BY HIS SELF. TAKE OUR LINER BRUSH, A LITTLE BIT OF THAT
DARK GREEN COLOR, AND LET'S JUST POP IN
A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE SO, OR WHEREVER. MAYBE THE WIND'S BLOWING SORT OF
A LITTLE BIT IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT JUST LIFT THOSE... LIKE THAT. THERE. AS I SAY, THIS IS THE LAST SHOW
OF THE 21st SERIES, AND IT'S ALWAYS SAD FOR ME
TO HAVE TO FINISH A SHOW. BUT WE'LL BE BACK. WE'RE ALREADY UNDER PRODUCTION
FOR THE NEXT SERIES. WE'VE ALREADY GOT SOME IDEAS
STARTED, AND ANNETTE AND I ARE GETTING READY TO DO THAT,
SO--SO WE'LL BE BACK. AS LONG AS YOU'LL WATCH US,
WE'LL KEEP--WE'LL KEEP ON MAKING SHOWS. NOW WE CAN TAKE
A LITTLE TOUCH MORE OF THIS. JUST BRING THE BOTTOM OF IT
TOGETHER LIKE THAT. HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THIS ONE. THIS IS SO DIFFERENT THAN
ANYTHING WE'VE DONE BEFORE, BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY
GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS ON HOW YOU CAN DO SOME
FANTASTIC SCENES YOURSELF. GIVE IT A TRY, AND I'D LOVE
TO SEE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU TRY THIS,
YOU'LL ABSOLUTELY FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. I GOT JUST A MINUTE HERE LEFT. I'M GONNA TAKE SOME
OF THAT DARK GREEN COLOR ON THE FAN BRUSH, AND I'M JUST
GONNA HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THESE LITTLE PALM FRONDS
UP HERE JUST WITH A LITTLE GREEN, JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM
STAND OUT A LITTLE. THERE. AND I THINK WITH THAT, WE'RE
GONNA CALL THIS OLD PAINTING FINISHED, AND WE'RE GONNA BRING
THIS SERIES TO AN END. FROM ALL OF US
HERE AT THIS STATION, WE'D LIKE TO WISH YOU
HAPPY PAINTING, GOD BLESS, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU
IN THE NEXT SERIES.
