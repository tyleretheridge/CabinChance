hey welcome back I'm glad you joined me today and I hope you get your paints all set up and you're ready to do a fantastic little painting with me tell you what let's start out today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let's go on up here I've got my standard Oh canvas up here it's all covered with liquid white and it's slick and it's ready to go so let's get started today let's do a little autumn scene has a lot of nice colors and it's a lot of the reds and oranges and yellows and it's such a fantastic day let's just do a fantastic little painting and we'll start out today with a little bit of phthalo blue small amount just tap little into the 2 inch brush and let's go right up here we'll just use our little crisscross strokes just like so and let's just dance in a happy little sky just sort of let it wander around have fun play there now your color is continually mixing with a liquid white and that way it's very smooth you get all these different values you don't end up with just one dead color up here there just let it go have fun with it enjoy it painting should make you happy there but see all this beautiful blending that you get if you run a drag canvas you'd be in agony city now now you can blend this till it's just as smooth as it can be I want to leave some of these little spots in it and that'll look how it looks almost like distant clouds without doing a thing there we go so when you're doing your painting make make a big decision do you want to blend these all out do you want to leave some of them in it's totally completely up to you there we are see and that easy we have a happy little sky tell you what we'll just take a same old dirty brush I'm lazy today I don't want to clean it I'm going to write into some Van Dyke Brown and Dyke Brown with a pickup some dark Sienna I'm going to use mostly Browns today for the base colors just tap a little color into the brush and let's let's start making some big decisions here use just the corner of the brush let's start tapping in some basic dream bush shapes here there and I usually start at the bottom and work up that way my darkest color is down here and it gets lighter toward the top and it it gives the indication that there's deep shadows down here there we go and all the little creatures need a place to hide so they hide down here in this at all we're looking for here is just some very basic little shapes just sort of let your imagination go if you want the shadows to be a little darker a little deeper add a little tiny amount of the midnight black that'll really create some darkness down here there we go there's another happy little Bush see how you can adjust you can create tree after tree Bush after Bush okay just anything that you want anything that you want maybe there's one yep you're right he lives right there right there he's got some arms at hang we there and it fantastic that easy you can make all kinds of little things there maybe there's another tree there another one hidden between them we don't know we don't know we'll separate them with highlights right now all we're doing is just blocking in some color so we're doing okay maybe maybe we appears a nice one okay as I say if we're going to have a little fall scene we need a lot of a lot of Browns in here so I just load a lot of color into the brush it doesn't matter how you load it and let's just let's just fill this in let's just fill this out all I'm using is the two Browns a little bit of black all I'm looking for here is just a nice dark brownish color and this will be our base color home we put all the beautiful little highlights there we go little bit more over here and there's really not a lot of paint on the canvas just enough to cover it sneaking already we have the whole thing filled in and we can wash your brush wash your brush if we wash our brush as you know with over two Stanner shake off excess it just beat the devil out of it okay tell you what let's take our liner brush I'm going to dip it right into some paint thinner and go into the brown color this is the two Browns dark sienna Van Dyke Brown I want this to be thin like ink turn the brush that brings it to a nice sharp point turn it so use a long long bristles on this brush okay now then let's go up in here and we'll just begin putting in all kinds of little tree trunks and stems and twigs they're just wherever you want to let's say we're gonna come back and put leaves on all these trees here so a lot of these are going to be covered up but even if they're covered up if you get some practice your times not wasted any time that you learn you haven't wasted your time and painting is like everything else the more you practice the easier it becomes and the better you get the more confidence you have and half a painting is just being confident just believe in yourself believe that you can do it because you can you really can you can do anything there we go let's put see some people like to start at the top and come down to some start at the bottom and go up just however try it both ways whichever way works the best for you is the right way there now when you're doing this if you don't if your paint doesn't flow if you have troubles making it flow then all you have to do is add a little bit more thinner a little bit more thinner because of the paint's thin enough it will flow on here there and remember trees grow every which alway there we are let's have one appearing this old big ranch making big strong there seeing this is where if you sort of have a little nervous twitch to your hand you're ahead of everybody else because it gives these tree limbs and some character makes them interesting they're just not old straight and sticks there we are wherever okay now then tell you what let's do let me get her let me grab a one-inch brush here we'll go into a small amount of the darks and I first just to get a little color on the brush it I'm gonna go right down here to the yellow CAD yellow and the only reason I put that dark sand on there first is to dull this yell I don't want it too bright this is CAD yellow yellow ochre Indian yellow a little touch of the bright red and we're going to use all these colors let me grab a little too red over here who is pretty this is going to be a fall scene we need a lot of that now then let's just start picking out some highlights take just the corner the brush and just begin creating all kinds of just beautiful to the leaf patterns here just the corner the breasts all you need to worry about form and shape don't just throw them in at random there we go and when you're doing fall pictures you can have two or three different colors on the same tree there sometimes you'll see trees it just certain parts of it are bright red or yellow or gold all paintings are so pretty and they go well with most things that people have in their homes a lot of times if you're out selling paintings you'll find it people buy paintings as much for color as for content there we are they're looking for something maybe that matches something in their living room or bedroom or wherever they're going to hang that painting so a lot of times color is more important than content I know it sounds crazy look up a little bit Indian yellow you're in there - that's a nice transparent yellow color just really designs through that there see all those little things once again think about form and shape and there's limbs inside of there don't just hit it random do one bush at a time one tree at a time make friends with him give him a name if necessary that's right as we mentioned before you know when you're a painter and people expect you to be a little different so you can get away with things like yet there we are I get so many fantastic letters from people all over the country and they send me ideas this idea came from I'm a card someone had sent me if there's things that you want to see that I'm not doing drop me a line let me know what it is that you want to see I'd love to hear from you and if you're painting if you're painting send me a photograph of your of what you're painting I'd love to see that it's unbelievable what some people are doing absolutely unbelievable there we go just all kinds of little things happening here maybe we'll take a little bit of yellow and add in there just the cad yellow make it Sun again sing in the sunshine out here there we are a little bit up here Jack Frost has had a good day here he has been through here he hasn't really worked on these trees worked over time here there we go but all this you can do with just the corner of the one inch brush or the two inch brush either one works very well there we go let's put the indication maybe hearing there the little bushes growing down here two foot of these trees back there maybe he's got a friend over here there we are here's another one just sorta in your mind figure out where you want these to be and drop them in wherever there's what I see one right there as you're painting along you'll you'll just visualize these you just sort of see up maybe here and there don't take a little bit of the titanium white and thin it down with some paint thinner maybe here and there we can see one and two sticks that are at a light in color they stand out great against this background light against dark dark against light always playing games with these so a few little light sticks here and there lolly there make it interesting there we are okay now if you want to add just a little bit more detail you could take just the point of the knife and just drop in all kinds of little sticks and twigs that are growing in here and all these little things show different planes in your pain they help create that illusion of depth and distance just wherever you want okay now then we have to make some big decisions here you know Fargo if I want to show you something I get letters from people also they say hey you know Bob I can't paint you can paint I want to show you what a friend of Mines daughter did this is this is my little girlfriend her name's Elise she's six years old and look at this painting that she did now if the lease can do this at six you don't have any excuse at all and she's the daughter of Dana jester he's one of our teachers that travels all over the country and that gives her a little advantage because she watches daddy paint all the time but you can do it six years old I'm proud of her we'll take a big brush here let's begin making some little some little grassy areas we'll just use our same colors here tap a little bit of paint right into the bristles now we have to make some big decisions where does our land live maybe right down here there we go now when you do this try to leave a little bit of this dark between them that dark is your separator that keeps them apart I like doing these kind of pictures because you can go crazy with color just use all kinds of beautiful colors there maybe there's some over on this side it comes right down through there wherever you want you have to make some big decisions I'm going to add a touch of alizarin crimson to my color crimson it's a nice fall color there we are now here and there here and there there's little patches still have some greens I've added a small amount of SAP green maybe Jack Frost messed up them there's always little patches it seemed to get away now the more you tap this the softer it will become it it'll look just like a little field out here or a meadow it's deep in fall colors or you can leave it a little stronger so it looks more like bigger bushes and trees this is sort of a decision that you'll have to make look at your painting decide what you want in it should let's go down the side here and again bringing some things down like so I tell you one I'm gonna tell you and this would be a good place to have maybe a little building back here so let's do that let's come right up in here and take the knife and scrape out a basic shape that does two things it allows you to lay there the proportions of your building out without being committed and it removes excess paint so just scrape out a very basic shape that's all we're looking long don't worry like so then I'll take some Van Dyke Brown a little bit of dark sin and let's go right up here and begin blocking that in all we're doing is just filling in color here we're just putting in some dark background color we could really care less we're not committed yet we can still change your mind we can do anything that we want to do here see ya need some sides on this maybe this would be an old barn whatever you want it to be whatever you want it to be just make a decision put it in over here soon can make those little noises or it doesn't work let's have a red roof on there we'll take some bright red a little touch of dark Sienna so it's not real bright it can get so bright it hurts your eyes cut off a little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife there it is now just take in touch just sort let it bounce right down top of that old building see there just let it bounce after you want to billing to be newer you can just pull it I want this one to be sort of rough and ragged it's had a hard life maybe on the other side you can see the least little touch of red over there now then let's take use some yellow ochre dark Sienna grab some titanium white pull it out very flat once again we cut across it and get our little roll of paint now then let's come right down here touch no pressure at all no pressure just let the knife glide on there just let it glide it'll slide right down there and it makes it makes the impression of very old wood a little dark right there on the shadow up underneath these eaves there we go that easy where we stood was that easy to really build a house let's put a put a door there if this is going to be a barn we need a big door and the color that I used on the front I'm going to use the same color only I've added some Van Dyke Brown to darken it because I won't decide to be much darker there if it doesn't stand out enough take a little bit of light color just come right back in there where they come together see and you can that way it'll separate it - a mean-looking old building a little bit of brown on the knife you can go in here put the indication a few boards Doupe Doupe Doupe Doupe now we come back they have a straight an old door out we can come back and do a barn ectomy we're just going to wacky them off from the bottom here and get him like we want him I don't take a little bit of titanium height on the knife and just sort of outline this door a little bit so it stands out good there we go now then go back to our big brush that we were using put the little grassy areas in will grab somewhere that alizarin crimson that's a nice color for fall just tap a little bit in there we come right along here and put a little bit right around his little foots and I have a little brass right around the edges here but there there's a little bit right in there and then we can just begin putting in all kinds of little things all I'm doing is gently tapping downward gently gently tap down it's absolutely no secret to this there we go I like all these oranges yellows and goals they're happy colors warm colors warm colors they make you feel good they're a little bit more red like just layer after layer start in the back and work forward always working forward forward forward a little bit more of the crimson mixed in there there we go and then I tell you I'll tell you when we need a little path or Road or whatever we want to call it coming from our little barn so I'll just take a fan brush and we'll go right into Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna mixed together just load it full of color and the old farmer had to have way to get up here so maybe it comes out here describe it just think about think about how you want this path to go just sort of scrub it in look at they're saying it leads right on back up in there and we'll take another fan brush put some of the yellows and alizarin crimson a little bright red just mix them on the brush here same colors nothing with that we can pop a few little grassy areas around the path that'll help push that path right down into the painting it makes it become part of it there we are see that easy so kinds little things that are growing around the edge here right there's nice one okay shoot let's get crazy do you know me you painted with me before you know I like big trees let's have a couple of big trees I like them there lives a tree right there this is just straight Van Dyke Brown there is there is soon I don't want it to be lonely we'll give him a friend that lives there with him there we are we can maybe this one's got a big ol rooted goes right out there and holds him up shoot let's get crazy let's have one on the other side too this one's really gonna be big mm but a wiggle in him huh well he's got hurt in him I don't like all my trees being straight so really get in there and bend them that gives them character makes them more interesting okay davon take the knife we'll just use some brown and white pulls out very flat cut across and we have our little roll of pain again and let's just come right in here just touch it give it a little little pull tiny little pull I just make the indication of some highlights on these trees just like so that really makes him stand out there okay a little bit on this big one on the other side don't want him left out he'd get angry Sainath Norris not angry tree I had lunch a smell across the yard one time there okay trees are a lot of fun a lot of fun we were working on our newsletter the other day and I did an article just about trees and people's problems with them excuse me a little more time to work in detail on up on our right rather than talking there that's a big old tree they're going to take the liner brush go right into paint thinner Van Dyck Brown thin it down like water let's go right up here panelist let's say in our world there's a big lamb lives on this tree comes right on out wherever there he comes just giving all kinds of character another one there wherever you want to wherever just sort of look at your tree and make a big decision where you think they live there but a few on this tree here we don't want him left town there we go there's one who comes right across they're just all kinds of little things that are going on maybe here's one you're right wherever you want this one comes right across all them there's another one just here and there spend some time with a tree look at it talk to it make friends with it they'll give you an idea of how lot of these things sound sorry look I get that go in here put a little stick right there where's the heck now then maybe there's a few leaves left on these trees and not many just a few I won't go into CAD yellow quite a bit of it let's go right up here I just want to put the indication of a few leaves that are still hanging on maybe most of these maybe the wind came by has blown most of them away but there's a few here so we'll just take almost straight CAD yellow put a few happy little leaves that are hanging in there literally hmm there we go King quite a few over here and I think we've got got a finished painting shoot there we are couple there I think we'll call this unrig unfinished hope you've enjoyed it from all of us here happy painting and God bless Oh Oh you
