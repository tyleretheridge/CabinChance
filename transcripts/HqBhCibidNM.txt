welcome back got your paints ready diesel set up and already do a fantastic painting with me good tell you what let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and while they're doing that let's go on up here let me tell you what I've already done I've covered this canvas which is an 18 by 24 as usual I've covered it with a piece of contact paper that has an oval cutting now this is just normal old contact paper you can pick up at your local hardware store grocery store whatever I've just cut an oval out of it stuck it on there and then I've covered this whole inside with liquid white as we normally do other than that there's nothing different about that I thought today we'd do a fantastic little winter scene that I really think you're going to enjoy so I tell you what let's go on up here and get started and we'll take right off and we'll start out today with a small amount of Prussian blue just a little bit and a little touch of midnight black so we have Prussian blue and midnight black okay and just mix them right on the brush like so okay let's go right up here now using the little crisscross or X strokes let's just make a happy little sky let's see how you're making these little X's just like so start at the top and work down word by starting at the top and working down word your paint and mix with the liquid white and automatically if your sky will get lighter toward the horizon and this is one of those little tricks that helps create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting still using a little crisscross strokes just like so this is just Prussian blue it midnight life okay yeah then well I have that color still on the brush we will have a little water in this I love water so I use the same colors just blue in black or black and blue whatever you prefer okay let's go right in here and I just go right across like so I don't know exactly where the water is going to be so anything it's not water what make it snow and I clear the winter singing all of this can be shadows really doesn't matter where you put this just just have fun okay now then let's wash your brush and we wash our brush with good old odorless dinner and be sure it's odorless if it's not son-of-a-gun you're gonna get run right out of the house you'll be working out in the yard shake off the excess then just take out all your hostilities this is really where you have fun now then with a good clean dry brush and we'll start in the light area and blend upward still using a little crisscross strokes of leg Stokes just blend upward like soft neck soft okay now very lightly we just go across and take out all those brush strokes so it is pretty smooth and because any areas that are real dark just blend them and they'll blend right in liquid white underneath is fantastic and we'll take out all those dark areas now I like to put a little black in this guy since this winter I want I want to give the impression that it's cold let's go across this just smooth out okay that quick we have a happy little sky now today let's make some clouds up here and for that we'll use the one-inch brush you can make these clouds with a one-inch brush two inch brush fan brush shoot you can make them with your shoe no big deal just take and pull this brush through the paint get a lot of paint on the brush tanks go right up here now you have to make a big decision where does your cloud live I think I think yep he lives right here and make it tiny little circles tiny little circles continually just like so see just happy little circles clouds boy they just float around have a good time and let your brush do that there he is maybe okay let's have another one down here wherever you think a cloud lives that's exactly where that son of a gun lives just drop it in there okay now I'm going to take a clean dry two inch brush and use just the top of the brush and very gently blend the bottom of the cloud out just blend the bottom of it out we're not touching the top at all yet now then we grab it and fluff it just fluff it up and do this in circular strokes avoid doing it straight up or it looked like it's raining up with a la dia then I really bother ya same thing down here just blend it out fluff it it it and go across now sometimes when you're painting clouds it's fun to do layers of clouds one on top of the other so completely finish one and then come back and watch here see we can go right in here and drop in another happy little cloud it may be he lives right underneath here it doesn't matter wherever you can put as many or as few clouds in your world as you want take our brush and give it a good little rep and do the same thing just blend it out a little bit see there and then pull it now this is two hairs and some air in other words it's extremely gentle the paint that we use is very firm so you can do all this blending without becoming a mud mixer if you use a very soft slammy paint you're in trouble the only time we use soft paints is for highlights and normally that's yellow yellow is normally always a highlight color so that can be very soft but these base colors you need to be strong very very strong tell you what let's do let's put some little trees back here in the background I'll mix up some black some blue while I get black and blue and a little bit of Van Dyke Brown okay let me clean off my knife and we'll take the round brush and we're going to tap just tap that right in there like so just like this now then I want some background trees back in here so all we're looking for right now is basic shapes start at the bottom of the tree and work upward so the bottom is darker than the top and put into some very basic shapes I think I'll put a whole line across here we'll just have trees all the way across you know in the last series I showed a little bird a little a little Robin that I was raising them that had lived with me since he was just a baby and we've had so many people write and tell us that they watch this and they want to know what happened to him let me show you the Robin this little bird was orphaned and he lives with me now and I feed him every day and take care of him and pretty soon he's going to be a big bird he's going to learn to fly and we're going to turn him loose and send him back to nature now just recently myself and Diane Schaefer she's the bird lady here in Muncie we release that Robin when he was full-grown I had raised him from a little tiny baby until he was a big bird and Diane and I let him go close to her house and that's really it there he went that really makes it all worthwhile my gosh I must have I must have spent half my life for a while there running around chasing earthworms to to feed this little Robin but I just wanted you to see that he was all right he grew up and I was so proud to let him go this year I raised seven little birds and they all went we had everything from Robins to starlings even I even raised some starlings and I know they may not be the best bird nor but I like I like all little birds there we go the lady you saw there on the screen that was with me as I say she's the bird lady here in Muncie and we're trying to put together a show d that will show what she does and how she takes care of all these birds and maybe you'll get to see that in the future okay I've put little trees all back here in the background I just want to create a little mist at the base so I'm just going to tap give it a little rub tap and go like so then give it a little upward lift see there it makes it a nicety misty and soft now then let me wash that round brush wash it the same way there's a screen in the bottom of this bucket that I scrub the brush against shake it off mmm and it's almost as much fun as a big brush now that let's have some snow on top of all these so I'm going right into the titanium white and I want tap tap firmly use the top of these bristles is where you really want to do the tapping go right up in here and get some paint on okay all right let's go right up in here now use just the top bristles and begin laying all kinds of little snow-covered areas on these trees see there you can just put thousands and thousands of leaves just with a couple of strokes but layer these see like once again creates distance I know you get tired of hearing me say about in distance but I think it's so important that paintings have distance out so many paintings are are flat and then you don't like them and I want you to be happy with what you learn and what you do we get letters from people all over the country saying it's working for them that they're turning out some of the most beautiful paintings you've ever seen and they never dreamed they could even paint and they can and you can you really can't do this we show you everything that you need here to do fantastic paintings absolutely fantastic paintings and we have teachers at travel all over the country like my son Steve why that little something you've seen him maybe on some of the other shows little bitty fella he's over six four he travels around and teaches people he's a lot of fun and there's about a dozen other teachers so if you ever get a chance go watch him they give demonstrations all over the country and you'll enjoy him okay now we have them some little snow-covered trees back here we can take our knife just go in here and scrape in indication of some little trunks and limbs and sticks twigs all kinds of things you got to have all these trees because my Robin has to have place to hide it up here there we go I hope you enjoyed seeing that little rascal as much as as much as I enjoy bringing him to you I am I'm so proud of him just like another kid okay now I'm going to take titanium white on the two-inch brush just pull it through the paint a lot of paint on the brush let's go right up here and then we have to make some big decisions where is the snow well I think it's river right there all right I see there that easy that easy you just make a decision decide where your snow lives and pull it in just drop it there we go and you can put all different angles in here so that it's not just monotonous not just one flat angle but now if you want it flat this is your world so you make it any way you want it there we go in that super that easy so two inch brushes what is the sign of again you can really get in there and build some snow in a second tell you what let's do let's have some fun today maybe we'll put a little barn out here and maybe one of the easiest ways that I've found to do barns and buildings of any kind is take your knife and scrape out a basic shape where you want him to live this removes excess paint and allows you to lay it out without really being committed maybe we'll do a weird-shaped one today what the heck you can do any shape barn and your painting that you want okay now come over here do something like that and down here down here whatever but see how easy it is to lay that whole thing out and you're not committed now we can go in here and start with some point let's go in here watch here well let me do it this way this is it best way so you stay in the lines so you just sort of outline it just sort of out bite it that'll help you keep it nice and smooth on the edges then pull down see how straight that line is hidden and sneaky I'll look for those easy ways to do things roof comes right down like that right on down and over here I need a little bit of snow there yes well I wished I could build a barn out quick now but Van Dyke Brown and we'll get right in here put a little Eve or an overhang then use some Bend a ground dark sienna sort of mixed together and we'll start off by just putting some dark in here we need dark in order for a light to show have to have dark for the light to show you put light against light you have nothing darker gets dark you have nothing painting is just continually dark against light ID and start can you clean off the old myth and then let's put some color in there I'll take some dark sienna some bright red mix it together let's put the least little touch of white in there oh that's nice don't over mix it leave it about like so cut off a little roll of paint see how even there it's all mixed and marbled okay let's go ahead up here now go just take the edge of the knife and just let it sort of bounce across if you get some down to snow like I have it don't worry you just take it right off we just sit that off don't worry about it see a little bit right in there now we take a cart knife hey and do a cabin ectomy it easy and save gives the impression of a lot of little boards that easy now a darker color and we come right in here there we go that's a little darker not as I've the lights going to hit in there now show you a little trick let's give us some brown on the knife here and come right down here to look see we have that little roll of paint on the knife that's so important that you have that little roll of paint now maybe maybe there's a little opening under here so just put dark right here there just a little bit of dark now over in here see we'll put some more boards like that and with our dark will continue that opening in that neat looks like there's a place under there the chickens could go at night as a kid I had all kinds of little chickens we put a poster said don't fall down the only problem that I wasn't a very good chicken farmer they turned out to be my friends and I wouldn't kill him shoot I we ended up with a bunch of chickens and we're hungry but I had my buddies okay I'm going to take a little brown this is Van Dyke Brown a little of the bright red in it and I got the little knife now I've cut off that little roll of paint with a little knife and over here I just want to show when we just go in a different angle see that his boards going that way and when you're doing these old buildings I don't know if you see that maybe if I make a little bit lighter you see a little better there see when you're doing these you designed your barn however you want it barns grow all kinds of ways however the old farmer wanted to make them all right now then let's put some snow around the edges here to do that I'm going to dip the fan brush right into liquid clear and then go into the titanium white I dipped it into the liquid clear to make this paint a little thinner it's much thinner than what's on the canvas all right now that we could come right up here grab this and pull it because it's thinner it'll lay on there and you can get away with doing all kinds of things just look at that look at that Snow's lived right up in here now if you were trying to put a paint on there that was the same thickness you'd run into some problems that you would yell at me and I want you to be happy I want this to work for you there we go yeah then let tell you what let's do let's start bringing some little things while I have that clear maybe there's a little pond right here I had to make some big decisions that's gonna live right in there right in there I'm going to take we use two inch brush a little bit of the black and blue on a dark and underneath here a little bit so it looks like a happy little reflection or two and then just fill across just blend that in want it a little bit darker and that easy there we go now with our liquid clear and titanium white we can begin bringing all these little things in here little pond lives right out here see okay there's another one just however many you want this is your little pond so you put them where you want a little dark underneath go across creates that illusion of a reflection maybe oh there we go we'll just do it that way see how easy it is to make snow snow can be one of the most fun things you do same will brush I'm going to add a touch of the black and blue maybe right in here there's a little bush he lives right in there like that and then we can pull it out this same idea works very well for making little sand dunes - if you ever doing little beach scenes likes it very nice okay liquid white put it out on the pallet or just cut across it and we'll just put some some happy little water lines around here sort of clean all this up bring it together and it easy can anyone over here wherever you want now you could even take your fan brush and pull a little bit of white across there and make it look like it's froze and cold everybody get your coat out now get your coat down now then I'm going to find the liner brush a little bit of brown maybe maybe right in here there's a happy little little stick lives here they're bidding I had to make those little noises or don't work a few little sticks and twigs here and there maybe there's a couple around the house this fella probably cuts his yard about like I do and I'm the world's worst yard keeper tell you what let me get a fan brush here and I have several these old fan brushes going go right into some Van Dyck Brown load the brush full of paint a lot of color a lot of color okay let's go right up I know what I want to do let's take the oval often and I'll show you what happens bring the camera right up here close and I'm going to take this piece of contact paper off look here little in that fantastic right there you got a beautiful painting but you know me I can't stop with it I got to keep it lit with it I get letters all the time said Bob you had a beautiful painting I thought you had ruined it too right to the very end now on a tree I like to break the borders on these ovals we introduced these ovals all three or four series ago and they have become one of the most popular things we've ever done I get letters from all over the country and and pictures but people have showed me what they have done with ovals and numerous other shapes not just oval so numerous other shapes on the brown take a little bit titanium white just touch give it a little pull little pull and when you're doing this at home try all kind of shapes placemats are a good place to get some nice ideas for different kind of shapes you'll have a lot of fun with them okay now back to my liner brush and a very thin paint just pick up paint thinner on its like water and let's go right up in here and put a little tree limb here or something see and if this paints very thin then it will literally flow and just put however many limbs you want wherever you want them let some of them come across the trunk that don't just put them all coming straight out you look like somebody took a big razor blade and sliced your tree in two and half the lot on the floor say some of these limbs come across the tree now you could put all kinds of little tiny ones here I don't have I don't have time to put all of them in because if I go over 30 minutes or that director yells and screams at me but that's how you do them right there okay let's take our one inch brush just plain old one inch brush and I want to put some greenery down or some shrubbery down here go right into the blue in the black because we need the dark in order to show light and just go right in here and just pop in all kinds of little tree and bush shapes all we're doing right now is putting in some dart so our light off show that's really all we're doing this is just dark so our light will stand out just shine now take another one-inch brush dip it into the liquid white and pull it through titanium white number I have the least little touch of the bright red just give it a little pinkish flavor I live in one direction so that it generates a curve turn that curve toward the top go ahead up here touch and begin forming individual little bushes one at a time don't get in a hurry do one Bush at a time remember each Bush has its own personality each one's own each one's the individual they're like people just however many of you want however many and work in layers just like with the little trees in the background tell you what maybe there's a little bit of snow paint on the ground right there let that snow break that oval see there pretty and you can do it you really can do it and more of the liquid white titanium white little touch the bright red and then a little bush you too that comes down right onto the path just like so and huge let's get let's have some fun here let's go right here and maybe there's a happy little fence stuck down here see just take the knife a little Brown drop him in decide how many poster on your fence nextstep put a little touch of snow on the top each one come across a little paint make some wire that makes a very interesting little painting I think we just about have a a completed painting hope you enjoyed these ovals try one yourself and know that you'll have a lot of fun until next time happy painting god bless I look forward to seeing you again you Oh you
