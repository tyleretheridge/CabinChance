hi welcome back certainly glad you can join me today you ready to do a fantastic painting thought today would do something that's a little bit different and I really really believe you're going to enjoy this let's go up here let me talk just a second now we have our good ol 18 by 24 inch canvases normal but today I've covered the entire canvas with a very very thin coat of the liquid clear and if you remember in some of the past series I've used that to do some beautiful beautiful seascape and I've got so many letters saying can I do landscapes with it well I want to show you something that's a little different and I think you're going to enjoy it so let's start out and having run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this little painting with me and they'll come across as usual starting with the white and they are in the same order that I have them on my palette and let's go on up here and get started as I say there's just a very thin coat of this liquid clear biggest thing to remember when you're using the clear is to put the tiniest little amount on it goes so far one jar will probably last you the rest of your life very very thin amount now then let's have some fun let's do something that's wholeness to a background a day that's a little different I will start with a least little touch of dark sienna and very little paint very little paint let's go right up here that this pick a spot you like and let's do something like it easy that is alright now reach over here we'll grab a touch of alizarin crimson same way but there's very very little paint on the brush very little and we'll just do this that most of these colors in the background that I'm going to use States or transparent but by being transparent they'll give you a whole different effect and if you had liquid white on the canvas you'll enjoy this one okay I'm going to go into a touch of Van Dyck Brown just least little touch Lee's little touch and we'll just do another one and all I'm doing is making little streaks of color here and there get a tiny little bit of the blue tiniest little bit of blue will come right up in here like this right there and just sort of let these colors work together but we don't want to blend them totally - yeah just sort of hearing their and just sort of let your imagination go crazy this is one of those paintings you should really do when you're when you're a fantastic happy mood and you just sort of want to let things happen I'm just going back and forth between the Crimson's and the Browns and whatever so to let your imagination be your guide here back to the dark sienna you gonna put a little darker streak here in there and there's why I want to make the indication this would be almost almost unrecognizable back in here maybe maybe there's just the slightest little indication of some distant trees I'm going back into the dark sienna and tapping just tap a little color maybe we'll pick up a little bit of the crimson a tiny little bit of color take let's go back up here and maybe back we back in here there's some big trees that live back in there but they're so far back you don't make out anything but just very very little shapes there we're not looking for any detail avoid detail at this point there we go add a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown in there and you can make some of them maybe a little darker this is almost abstract back here okay maybe there's a little bit in here wherever you just sort of make up your mind where you'd like one and drop it in because this is for today this is really your creation I don't even know what this was going to end up being there's one that's a little bit darker so alright now then tell you what I'm just beat the paint out of breath very lightly very lightly I'm just going to lift all this up just barely touching I want to blend it right back into that background see there yeah then I'm going to lay the pallet down today pick up a let me grab a fan brush here there we go here's a nice fan brush and we're going to dip it into the paint thinner now the liquid clear and paint thinner have almost a violent reaction so watch what happens I'm just going to use the edge of the knife and just flick a little on here look at that see makes all those beautiful little patterns in there now this is so much fun you can get carried away and just eat it all up so just a little at a time just little little time you could always add more and if you do two meetings you don't like them you can go back and add some color in there see how pretty that is and it's so simple and it makes an effect it's very unique and it looks like thousands and thousands and thousands of little leaves that are far far away but we have no detail in them yet there we go now longer this sets the more these little things will grow let's have some more fun let's do some big evergreens now we have this nice soft background I'll take some blue and some black I'll grab a bunch of brown some SAP green shoot we'll throw some crams in there too I'm just really looking for a dark color any Mazal mix up a big bunch okay let me clean my knife off here tell you what let's do today let's make some nice big evergreens back here and we'll use two inch brush sometimes we avoid this big brush because it's so big but it'll do absolutely fantastic things now pull the brush through the paint and wiggle it as you pull it both sides wiggle and then sharpen it just like you would a fine knife and you can bring this brush to a super chiseled edge so sharp it is like that that's what you're looking for pull it through by wiggling it a lot of pain in the bristles if you don't have a lot of paint then the bristles will not stick together and they'll flop open every time okay so it's just sharpen it so it's very sharp now there may be right in here there is now we'll have a big evergreen tree and just begin working back and forth use just the corner of the brush and push downward just push downward now these are close to you so we're going to have a lot of detail look at that do you ever believe you could make such a fantastic tree with a great big brush look at that I tell you what let's do I see something else here that I think would just work very nice in a painting you want to put a lot of planes these planes create the illusion of depth and distance let's put a plane back here before we put too much on and I'll show you how that up that will help push everything back I'm going to use the round brush and the tiniest little bit tiniest little bit of the dark Sienna and just tap okay let's go ahead up here maybe there's some little bushes it live right there Tiny's a little bit of color though there we go and that easy you can create all kinds of happy little bushes that live back here just like so now how about taking the brush and pulling it see this once again is a color it's very transparent so very nice little things happen and when we're done this will look like a little plane back here I'll show you in just a second and that'll help create the illusion of more distance in your painting of course none of us interested in that happy buck but should you be this is what sells your painting with a liner brush where the paint has been thinned a little thinner you can add just the indication of a few little sticks and twigs back here up to any just a few just to feel like so okay shoot on to make some more them evergreens those are fun back to our very dark color a very very dark color load that brush full of paint to a nice sharp chisel edge see sometimes maybe you just wanna make the indication of trees that are far away watch here you can just take that brush and tap downward give it a little pull and make the indication of trees that are far away that you don't see a tremendous amount of detail in and wherever you think they should live that's exactly where they're to live look at that see you can make hundreds of trees that are far away that simple see well we've been talking here this background has continued to grow the little dots and then pretty though and you can make all kinds of beautiful effects with a clear and then just break them a little thinner on it I'm not a very good portrait payer but I'm sure you you might be and it's a super background for doing portraits off try that sometime you'll enjoy it okay let's go back here I don't want this one big old tree to get lonely so I'm going to give him a friend and his friend his friend lives her right there see the corner the brush this will give you some practice with that big brush Oh it'sa the best tree maker you ever seen beautiful beautiful trees beautiful trees okay maybe there's another one that's right there wherever you want to wherever there we go just tree after tree after tree and between each tree reload the brush start with a brush it has a nice sharp edge on it and you'll get much better results let that work right on down wherever you want it to go tell you I'll tell you maybe there's another one right there see there there he is there he is and we'll put one little one here so you can make little trees with a large brace - look at that that easy and now then we can take the knife take a little bit of the dark sienna these little touch of white into its dark sienna and white pull it out cut off that little roll of paint let's go up here now that let's just put the indication here and there of a little tree trunk in some of these trees and you're not going to see the entire trunk so just here and there don't don't get over concerned about it there we are drop it in and you can scrape through just literally scrape right through the paint see you can probably hear that make all kind of little sticks and twigs in there this is your world so you make the determination where things live and you drop them in wherever you want okay good told you this would be a fun little painting and very different same old dirty brush going right into the cat hill now because we had all the blue in the black in there when that touches at yellow it's going to turn a beautiful beautiful dark green color reload the brush back to the same shape chisel edge it's very very sharp that you could almost shave it in okay now come back in here and then we're going to just gently highlight these just using the corner of the brush if you have trouble making the paint stick add the least little touch of paint thinner least little touch a little bit goes a long way because a thin paint will stick to a thick paint there we go there we go yeah then this big ol tree here ended your painting you put as many or as few highlights as you want just sort of look at it make it a termination and drop it in just drop it in but if you put too much you're going to kill the beautiful dark color and your painting will get flat so be careful be careful there we go all right I don't down wherever okay tell you what let me grab another brush I have I have several brushes going here now watch right in here I'm going to start gonna just scrub in a little bit of color right up to this dark now we're going to begin creating the lay of the land so just scrub it in the liquid clear is on the canvas and the big thing here is to use almost no paint just virtually no pain I'm just literally scrubbing it in maybe maybe the lay of the land will go this way over here we'll have this setting up on a little Hill life and you decide in your painting you decide how the lay of the land will go we're not trying to teach you to copy here we're trying to teach you a technique and then turn your loose on the world as you can do anything that you want to do and I heard one time that you can have anything that you want anything that you want if you help enough other people get what they want so you have to do think about that a little bit now then with the same brush I'm going to begin reaching up in here and I'm going to grab a little touch of this dark don't add any more color to you brush just grab this and begin working it outward if you need more come up in here and get it just happened downward and let it begin working outward and this is the way we'll make all different planes in this painting and that meat and now you can see how that push that area back here we go just let it go and you have to determine how far it goes okay and all I'm doing is just tapping down just tapping down over here I want to change the angle I want this to look like you're setting up on a little hill as we mentioned earlier so that's the way you make the lay of the land go and the more you tap this the softer it will become say let's go right up here we can create things happening in here look at that in head fantastic I really think you'll like this liquid clear it is a lot of fun and you can do this with any color any colors especially the transparent colors and we just sort of begin rounding this off by just tapping just by tapping and you could go in and you can pick up a little bit of brown if you want to and create different little things all kinds of happy little effects hmm a little bit of the Browns and maybe even a touch of crimson here and there however you sort of look at it and you make the determination what you wanted your painting I knew you could do it do anything we just sort of let that fade off into nothing Gus have some fun let's take the little knife and maybe maybe there's a fence here so a nice way to start here let's take the small edge of the small die and very firmly very firm see there isn't that neat and I'm using a lot of pressure you have to decide how far back your little little fence will go but just by taking the knife and pulling down very firmly you're really getting in there digging into the canvas tell you what how is so much fun let's do another one maybe right over here very firm can you hear how hard I'm pushing it okay now let's have some rails on this fence same thing I'm just gonna take the small edge of the knife and very firmly just go right up like that and perspective wise let it get now they get bigger out here okay let's do the same thing over here very firm I'm literally bending the knife and you can let them get wider as they get closer to you that'll help push everything back let's do that I'll make us make this one a wider oh there's a nice one rickety old fence had to fence these trees in so they wouldn't get away at it I'll take my liner brush and I'm going to some oh this is titanium white with a least little touch of brown in it let's go ahead up here and we can come right along and just sort of highlight these go right along the top see just enough to sort of bring it together a little highlight there across the top doop doop doop a little bit across that fence and off we go hidden that sneaky I thought you'd like this now then back to my big brush and I just want to tap the base of these little fences just to work them in like it look like you pick up a little dark see and go back in here make it look like there's a little grass that you're on right here to bottom with his foots there lift it over here and you can create some super super effects shooting at something that's that's just unreal it's very easy and it's a extremely enjoyable painting I will take a fan brush and go into some Oh a little bit of Van Dyck Brown some dark sienna I'm gonna reach down here and dip my brush right into some liquid clear so now I'm making this paint quite thin it's quite thin you can probably see it looks shiny there it's nice and thin okay let's come right out in here and now let's get crazy let's just go in here and just literally just punch him I'm just pushing very hard making the bristles bend upward see there we're just going to punch him a few little things here and there just drop them in that'll come right on out like that and then I'm going to begin grabbing them cause this paints thin you can do this just for the corner of the brush I begin just pulling off all kinds of little grassy things here and there I'm going to also add a touch of yellow ochre and begin lifting it up here and there just lift it up give it a pull lighter lighter lighter wherever you want these things to go it's really up to you it's really up to you see ya and don't have them all just straight you can pull them to leave her and they wiggle and they have fun this going to look like old grassy things growing here lighter lighter lighter as it works away because there's more shadow in there we want to keep that darker okay now we can go back pick up our large brush and once again we're going to grab this and begin tapping just tap and allow it to pick up a little bit that color and work out like this will smooth out the whole base of it see there also once again it helps create more planes in your painting this painting is so simple if this is your first attempt with liquid clear I think you will absolutely love it tell you what let's do something a little different I normally don't do this but I'm going to today we'll take a little bit of the liquid clear on the filbert brush and I'm gonna go right in to a titanium white I want this paint to be quite thin we get a little more than clear it's quite thin alright then let's go right up here maybe back in here there lives a few little little happy daisies see there are you going to do is just pop them in these little daisies are simple that's about the easiest little flower to make even I can make these and I'm not a big flower painter let's see just pop them in like so and you put as many in your painting as you want just pop them in hop on them there's one right here there I think we'll have little flowers all over here but you need to keep this paint very thin now the other thing that this clear is so fantastic about when this paint dries everywhere you put liquid clear it will be shiny it's almost like a glaze coat you'll have a nice glaze to it there is one maybe lives right here and I tell you I t reach over here and we'll get a little blue we'll have some we'll have some pretty little blue daisies - okay it's very thin very thin and there's one he lives yep right there right there he's got a friend over here this friend's name is Henrietta we have another one just as many or as few as you want so say you have to make these determinations and you put them wherever you think they should be because that's exactly exactly where that little rascal should live and just sort of look around and and see where you are there in that pretty little just a little field of daisies out here in front of all those trees maybe just one if he lives right out here just drop them in that I'm just sort of fall off the brush I think yep they'll have one right here look at that okay let me let me wipe off the brush get a little clean this is a number six filbert brush that I'm using to do this you could probably make these with your liner brush without any problem just as well I'm gonna go take the filbert brush let me get a little liquid clear go ride into a touch of yellow ochre just load a little bit in there and we'll go back and just touch give it a little bit into the some of these little daisies here give it a little sinner see there however high everything you want okay yeah let's take our liner brush I'm gonna get that using paint thinner go right into the brown in here and there we need to put the indication of a few little sticks and twigs and little grassy things grow up through here wherever and you you know you put in a few little stand to hold your flowers up daunting to fall over see little stick here in there didn't had fantastic try this I think you'll really enjoy it and from all of us here until next time happy painting god bless you
