hey welcome back certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do another fantastic painting with me drag out your paints and let's get started we've already got the canvas up here we've got it covered with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white and it's all wet and it's ready to go so let's have them graphically around all the colors across the screen but you need to do this painting with me and while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started tell you what let's make a pretty little sky today I'm going to start with a little touch of Prussian blue Russian blue black and the least little touch of yellow ochre black blue and a little touch of yellow ochre let's add a little white to that so we can see what we get maybe just a little bit more of a yellow ochre like that makes a beautiful little color don't go crazy with the yellow ochre or you'll end up with a bright green color okay wipe off the knife grab a 2 inch brush here and I'm just going to tap the 2 inch brush right into that color just tap it right in there like so okay let's go right up here let's just take him just sort of twist in a little sky here I'm just using a little circular strokes just sort of letting us bounce around and play wherever or just leave little places open but just very quickly just using little twirling motions to sort of drop in a happy little thing here and there maybe a little bit down here see how quick head goes wherever you want to just make a decision and drop it in there we are we just sort of mix it up just blend it all together and have fun with it while I have that color on the old brush let's have a little water in this painting so I'll go right back in the same quarter same color same color tongue got over my teeth and I couldn't see what I say it there we go now let's just pull this right across straight across like so and maybe like here I don't know exactly where we'll have water in this one but somewhere somewhere I love water I would put water and just about everything that I do let's wash the brush wash your old Russian odorless thinner shake it off and have a box down here that I shake the brush into it just beat the devil out of it now with a nice clean brush I'll go back up in here just very quickly just sort of wind this up and blend it together you still have light and dark areas in the sky and that's what I'm looking for I don't want to sky this just one flat old dead color now here all the way across very lightly all that together see now I just use the same old brush I'll go right into titanium white I'm going to really pull the brush through the paint just get a lot of paint on the brush let's go right up here and decide maybe there's some happy little clouds that live in this guy see I don't want a real distinct clouds I just want some indication so I'm just gonna just push a little color right in there maybe yeah maybe right here there's a nice cloud it just he floats around has fun all day to me clouds clouds could very well be the freest thing in nature and when you're painting them paint on that way just let them go let them have fun Adam have fun okay now then I'll wash the brush I just like to wash the brush cheek off and hiss I just covered the studio yet now they're just very lightly all I'm gonna do is just sort of blend these I don't want to I don't want to blend these all the way I just want to sort of blend them lift them here and there lightly lightly lightly don't want to lose all these little actions that we've created in that a fantastic way to make a super little sky in just a second okay today let's try let's try all round brush and I'm going to go right into the same color same color that we made this guy with just tap the brush tap it maybe I'll have a touch more of the black okay just tap all right let's go right up here I want to make some little background trees at a far far away so start right in here and just begin tapping in some very basic shapes all we're looking for is just general shapes I'm looking for detail all we want is just a very very basic shapes and you put as many or as few as you want yours sort of assorted top of it and with that same color I'm pushing downward now I want to drop some of that color right into the water look at there that'll end up being our our happy little reflections without cleaning the brush now when I had a touch of yellow ocher and just come right around and I just want to put a tiny little bit of highlight here in there don't overdo this is too far away little endian yellow too far away don't want much just to create the illusion of individual bushes here and there you could even add the least little touch of the bright red not much very little just just enough to sort of make them stand out this little round brush makes some of the most super delicate little leaves and you're just using the top of the brush just the top bristles over here maybe a few little happy things there there okay see you there but not easy now let's make some reflections here let's grab right here and pull straight down it's important that you pull straight down straight down look at that look at that instant instant reflections well I used to go crazy trying to do reflections when I was traditional painter I turned the canvas upside down just work myself to death and now you just give it a little downward pull off you go going back into that same old color and to that I want to add a little bit of Van Dyke Brown same color same color a little bit of Van Dyke Brown added to it and let's go right in here and just tap you just a happy little thing I guess these little things just create Plains different layers of depth in the painting and they just really make your painting exciting and people look at it they just won't believe the number different planes that you have in it there pull straight down once again see that creates a reflection goes lightly across and look at that now with a knife right into a touch of the liquid white just a touch pull it out very flat and cut across hold out let's do that again pull it out and cut across so there's just a little bit on the knife flap cross dance go right okay now that I want to put some water lines back in here this does two things it's a little light area between the darks and it cleans up the bottoms at the same time you can sort of bring everything together just like so and you can make them some big some little just rub them very firmly very firmly see how it's already creating different levels layers see maybe there's one right here because look at the distance you can create just for these little water lines they're sneaky a lot of fun to use there we go hey take just a clean pointing light and here and there just scrape in the indication of a little little trunk we'll stay put twig here they're just hair you wanna hey good go round brush is so much fun let's go back to it I'll take let's go into Van Dyck Brown reach over here let me pick up some black little touch a blue not much blue okay let's go right back up here now maybe we begin we can begin building things forward I wanna yeah right here oh just a happy little tree lives here but maybe this tree maybe this trees closer to us so he's bigger he's a bigger tree he's stronger he may be no bigger than these but he's closer to us alright that makes him look bigger okay and needless to say we'll want a reflection in the water let's just do that while we have the color on here and at this point you don't have to make any big decision on where got a hair there on where the reflection and the real thing meet we do that later right now all we're doing is adding in color alright put a touch of crimson into that crimson black little touch blue and just tap tap that brush firmly okay maybe on the other side here probably get this over us going let's drop in notice I start at the bottom and work up that way the tree or the bush whatever you're making here is darker at the bottom than it is on the top and that's the way it would be if you went out and look to the tree because more lights going to come through here down here there's all kind of undergrowth there's a lot of things that would stop the light creep the dark shadows real dark shadows and so you start here it is your brush runs out of paint you just go up up up and all we're looking for here it's just the basic shape we're not worried about detail at this point we'll worry about that in a minute some crimson knees in black I'm going to touch blue maybe right in here I'm gonna mess around cover this whole thing up but that's okay as long as you long as you have fun and you learn from it nothing is wasted anytime that you practice it's not wasted you're going to be good at anything you have to practice that's the price you have to pay there we go hey let me find my liner brush I'll use the old liner birthday go into some thinner and right into my Van Dyck Brown now I want to make this paint very thin a consistency of ink turn the brush that brings it to a nice sharp point turn it can't go up here let's have a happy tree trunk right in there like so and you can put as many or as few limbs as you want we're gonna put leaves on this so a lot of us gonna get covered up so you don't have to worry too much about it we'll go right on to the other side here you get a little more thinner gotta keep this paint very thin so it literally flows off your brush can add some dark see out of that but a more thinner little more thinner there we go paint is literally like water maybe maybe maybe maybe let's put wine it goes right up there and one of the questions that I'm asked over and over is do you start at the bottom and work up or the top and work down doesn't matter you do it whichever way works the best for you try both ways and for some people you'll find one way works good some people will find the other way so you can start out here on the small part and bring it in toward the trunk or you can start at the trunk and work out just however you do it the way it works the best for you there really no set rules you find what works for you and that's the way that's right that's the way that's right it makes you happy and it's good if it doesn't make you happy ooh bad move okay maybe there and you can put as many or as few little diesel limbs and branches out here as you want but the big thing is keep your paint very thin very thin if it's thick it won't flow and you'll work yourself to death trying to get it off that brush keep it simple add a little more thinner there you'll have another little stick it lives right here see you can just put his remaining Union as you want and just wherever and a lot of these little sticks help create interesting things that are happening in your painting there very nice very nice I tell you what let's take your two-inch birthday so often we avoid this big brush I'm gonna add a little brown to it dark Sienna just I want to put a little color in the bristles then I'm going to go right down here to the yellow right to the yellow only reason to put that them around in there is just to keep this yellow dull down some tap I'm tapping very firmly very feminist I'm gonna reach over here and grab a little SAP green throw in there too what the heck Sam green the yellow yellow ocher grab some Indian yellow okay let's go out up here now that I want to begin putting leaves out here on this beautiful little tree and take the corner of the brush and just tap just tap now work with patterns and shapes here just don't throw these on at random think about there's a limb in there that holds them up put your darker color on just like so just sort of work in little patterns here don't don't just throw them in at random I know sometimes it looks like there's no thought that goes into this you they just dropped on but each each little bush each tree is an individual he has his own personality they're like people they're different they're unique you have some that are big something to small tall and skinny ones fat ones they're just like people there see just layer after layer after layer and the more layers you have once again you get tired of hearing me say it the more depth you'll have in your painting and to me depth is very very important it will put a touch just a touch of the bright red with it just add something right in there just a happy little Bush okay now I'm going to grab another brush I have several of each brush good so I don't have to spend all my time washing brushes and we'll pull straight down here huh this is where you have to make the big decision pull straight down and go across hitting that fantastic instant reflections that easy that's easy okay yeah back into the CAD yellow using the same old dirty brush now there I'm gonna go over on this side and begin just dropping into indication here and there of all kinds of little green things little bushes little trees we don't have to define exactly what all of them are they're just pretty all kinds of little bushes but just the corner of the two-inch brush it's all you're using say all the yellows a little touch of red all kinds of little things just let them happen I don't have I'm gonna grab some alizarin crimson on the same brush shoot rather get quick let's go right up in here and we'll put a few little things right in here right in here touch it see just all different colors just let them very back and forth should we hit some greens and there Jack Frost is touch some of these it looks like it you're getting all of these beautiful little colors and shapes sometimes on one tree you could have a multitude of colors Justin unreal unreal there's a few little things just lives red out there I can't see okay I give you an idea of how you can make some super little things now let's take let's take some Van Dyck Brown here pull that paint out very flat glad as you can get it cut across a small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife let's go up here now then maybe there's some land that lives here just let that knife sort of bounce along and touch and play and you can make this quite thick quite thick like so see they're hidden and super and we take some dark Sienna little vendek brown and white and then just let that sort of bounce along here and that'll come right along and just put highlights all over it I could look like little stones and dirt Oh hands a little thanks now with a fan brush we can come right back we want to bring some grassy things down here so I'll just take a fan brush and load it full of the various colors that yellows the greens and all of those colors loaded quite full of paint okay let's go up here now take the corner and just push upward just push upward it'll make it look like a little grassy areas that are just flowing right down and a little more SAP green to that if you have trouble making it stick add a little tiny tiny bit of paint thinner to your brush see all the little things and that it kills those harsh edges brings everything together now then back to our liquid white on the knife and go right in here sit there and put us in some little a little water lines and just let them come right around here this is once again it's where you clean up the bottom of that bring it all together maybe there's a couple of them out in here and with a pointed knife go in here drop in a little sticks and twigs these to help create different planes and create the illusion of distance there we go good that's coming right along let's go back into our Van Dyck Brown and let's have some fun today maybe let's do something that maybe there's a little waterfall er comes out here so if there is watch here let's put some Brown in here got to have something to contain that water it comes right out OOP Van Dyck Brown yeah this little dark sienna in it whatever happens whatever look at that just right on down maybe there's some dirt out here where the whatever you can do anything on this canvas anything okay paint is quite thick and it's quite rough at this point shoot let's just keep going this fun may be waterfall we'll put it right in there so we'll bring this down right over like so just like so and this this you could put on with a paint roller it's no big deal I'm just putting a lot of color in here just like so yes like so thick paint very thick thick yeah now we have I have white titanium wine a little touch of the blue some of the dark Santa a little touch of the Van Dyck Brown but none of it's over mixed let's leave it very rough now I want to just sort of bounce this along just let it bounce let it bounce don't drag it straight let it bounce get rough say get nervous if you get if you got a little twitch you're ahead of the game right here I've had people in class tell me that their hand shakes and they can't do this shoot you too you've got an advantage use it music speaking of classes I get hundreds of letters want to know if we teach classes I'm I don't do too much teaching anymore we have teachers that we send all over the country and they'll come here I can teach my son Steve is one of those dough man gets lazy he sends them out last day at home now that we were going to have a little waterfall in there a little bit of the liquid height titanium point gonna reach up here and grab a little bit of blue just mix it all together let's go right up here maybe this water just comes right down through here just let it bounce right over there it comes their cars right down and it to see just a little waterfall like so yes I'd let that fall over there and I take the little knife and I'm gonna take just a little touch of the white paint just sort of let it skip along here see their head makes it look like water just barely apparently Bernie zipping her head over and with a fan brush and go right out here and just sort of clean up the bottom and let it pick up some of that color and work right on out here see a few little splashes here and there right oh now let's have some fun let's get crazy take a big bunch of the Van Dyck Brown the knife big bunch in my mind I want a tree hmm lives right there big tree boy he is a big tree big oak tree let's give him an arm here he's got an arm it lives right there I'll take some of the highlight color and just let it flow right down look it there see there hmm we'll take a little touch of green and we just put a little bit of grassy areas all down here by littlefoot's like so here and there that sort of pushes that waterfall back in there and with a little brown under there's a nice tree of those right here and drop a few little highlights on there see that easy this little round brush is something else just a few little highlights here in there and it helps push that waterfall back here pull this down and it will there see makes it look like rock sir okay now it's time to get crazy time to get crazy maybe there's some light to streams through here and back in here we have some nice bright leaves add a little white to that see my keys just Sparkle back here they're hanging down on the other side of the tree I should have done that first I got to go back there that'll push him on to the other side let's take some SAP green and a little brown load it onto the big breasts and let's put indication of all kinds of nice leaves and stuff that hang we over like this there they come just as many or as few as you want wherever you think they should live that's exactly where they belong okay great big old tree hmm and you're saying if you did all that work did he go in there and mess it up I think you'll like it I'm gonna add a little paint thinner to my brush we'll go right into some green and some yellow ocher load a lot of paint into the bristles a lot of paint let's go up here and then we can begin just tapping in some highlights don't overdo keep this quite dark it makes it very nice see there all kinds of little things just like so and you could go in here and drop in a few little dams and stuff and really make this look like a beautiful beautiful tree the old clock on the walls tell me it's time to leave you for this week so I'm going to call this painting finished and from all of us here happy painting god bless you production of this program is made possible
