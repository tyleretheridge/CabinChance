(soft music plays) - Hi, certainly glad
you could join us today. Thought today we could just
do a fun little painting and have a good time together. So let's start out and have them run off all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us at home. While they're doing that, let me show you what I got up here. I have my standard old
pre-stretched double primed canvas, and I just covered the entire canvas with a very, very thin even
coat of liquid white. So the canvas is all wet, and it's slick and ready
to go so let's just do it. Today, let's start out with this little bitty two inch brush. We'll go right into a
touch of the phthalo blue, a little phthalo blue, we
don't need much, just a little. There we go. Let's go right up here. Let's just start up here on the top, and just make little crisscross strokes. And we'll just work all
the way across the canvas, the colors continually
mixing with the liquid white. So it gets lighter and lighter
in value as you work down. And that's exactly what we're
looking for in a landscape. Something maybe, I don't
know, about like that. We'll leave a little area open. Maybe I'll put a cloud
there, what the heck. Maybe we'll put a little cloud there. Something like so. Isn't that easy? We got this happy little sky laid in. When we use this big old two inch brush, it really doesn't take too
long to paint a canvas. And now, the most fun part
of the whole procedure, and that's washing the brush. We have odorless paint thinner in the can, scrub the brush, shake it off. And just cover everybody in the studio. Alright. Now then. We'll take a two inch brush and I'll go right into a little
bit of the titanium white. Just load some into the
bristle, like so, maybe. Be right back. Put the least little
touch of pink into it, a little bit of bright red. There we go, let's go up in here. And we'll make a little
floater cloud today. Just by tapping like so. Get a little more color on the brush. There, just a little floater. And all we're doing is just tapping, tapping a basic little shape. That's all we're looking for. Something about like that. Just let it float around. There. Okay. Now that don't look too good yet. But we'll come back with
another two inch brush, just clean and dry, and very gently, look at that, look. See there, that easy. You can create gorgeous little
clouds, you can pull them. Once again, the liquid
white's under there, the canvas is wet, you can move paint right
across the surface. And that's one of the nicest, easiest ways I've ever seen of making
some little clouds. Okay, now then. Let's take, today, a little
bit of the lizarin crimson, we'll just mix these on the
brush, it doesn't matter. A little lizarin crimson,
a little phthalo blue. I'm looking for, maybe
a little lavender color. Be right back, I'm gonna reach down here and get a little white in there too. Ooh, isn't that a pretty color? Just tap, let's go up here. Maybe in our world, there lives some little trees
far back here in the distance, and I'm just using the top
corner of the brush, cover that. It's just indications. I don't want a lot of
detail, too far away. Too far away, just little distant trees that live back here and have a good time. These are just happy little
trees, fun little things. There we go. All you're looking for is basic shape and form, very loose. Something maybe about like heaven. Then you can wash the brush, I just want an excuse to wash the brush. Shake it off. Back in business, clean, dry brush. Now I'm just going to tap the base of it, to create the illusion of mist. I want it to be very soft down towards the bottom, very, very soft. There we are. Now then, I'll just
use the same old brush. We'll take a little sap green, a little bit of cadmium yellow, a little yellow ochre mixed together. I'm looking for a nice... Ooh, that's what I'm looking for, just a nice green there,
and just go up in here. Now then, maybe there's
another layer of little bushes. Nah, want it to look a little greener, add a little more sap green. Yeah, that's better. So, if you're not happy
with something, change it. Because this piece of
canvas is truly your world. And you can do anything here, anything, that your heart desires. There we go, see there? Just indications of other
little bushes that live in here. Something like that. And then with a clean brush, once again, you're going to tap, to create that illusion of mist. Very soft, very gentle. Quiet little pose. Go back to the brush and
add green on the side. Go right into the dark sienna, a little van dyke brown,
but mostly dark sienna. Tap it again, just tap. Go right back up here. So, I'm creating different planes in the painting, different layers. Just want to create a lot of depth in the background, something like that. There we go, you can come right on down, I don't know, wherever you want it to go. See, already we have three different layers of little things. Take a liner brush, a
little bit of paint thinner, and you can just here and there, don't want a lot, it's too far away. Put the little indication of a few little sticks and twigs that show. But not a lot though, don't overdo, it's too far away. Too far away, something like that. Something like that, there. Very gentle, okay. Now. Got to decide what we're
going to have down here. I think, down here... Let's put, today, some
very, very dark water. Very dark, I'm gonna go into pure midnight black and prussian blue, as dark as I can get it. Then I'm gonna go up in here, and just... Dark water, prussian
blue, and midnight black. Just really, really, really go in there. Don't be afraid of it, because anything we don't like, we just cover with paint
over it, no big deal. It's one great thing about oils, oils are the most
forgiving medium there is, the most forgiving medium. When I was in college taking art, I took classes in watercolor, for example, it's a gorgeous medium. But college taught me two things. First of all, it wasn't my medium. And secondly, super, super respect for those who can do it. I stuck with oils
because they are so easy. And as I said, they're
very, very forgiving. And I need all the forgiveness I can get. Alright, we'll go into van dyke
brown, a little dark sienna, I'm just mixing them together, but mostly van dyke in this case. Our little roll of paint,
we'll go right up in here. And maybe, yep. Maybe there's a little
bank that lives right here, just a little bank, river bank. There. See there, just drop in a basic shape. Oops, dropped the old knife. that's alright, got
another one right here. Just keep right on going. Alright, now then. Find a brush here. Get one that's got a little bit of, a little bit of sap green,
a little bit of the... Little touch of cad yellow, gonna get a little more of that sap green. Like that, just load it full. Just load it full, let's go right up here. And maybe up here, we'll put just an indication of some little things that are growing. Right up in here, little grassy areas, little tiny grass areas. I'm gonna add a little
bit of paint thinner, a little bit of paint thinner. Now then, I want to make this look like little banks
that are hanging over. So to do that, we just
sort of bring that around. Just like so. There, get a little more paint. There. But that creates the lay
of the land back here. Take a little white, a little
bit of that brown color. We'll mix it up so it's sort of marbly. In here and there, we
can put the indication of little stones, or whatever
that lives back in here. Now then, let's get crazy. Maybe there's a... big bank that lives out here. I want to create a lot of
planes in this painting. Sort of lean back, take a look. Take a deep breath and jump in there. Don't be afraid of it. You know, the worst thing that can happen, when you're painting with oils, is that you have to scrape
it off and paint it again. But that's not a big deal. As I said earlier, oils are the most forgiving medium. And if you make a mistake, you just take it off, use it again, go on about your business. So, all we're doing here is just putting in a lot of good dark color, good van dyke brown, dark
sienna mixed together. In fact, you could have probably done this painting using the black gesso and had all this area done in black. But it'll work just as well. Just however you want to
do it, it's up to you. There we go. Got a hair right there, we'll get it off. Very gently. Think about how you want this embankment here to go, though. I'm gonna put some grass on it too, but I want it to look like it comes over. Maybe in some places it'll
comes almost straight down and then pull out, it's up to you. But very little pressure on the knife, just let it sort of bounce, so it hits here and
there, and there and here. Maybe a little touch of the bright red. Ooh, I like that. Like that, just enough to
give it a little flavor. You know what we need back here on this big bank? Let's have a few trees. I like to paint evergreens. So, let me clean off this spot. We'll take prussian blue, midnight black, and also that phthalo green. I like phthalo green in
everygreens sometimes. Crimson, a little van dyke, makes a pretty good pile
of color though because we're going to load
some brushes quite deep. There, wipe the old knife off. Let's find a once inch brush. Alright, load the bristle full of color, wiggle them, that wiggly pulls the color down to the end of the bristles. Just pulls it down and sharpen it. Alright, let's go up here. And maybe in our world there lives a little evergreen tree
right there, right there. Let me load that paint back up again. Give it a little upward push, working from side to side, there it comes, just push upward. Give it a push. That's one of the easiest ways there is, making a nice little tree. And we're not worried much right now, except about basic shape. We're going to come back, I know we're worried
about the top at that, we're going to come back and put in all kinds of little highlights. But right now, all we're worried about, is just the outside edges
and stuff that will show. Put a dark, rich color in there. Hmm, that's fantastic. Maybe there's a big one up here, we don't even know where it goes. To find out where it goes, we'd have to nail another
canvas on top of this one. Right, there it is. It goes right on out like that. Maybe he's got a little
friend right there, wherever you want him. Let's have one more, just
to fill it all up here. Let me load the brush back full of color. And we'll go right in here. See there? Now we got a whole
forest sitting back here. And in your world, you put as many or as
few trees as you want. It's up to you, totally
and completely up to you. Okay, I'll just use that same old brush. I'm going to go right
into a little cad yellow, yellow ochre, indian
yellow, making a green. Load the brush the same way. Let's go back up here. Now we can come back in here, and begin putting a few
highlights here and there. Some there. Just a few highlights. I'm going to add a little paint thinner. So let's take a little bit, oh yeah. See, that comes off a lot better. If you have trouble
making the paint come off, then just add a little paint thinner. This one needs a little thinner. Leave some of these dark areas, don't kill them all, darker, darker, darker. This old big boy, he comes
right on off into nowhere. Something about like that. There he goes. Darker, darker, darker
down here towards the base. This one back here, almost nothing. We want him to stay way
back in the background. There is one. There we go. Let's wash the little brush out. Just don't get to beat on these
little brushes very often, and they're just about as fun
as the big ones, not quite. It doesn't do as much to get the camerman as the other ones do. Now, maybe in here we
got some nice bushes. So, let's mix up a color. And for that, we'll just pile it up here. We may use that later. Let's take, we'll use a phthalo blue, and a lizarin crimson. Proportionately much, much more crimson, much more crimson than blue, or maybe a little bit more crimson there. Alright, then I want to add a little white to it. Ooh, that's nice. Okay, take the brush and
dip it into liquid white. Because you know our rule, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. The liquid white is only there to thin it. Pull the brush in one direction. Load it full, let's go up in here. And maybe back in here we have some gorgeous little lavender bushes. Maybe I"ll make them a little brighter so they show up a little better for TV. Okay, there it is. Look at that though. I like these little devils. Maybe a little one lives right there. Maybe, maybe in our world. Yep, let's have another
one right over in here. You just put them wherever
you think they should be. It's up to you, totally
and completely up to you. Just little tips out here. I like to use the liquid white to make little tips so they shine. Darker, darker, darker. We'll go into a little bit a phthalo blue and maybe got a little bush right here, it's got a little blue in it. Just something to break up the flavor. Maybe take a little yellow ochre, and maybe we have right up here, maybe right in here there's a, yep, just a pretty little bush that lives right there in a different color. Well, this is turning into a very colorful little painting, I like it. We'll use our little two inch brush, and let's have a little green on it. And we'll just put some
little grassy areas that come right down this embankment. See there. Have the come out almost straight, let them come over, let some of these things
just hang over the side. Get a little bit more of
that sap green on there. Just let them hang right over. All kinds of things going off in here. I like it. Just scratch in a few little sticks and twigs just using the knife. Lift them up, pull them
down, it doesn't matter. Whatever makes you happy. While I got that old knife let's take, let's take some white, I'm going to put some phthalo blue in it, just to make a nice gorgeous blue. Phthalo blue is such a beautiful color. There, something about like that, tiny little roll of paint. Maybe we got some little, little things that are
happening right along in here. Just barely graze it, let it just slide. Just barely run, barely touch it. I want that paint just
to pull off the knife, and make it look like watery things are happening all down through there. There we go. Alright. We need something over here on the sides. Isn't that a neat way though? Just making some nice little watery areas. Maybe over here, let me
grab some more brown. Yep, you're right, over here, maybe there's a peninsula, or a little point of land
that comes right out. Like that. Just right about like that. And we'll take a little brown and white just like we used to. Just let it travel right down. Let's use a little
bright red in there too, just to make it look like old dirt, rocks, stones, whatever's
out here, we don't care. Maybe there's some little
grassy areas right out here. I don't know. Let your imagination go, take you wherever you want to go. There, just some little
happy things live in there. Take a little touch of the liquid white, go in some greens, some yellows. Let's have a little
bush, lives right there. Little tiny bush, cute little devil. Alright. I like that. Tell you what, let's do , take a little
more of that blue and white, and let's just bring it
right around the edges here. See there, let it come
right around like this, water just traveling right on down. There. Some very, very easy way of
making some effective water. Let's use some green, some
brown, a little bit of blue. Gonna have a bush right here. So to do that, you need
to put some dark color in. Maybe it comes all the way on out. I don't know. Okay, we'll go into a
little bit of sap green, a little yellow, there we are. Put some highlights on this little rascal. You know, we travel all over the country and we do shows for PBS stations, and they're call brush
and brunch with Bob. Recently I did one, I think I was in Knoxville, Tennessee, and I met one of the
cutest young fellows there, and he came up on the stage with me, and he whispered in my ear
and he said, "Bob, bob." And I said "Yeah?" He said, "Beat the devil out of it." He was probably about, oh I don't know, seven or eight years old, just the nicest young fellow, think his name was Owen. But just, super young guy, I enjoyed meeting him very much. But if we get to your town doing one of these brush and brunches, please come out and see us. I'd love to meet you and talk with you, and most importantly, it helps support your
public television station. And they need your help. Okay, tell you what, let's do... Let's have some fun. Let's take some brown, put
a paint thinner with it. I'm gonna mix up, real thin. I want to make a nice thin color. Grab just van dyke brown. Then we'll take, oh, I'll use some brown and
white overhead up here. Put some paint thinner with that. So they're both quite thin. We have one dark, and
one quite a bit lighter. Take the little filbert brush, go right through the dark
color, on both sides. Then I'll go through the
light, on only one side. I'm going to go up here, I'm going to put the indication of just all kinds of little domes and rocks. Maybe some live out here in the water. I don't know, wherever you want them. Over in here, maybe we got some big ones that live out here in these... It's a nice way of making a lot of stones very rapidly, because you can make them in one stroke. Just drop them in. There. Maybe there's a whole patch of them here. There we go. However many you think there should be. While we got that old brush going, let's put some van dyke brown on it. Maybe up in here... We'll put a nice little
tree that lives right there. There he is. Grab my little lighter brush, put some arms on him, trees need some arms too. Just give him a few little arms. Just a happy little
tree that lives up here, overlooks this little
stream that just flows by. Maybe he's not doing so good and he doesn't have any leaves on him. So we'll just let him look right there, he's sort of a naked tree. Maybe over in here, just a couple of little ones. There, there's some
very quiet little trees. I think with that we've got
to have a finished painting. Hope you've enjoyed this one, it's one that you can do, I'd like to hear how you do with it. So, from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless my friend. (light music plays)
