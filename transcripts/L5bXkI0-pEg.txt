- Welcome back. Glad to see ya today. You know in every series, there has to be a crazy day, and this is our crazy day. So, we thought we'd do a painting that's really far out and that maybe it'll excite the imagination. We're gonna have a little
campfire down here, and all the big trees around. We'll just sort of see what happens. And, I've taken a black canvas, that was painted with
a flat, black acrylic, that was allowed to dry. And then covered the entire
canvas with alizarin crimson. So, let's go. Let's start out with cad yellow, on the one inch brush. And decide where you want the
little campfire to be here. And we'll start, let's put it right there. And just start making little
x's or criss-cross strokes. And working around, there we go. And just let this go. Go all the way out to
the edges of the canvas, even if you can't see
anything happening, let it go. 'Cause little things are happening, it's picking up the color. There, just all the way out. Just these little
criss-cross, x type strokes. There. Now, you can make this
as bright as you want it, but each time, clean and dry your brush, before you go back into the center. You want that to be the
brightest area in the painting. So we'll clean the brush, beat it dry. And add a little bit
more of the cad yellow. Go right back in here. And just lay in some color. And then begin working outward again. That way, automatically, it gets darker as it goes farther away from the little campfire
that's gonna be here. All right. There we go. Now, clean this brush up, and we're ready to get serious with this. Mm-kay, with a large brush, I'm just gonna begin blending this out. There. Just very gently still making the little criss-cross strokes. Working outward. You don't want to bring a dirty brush back to the center. Don't want to ruin the beautiful, bright color you have right there. Mm-kay. And then very gently, we take the brush strokes out just by going across the canvas. All right. And we're gonna try to show you some things today that are a little different than anything
we've done in the past. So, hope you'll enjoy this one. Let's take the fan brush, we'll put some Van Dyke brown on it, and a little bit of crimson. Van Dyke brown, touch of crimson. Just mix them on the brush. And maybe way back here in the distance, we can just see the trunks of some trees, and just let 'em sort of disappear. These are just some little
trees in the background. Just sort of let 'em disappear. Maybe, right here, maybe
there's a bigger one, so we just push a little harder, and just let it disappear. And we can put a little
limb out here on him. He wants a little arm. And all wherever you want 'em here, you can just put little indications. Just far away. All kinds of little things happening. There we are. Like so. Now, let's take a one inch brush, and we'll put Van Dyke brown, and alizarin crimson
on the one inch brush. Load it full of paint. And we can begin applying
some little leaves back here. And all we're doin' is
just touching the canvas, bending the brush a little bit. All we're looking for is just
very basic, gentle shapes. We're not looking for a lot of detail. These are just little background
trees that are far away. So, just wherever you think there might be some leaves, just drop 'em in. Don't really spend a lot
of time worried about it. Maybe there's a little bush right there, that just sort of graduates into nothing. The glow of the fire, here, will take care of the
bottom of all of these, so don't worry about 'em. Mm-kay, now we can take, and let's add a little bit, then just a tiny bit here, a little yellow ochre, Indian
yellow, mixed together. And we can just highlight some of these, where the light's strikin'
'em from the fire. And just picking out
little individual things and drop some little highlights
on 'em, here and there. Don't overdo 'em. Keep it quite subdued. Little yellow ochre, Indian
yellow, mixed together. Once again, these are just gonna be background trees, far away. So, we don't have to spend a lot of time worrying about 'em or trying to make 'em perfect. Just a tiny bit over here. Not as much. Tiniest little bit. Just some indications. There we go. Now we can have fun. I'm gonna take the large brush, and very gently, I'm just
gonna blend all of this in. I want it to be very
soft, and very far away. So, let's go right up here and watch. Very gently. Just still making the
little criss-cross strokes. Just begin blending all of it. Just let it blend away. Mm-kay, now we just take
the brush strokes out by just going across. See how far away that looks already? Hm, ain't that fantastic? I didn't put any highlights on this one little bush that I laid right here. So let's put a few
little highlights on him. Don't want him to get upset
because we didn't have any. And then we'll just very
gently blend him also. There. Now, we can use this big brush and begin adding all
kinds of little things that are happening around here. Maybe right in here there's some nice little bushes that are growing. And just drop in some basic shapes. We're not too worried about detail yet. There's one. Just let 'em fall right off your brush. Maybe as we get farther away here, maybe there's some great, big trees, that are going to be growing over in here. Great big oaks. Just drop 'em in. Still using just crimson
and Van Dyke brown. There we are. Just give it some nice basic
little shapes to work with. Now, then, we can start
playing a little bit. Let's take Indian yellow
and permanent red, and just mix it together. And let's begin dropping
some little highlights right up in here. Just let 'em sparkle. Think where the light would hit 'em. There we go. Maybe a little bit up in here. There. Mm-kay, that's Indian yellow and a touch of permanent red. Right there. 'Kay, maybe right here
there's another one. Now, as they get farther
away from the fire, less and less you're gonna see. Back in here, we're just going to begin putting a little bit of stuff, but don't worry too much
about highlights back in here. Like so. Just sort of let 'em disappear. Little bit up here. Then it just disappears. Just enough to set 'em off a little bit, so you can see 'em. There we go. This little one lives right there. There. Let's go right up in here, and play with the fire a little bit. Hm, I got in trouble for playing in fire when I was young. Today we can do it. Gonna take a little bit of Van Dyke brown and we'll just make
some little indications of some wood here. And, it's all burnt, it can be just about any old way that you want it. There. And then let's, maybe there's some ground area, right down through here that we can see. Still Van Dyke brown. And just pull it across. Just pull it. Like that. Now, take a little bit of yellow ochre, and burnt umber, mixed together. And we can put a little bit of highlight right out here. And start here and work down, so it gets darker automatically, 'cause you're running out of paint. And you're picking up more and more of the under color. Let the canvas work for ya. Now, tell you what, let's put a little fire right here. I'm just using a little bit of cad yellow. And just touch, and just give a indication
of a little bit of fire. Little small campfire. There we go. That's enough to convey what
we're trying to show here. Now, take the fan brush, and we'll use a little
bit of the yellow ochre, Indian yellow, and permanent red, all mixed together on the fan brush. And mix 'em on the brush. And we can begin laying in some little grassy areas here. Little bit brighter up here by the fire. So start at the brightest area, and work downward. Want these to be very soft. Just where the light's striking 'em, get darker, darker, darker. There, dark up here. And we can just lay in all kinds of happy little things. Maybe right along here. There. 'Kay, there's one that comes way down. It's your world, so you can
put 'em anywhere you want 'em. There we go. Just down like so. There's a good place for a couple more. Now maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, we wanna take and add a little bit more of the Van Dyke brown right in here. I know what we should do. Maybe this is a little lake out here. You know, if you're gonna
build a little campfire, you need to have water close by. So we put a little cad
yellow on the large brush, go right here, touch, and pull straight down. 'Kay? Just a little. Touch. Pull straight down. And it's gonna pick up the crimson that's underneath and turn
a beautiful reddish color. Work from the lightest area, which would be directly
under the fire, out. That way automatically, as
you go away from the fire, it gets darker and darker. And very gently, come across. Just very gently. Don't want to kill all these nice lines that you put in there. Just make 'em just look like water. Maybe there's a little projection that comes right out through here. We'll just add a little
bit more of the brown. Bring it right on out. Drop a little bit of the
highlight color on it. There we go. And we go back to our little fan brush. Yellow ochre, Indian yellow
and a touch of permanent red. And we can just drop in some little grassy things that
are growin' down this hill. Now, I think I've mentioned it earlier, but in case you missed it, if you have questions or comments, or something we can help you with, please feel free to drop us a line. We'd like to know what you want. We'd like to know what
you want in future series. What type of things interest you. A lot of the paintings in this series, have come from letters
that people have wrote and told us what they wanted to see. Mm-kay, let me clean up a big brush here. And let's play a little bit. (sloshing water) Mm-kay. (thwacking) That's still fun. Okay, I want to subdue all of this. It's much too bright. So with a large brush, very gently, I'm just gonna begin blending it. Very gently. Just let it barely touch. Make it very quiet, push it way back. 'Cause you wouldn't see
all this much brighten. It's dark. So we just want to subdue it here. Very quiet. Subdued. Very quietly, just blend it. 'Cause you know, when you have the little
campfire out there at night, things almost, they almost look unreal. You get all kind of
weird colors and shapes. They're beautiful. There we go. Clean up that reflection
there a little bit. I'm gonna take a tiny bit of the yellow, and put a little bit
of reflection into this little projection right here. Pull it straight down. Just come across. Like so. But you see how quiet
that makes that look. It's very, very quiet. Let's go right up in here, and maybe, maybe there's a big, great big tree, right here. Right here, big son of a gun. He just goes all the way off the canvas. There we are. And you can make your trees as big or as small as you want to. Okay, this is just
straight Van Dyke brown. There we go. Big strong tree. I love to paint trees, they're one of the most fantastic things in nature to me. 'Kay, give him a little
arm, or limb, up here. There we go. Like so. Now we can take a little
bit of permanent red, and sort of highlight this tree. This is permanent red with
a little burnt umber in it. And then we can lay
some highlights on here. Just where you think
the light from the fire would strike the tree. Use your imagination. Let your heart take you wherever you want to go. There we are. Maybe a little highlight playing on this limb up here. Maybe there's an old
fella sittin' out here, warmin' his foots next to the fire. Maybe we'll have a cowboy out here. We'll put him a hat on. So, we just start right here, with a little edge of the knife. And just sort of come around, we can just sort of see part of him. He's leanin' up against the tree. There's his old... the brim of his hat. Little top of his hat. And at home when you have unlimited time, you can take a lot more
time and effort with this, and really go into some detail. Maybe he's sort of slumped over and there's his shoulder comin' down. And maybe there's an arm Okay, there we go. Maybe he sort of got his
foot stickin' up like that. There's his leg. And these are just very
basic little things. So I say at home, you can take your time and put a lot of detail into these. Just want to give you ideas here. Okay, now we can sort of straighten him out a little bit. Better give him some buns to sit on. There we go. Give him a little foots. Maybe his hand's just restin' on his knee. See, I should have put him in before I put the highlights on the tree, I've messed my highlights up. But that's easy. We'll just go back and drop our highlights right back in. There we are. So the tree stands, stands away from the guy a little bit. And we can take a little
bit of the yellow ochre, and think where light would strike here. Maybe a little bit on his
hat right there, like so. Maybe a little comin' around. Just a little, right there. Maybe a little bit across
the top of the shoulder. You know, I gotta tell
a little story here. We have a lot of requests that have came in wanting portraits. And years ago, I studied
with a super, super painter, and studied portraits, for oh, maybe a year and half, two years. And he became a very dear friend. And he took me aside
one night and he says, "Bob," he says, "I've got
to tell you the truth." He said, "I want you to go
and paint bushes and trees, 'cause that's where your heart is, and give up portraits." So, that's why I'm here. There we go. Just maybe a little highlight
bouncin' across there. Little bit on his knee. That really is a true story, too. He really did tell me I
should give up portraits. Takes a special knack. You know, we talk about
that sometime, about talent. What is talent? Talent is nothing more
than a pursued interest. In other words, things
that you're interested in, you'll spend a lot more time working at, than something you're not interested in. So that's all talent is. It's if you're willing to practice, spend the time to perfect something. Let me clean up the brush a little bit. (water sloshing) (thwacking) (chuckles) There we go. We can just soften all
this, just very gently. Very, very gently. And we can come down here, use a little bit of the dark color, and put a little tiny bit of a
waterline indication in here. Just a small amount. This is really a fun little painting. It should give you a lot of ideas for a lot of crazy things that you can do. And this should make you happy. We really want painting to make you happy. That's what it's all about. Okay, and I can just quiet this down a little
bit over in the corner. Like so. Now if you want to create
a little more depth here, then you can add maybe, maybe there's another little bush here, that comes in front of the tree. And this will produce, every plane that you
add into the painting, will produce a little bit more depth. Mm-kay, we'll take a little bit of the Indian yellow, permanent red, and we can put some highlights on this little bush. Push everything back a little farther. I think we're about to
get this one fixed up. We might put a few little leaves right up here. Just to show that this one goes into a nice, big tree. Little bit of the color. Indian yellow, permanent red. And just drop it in. Now if you really want to have some fun, you could take the liner brush, with a little bit of thin color on it, and sorta go over some of
these little logs here, and make 'em stand out,
just a little more, 'cause there'd be a lot
of light hitting these. And we can fix him up a little. And all we want's an indication that there's an old fella, sittin' out here, warmin' his foots. There we go. All right, looks sort of
like an old guy out here, just silhouetted against the campfire. And I think this one's
about ready for a signature. So let's take, put a signature, right about here. Yeah, there comes a time when you can just absolutely piddle a painting to death. 'Kay, there we are. And we have that one all signed. Now, next week, I wanna show ya a
fantastic little painting that I think will just
tickle you to death. So have your canvas set up, we'll be doing a white canvas. I think that you'll really enjoy it. And, you know, talk for just a second. We would really like to hear from you and know what type of paintings that you would like to see in the future. So drop us a line, in care of, WIPB, Muncie, Indiana. And we'll be glad to answer any question. And we'll try to put together shows that supply you with the type paintings that you want to see. We also would like to someday, put together a show where we bring on guest artists from all over the country. And let them show you a multitude of different effects that you can try, that you can enjoy, that do good things to your heart. So, we're looking forward
to doing this for you, anything else that you would like to see. On behalf of all of us
here at the station, we'd like to wish each and
every one of you happy painting. We hope you have a super day. God bless. Take care. Bye bye. (smooth jazz music)
