taking up any more time I'd like to welcome you to the joy of painting and thank you for being with us today Ben well thank you very much Bob it was very nice introduction I want to get right into this painting I'm gonna do a girl's head I don't use models so what I do is I make drawings I make a lot of drawings beforehand and here are an example of some of the drawings which will be turned from drawing into paintings on this canvas I try to get all the bugs out of the and the problems out of it by doing this first and I've decided on using preps this little drawing up here to be the head that I intend to use next could I talk about color on the palette in the world we have a world we have earth and we have sky so I use numbers and Siena's Brasi amaz and red the Reds as Earth colors and the green of course is earth but the blue part is sky then everything in nature is hot or cold and various degrees in between but basically everything is hot or cold now I start out with a cold raw burnt umber cold raw umber is warm burnt sienna is cold raw Sienna is warm and then a lemon yellow which is cool but I mix lemon yellow with the red here and I get a beautiful cadmium yellow which takes care of the warm yellow then of course the Vermillion the coal the warm red and then alizarin crimson cold and then cerulean blue which is actually warm there's a lot of warmth in cerulean blue there's a lot of sunlight and air and atmosphere in cerulean blue and it seems to be in just about every place throughout the earth world then the cold one is outer space you might call it and that's the cobalt it's very deep strong I have a green here it's called maximum green 8 which mixed with any of the colors provides a magnificent array of greens better than any kind of green I've ever seen or used that's my palette now I do use other colors occasionally flesh tint that's the fun of use I use it for everything except flesh but it's a beautiful color now so use Naples yellow but this for this palette I wanted to keep it as simple as possible so now I'll start painting and wish me luck it goes I have toned the canvas I always tone a canvas first it kills the awful strong white of the canvas things look better painting against a tone then painting against white pure white now this is black I didn't mention I use black here black Renoir called the queen of all colors and Monet said he'd never used black when they asked how come you get such beautiful colors I'd never used black so that's the way it goes in painting well I mentioned earlier that I did not use models but that is based on many years of using models and drawing from a model and studying very hard practicing drawing very hard and it it isn't surprising at all that men like daga Rubens and great masters of the past Raphael all the rest Michelangelo they drew from imagination and it seems to me the drawing drawing these days is almost a lost art people are drawing like they used to and especially the people who are just starting out drawing can be more fun than painting and if you could do things with a drawing that you can't do with painting you get the essence of the thing simple fast quick and I recommend that anybody taking up painting for the first time should start out doing a lot of drawings now here's the thing in this painting and see how I smear in the lips you don't have to draw outline lips outline eyes outline the face kids and different things but do a a general overall I call it just a smear like I'm starting out this business of the head I don't know exactly what I'm going to do in fact Digga once mentioned he said that an artist does his work best work when he doesn't know what he's doing because and the reason for that is that art is largely instinctive it's instinct based on training and practice it's the way a pianist hits the right keys on the piano instinct but it's based on study and raffio once said about drawing he said when one doesn't think when one is drawing it works out better that way now those are two the very very great grass draftsman I have used spray glaze on the background of this pain and killed all of the whites the lights that are strong because they're too harsh it's better to work into a toned colored a good way to do is spray the with fixed if I rather spray the canvas with well in this case I use frag ways but you can also mix a retouch paint the stuff they used a lighter lighter fluid use lighter fluid instead of turpentine and it dries very rapidly or does tone your canvas with a mixture of turpentine and paint and then work into it now you notice how I try to establish the big effect of the thing first you don't start with some detail you start with a big effect then you can carry this if I wanted to I can spend another week on this painting and go all into detail it would explain everything detail but I like to do things as suggest things and I'm just sort of suggesting and strengthening under that chin I feel the main job of an artist is to find the things in nature that the average person cannot see then put them on canvas but doing a better job than of art the nature why because nature is everything except an artist only a human can appreciate art and only a human can create art the trouble is too many artists merely copied nature's work instead of creating art based on nature based on nature's rules and if you study nature not only just what it is what it looks like but why it looks that way and then you paint exactly in the same manner another point I'd like to make is it's on watching demonstration such as this if you want to improve don't just sit back and watch a demonstration in the same way you watch a magician perform try to analyze why and how he did it you yourself must become your own best teacher and avoid like the plague of painters methods and results which are closer to Houdini than they are to Rembrandt in other words avoid trickery do it the hard way do it the traditional way the way painters have been painting for centuries now as I'm painting I'm doing all this instinctively I I feel a need for something and then I fulfill it with a stroke of the brush or a smear of colors and for heaven's sake don't paint pretty that can be the death knell for any work of art prettiness sugar-coated pictures develop taste and you develop taste only by going to the great the museum and studying the Masters taking a look at masters work here I'm using spray glaze and it puts a tint of color over the into the wet paint artists have been you see that yellow the glaze of yellow shooting all into that thing this is an oil-based paint itself you can use it with watercolor or any color pastel works equally well and artists have been using glazes for years that's how the old masters got luminosity into the things but this spray glaze allows but they had a glaze into dry paint canvas had to be dry for about two or three weeks but with spray glaze you can glaze and spray right into wet paint and colors will happen that'll are just fantastic it's generally wise to paint with hot colors below and cool colors on top for instance a tree the green out of a tree is living it's warm the human body is warm and the colors you put into it are warm underneath and the colors of nature puts into a living thing our warm underneath on top is sky color that's the coolness so as you paint paint warm especially in the case of flesh paint warm flesh and then paint your cool colors on top of that this is why it's so important to lay out your palette with warm and cold colors take a look at Rembrandt the way he used cold combinations of cold and warm it's very effective the object of painting is to make a picture look good that you should study and take advantage of all the things that make it look good but without making it look tricky bread's also I might say you learn to paint by painting and you learn to draw which is almost a lost art these days by drawing but you only learn how to understand what art is all about is by studying great arts and looking at nature not so much what she is or what she looks like but how she works this is the aspect of nature and artists must imitate most of all and don't be conned into believing a painting is good because as marvelous detail or slick clever and flamboyantly rendered remember a whisper can be more potent than a shout and that like nature good art tells no story or at least merely uses story as a means not an end now I'm beginning to fill in I've got the headaches established but I'm working in some interesting stuff into the background and you can use any kind of color in anything nature uses color on everything don't think I say an orange is orange it has to be orange you can paint a purple orange underlying all things its form that's the most important thing far more important than color a great painting by Renoir and black and white is just as great and black and white as it is in color it goes for any of them be creative try to create new forms make everything you paint your own not nature's not somebody else's make it your own if you paint leaves on a tree make them your own leaves make them the kind of leaves that nobody ever saw before but yet everybody will know their leaves this is the real interest in learning to paint and an art makes art art line is very important line in relationship to tone flat areas of tone and this is why I'm putting in this line it creates more interest in an orchestra tone would be that trumpets and the tubas and that sort of thing but line would be the flutes and strings and if you listen to great music you'll see the way composers have used line strings and flutes the strings woven through the tonality in the deep flat areas and an artist must do the same and you can learn a lot about painting by studying music and a lot of musicians can learn a lot about music music by studying great paintings you notice how these little flecks of color I hid in there like they're just dancing like fireflies in the night and use a palette bag as you see here in your fingernails and your fingers but a palette knife is very good it's also fine for scraping out areas and sometimes you'll scrape out the area and it will look a lot better after you scraped it out and scumble and very your brushstrokes don't have don't make two brushstrokes alike on a canvas keep twisting that brush in your fingers like I'm doing now make it work for you and constantly be all excited about what you're doing at the start you're gonna have a lot of trouble you're gonna have more failures than good ones but it's the only way if you want to play on a miniature golf course or your life and paint ordinary paintings okay that's not for you you want to get on that big 18 hole golf course and do a big job a real thing and use paint pile paint on in one area and work at thin in other areas there it is variations don't do anything the same way twice now you see I'm using my fingernail to soften something if you look at a great paintings and especially in the impressionist you'll see their fingerprints all over the thing or they'll take a piece of rag and slap it against the painting and pull it away well it's almost finished still working with it there's getting a little more form now a good idea for instance of painting such as this I would leave I might leave it as it is get a frame and say it's finished but sometimes I'd come back to it and carry it further but you must get the big masses this lesson that I've done today in this case is a good example of how to lay in the painting and art the more you get into it the more you get into it it gets more difficult and gets tougher all the time and as Degas said one time he says if it wasn't so difficult if it were not so difficult wouldn't be fun so go at it the difficult way and have fun notice how Scratchy to the canvas texture I didn't even talk to start talking about texture but that's very important look into textures in nature and line could be white and light lines as well as dark lines such as their smoothing out that hair it was little rough should be darker but learn how to do things it can't economically don't make a big fuss over things you can do it in one stroke do it in one stroke that's a little repair work softening an edge with my finger and notice I used very little paint on the face itself but the best thing I can say is draw draw draw well I just see about my time is about up I can spend another week on this but this is sort of at least it shows you how to lay in the painting anyway and as you can see I've thrown color around with abandon and form but the important thing is to see that I got in a relationship of tone to line you in a painting you work tone to line and suddenly things begin to happen that are interesting because that's really the basic form of painting is that line and tone combination along with values and all the rest but so many students seem to forget they paid too much just pure in tone which is flat tone and not enough of these lines to delineate form so we'll just sort of list this thing would go I can't think of anything more to say on the subject or paint on the subject but this is it thank you for watching now didn't I tell you this man was fantastic this is truly why they call Ben stall one of the Masters and from all of us here at the joy of painting I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and we'll see you again thank you you
