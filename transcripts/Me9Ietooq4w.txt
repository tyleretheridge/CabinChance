all right welcome back I'm glad you could join me today it's a fantastic day here and I hope it is where you're at so I'm glad you here and I hope you do a little painting with us and enjoy it as much as we do let's start out today and haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and as usual they'll come across in the same orders I have them on the palette starting with a white and working around and I have my standard oak canvas up here and I've already covered it with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white so it's ready to go so let's go let's just do a happy little painting today it's such a it's such a beautiful day we'll start with a little touch of the phthalo blue we just use the old two-inch brush tap a little color into it just pull a little color out and tap the brush into it that but make sure you got a nice even distribution of color see all the way through the bristles okay now then let's go right up in here and we'll just use the little just happy little strokes just little X's little crisscross strokes and let's just drop in some beautiful little little sky shapes here just sort of let it happen let it happen there see how easy it is to put in the sky doesn't take for just a second when you using a big old brush there are we going this today let's have a little water in the painting I'm Oh absolute fanatic for water I love it there how we have this color on the brush nice add just a tiny bit more same color and to say well we know water is going to be on the bottom down here but other than that we don't care right now we'll just put a little bit of a little blue right in there right in there then from here notice that we're pulling from the outside and that leaves that little light area here if everything works out just right that'll look just like little sheen of light coming across your paint makes it sort of pretty and very very lightly we'll just go over the entire canvas smooths everything out but that little lighter you it stays in there take the same thing in the sky here we just sort of blend it together a little bit but I've left some holes in the sky some light areas thought today we're putting it put in some happy little clouds okay I'll wash this old brush that's the fun part of this this is this is where you take out all of your frustrations and hostilities give it a good shaking just beat the devil out of it now when you're doing that at home you might want to invest a couple bucks a tie and a brush beater rag because you'll absolutely change the appearance of your whole house and about one beat and then you won't be upset with me let's take let's take some black oh and there it is a little bit of blue black and blue black and blue but a little bit of white there so we can see what we got I'm looking for a nice bluish gray color maybe a little more of a white there that's nice nice and we're going to use that to put a put a few shadows in our cloud today I'm just going to use the round brush today you can use the old round brush to do all kinds of things just pull it through there and get a little color on it maybe just the corner of the brush but just put the indication right looks like a big little storm there there just scrub in the indication of some shadows decide where your big clouds are gonna live and we're just throw any few shadows they were gonna come back with them put some highlights will turn these over make violent looking clouds into heavy lower clouds there we are but just start a little circular patterns when I'm working with clouds I always try to use circular patterns for everything I do I use a little down here wherever I have a couple of these old round brushes we'll take another one and pull it right through titanium white be right back right back get the least little touch of alizarin crimson don't put a little warmth into that Kenny let's go back up here now then with a white let's put some highlights on these I'm just taking the corner of the brush and just sort of snapping touching it as I come around there and begin working on some basic cloud shapes some basic cloud shapes you need to work on the shapes maybe this old cloud just floats right around up here wherever you want it to go wherever there clouds are very very free so you put them where you want them in your world maybe there's another one right there maybe maybe yep it comes right on down through there it doesn't matter dead matter they're over here well big son of a gun is right out here he comes right up through there this is a good exercise to teach you how to make some beautiful clouds very easy okay no no let me find a good dry two inch brush and I'm gonna just sort of mix this up blend it together where these two colors come together very lightly and I'll continually beat the brush that removes excess paint from the bristles cuz you're gonna pick up a little paint here just blend it together just lambda very lightly very lightly can bring all these together to make some of the most beautiful little effects there if you've never painted a cloud before this one will work for you now a lot of times people like to put all kinds of colors in here you know this according to where you live sometimes there's beautiful beautiful colors in the clouds I lived in Alaska for over a dozen years and we have skies there that are if I painted them you'd think I was nuts I've seen skies and Fairbanks that are brilliant red look like the whole skies on fire hmm and then at night of course you have the Northern Lights that dance and play there's just there's just no limit to what you can do there we go very lightly because we're using a very firm dry paint here you can go over this you can blend it to bring it all together and all I'm doing is beating the brush once again to remove any paint that I've picked up see how you can fluff them and you can make one son of a gun of us guy that easy there okay all right and then let's have some fun okay there it is I'm gonna go right back to my round brush we'll use it for a little bit and I'm gonna take some lizard crimson lizard crimson a little bit of fatal blue we just mix them on the brush here pick up that little bit of white it's laying there looking for sort of a blueish lavender color bluish lavender color and you sort of mix them back and forth to get them like you want okay load the brush up and maybe back here in the distance lives some little foothills all you got to do take them tap downward say it's honors - it may be a little foothill we don't know where it goes wherever you want it there there's some happy little things that live far in the distance you don't see a lot of detail too far away and wherever where you can put a whole row of them in just a second clean dry brush I want to create the illusion of mist down here at the base of these so with the top corner of the brush firmly I'm gonna get in there just tap that sound okay just really raise Kate there then lightly lift upward and that easy then it easy it'll create the illusion of the best okay hey you what let's go back and get my same old brush from crimson and some blue there we are proportionately I'm using much more crimson than blue okay maybe there's a little grassy areas underneath here we just tap in some dark color we just happens in dark so our light will show it's all we're doing there may be two back there okay maybe I use a two-inch price you could continue to use a round brush but both of them in a have it dirty let me put some highlights on there so I'm going to be right into the yellow let me grab a little bit of that lavender blue blueish lavender color when you touch the yellow then you're going to get a beautiful beautiful green loads and paint into this and push give it a little push like it can't smoke here now then maybe back in here there's some nice highlights on this I want this to be very soft very gentle look like the velvet laying Becker pick up blue yellow Oh Colonel indeed yellow here in there very the Conner's a little bit very soft quiet little area this is what they marry is you like to go and just relax and sort of take life easy there we are yeah let's come forward I'll take some black black some pressure the blue lizard crimson I want a dark color here and we just load that around brush up with a lot of color and maybe yeah right here just some happy little bushes that live right here this dark hair you will help push that back and by pushing it back then that will reinforce our illusion of distance and depth in the painting if you Peggle in me before you know I'm sort of a nut for paintings atop that really look deep that we can begin getting getting serious here tell you what maybe yep you're right start getting a little dark sienna there to maybe look at there right out of that brush grows a big tree right over my cloud that's all right you learn how to make a cloud than your times not wasting any time that you learn you gain back their beautiful old tree and all we're looking for here are some basic basic tree shapes there we go so just let that come right on over so you just sort of look at your painting and visualize making decisions should I sort of let it go maybe here we'll put another little tree that lives right there and in your painting you put as many or as few trees as you want you could do just about this entire painting using nothing but the round brush at son-of-a-gun will do unbelievable things I think you could do this entire painting using a round brush there we go over on that side maybe put a tree over here too just like so okay maybe here we go I don't know yeah take big decision so well tall is that tree maybe he lives right along there it's up to you whatever you want in here we're just blocking in color so it doesn't matter how we do it now then we said was going to have some water in here so let's start worrying about reflections this is wet has the liquid light on it so you can grab it and pull see there if you try to do this on a track canvas you're going to be an agony city but because it's wet you can move the paint look at that instant reflections instant reflections used to drive me crazy when our traditional painter and now it's so easy we find I use a liner brush I'll go into some Van Dyck Brown get a lot of paint thinner a lot of paint thinner go right into that Brown I want this to be very very thin and this put let's put indication adjust some tree trunks here and there wherever you think they should be drop them in drop them in there and if you have trouble making your paint flow add some paint thinner because if your paints good and thin then it'll flow right across her there's one don't want this little tree left out give him a little trunk in there gotta have something to hold up all this foliage and there's little sticks and twigs and happy little things that grow back here all the little birds have to have a place to set so they need a little sticks and stuff too there we go yeah then I choose that we use the Oh one-inch brush I'm gonna go right into some of this dark color just to get a little loan two bristles this is the black and the blue then I'm gonna drop down here to the green actually it's yellow but because of what I have on the brush when I touch it automatically it's gonna turn green you have the least least little amount of blue on your brush when you touch down here you've got instant green okay now let's put some foliage on this whole big tree up here there look at that missed all kinds of happy little things as you've heard me say over and over worried about shape and form think about your tree think about the limbs inside there so you can just create the illusion of all kinds of little things that are happening in here there and that's super and it works so well there's no big secrets to painting anybody can paint all you needs a few tools little instruction and the vision in your mind the chances are you already have the vision and we're showing you how to take a few very simple little tools and create all kinds of beautiful things we're going to little-endian yellow little yellow ocher will sparkle this one up a little there now the round brush works very well for this too there we go they bit here and there add a little SAP green to my brush down and here it's a little bit lower shadows are little stronger things down here to be a little darker ooh this is world and creatures live there those squirrels played out in here and come down dig hole had acorns for winter I've still got a little squirrel like I've mentioned some of the other series I still have a little squirrel that lives with me I've raised him ever since he was just a tiny baby there he's a sinner again - well he eats better than those people do every day I fix him up this big gourmet meal he lives in a great big tall cage I built we call it we call the cage squirrel Hilton hmm I sort of spoiled my creatures huh but that's okay pretty soon here he's gonna be turned loose and go back to nature and he'll say well he really had it made he live like a king for a while okay I get off on some crazy subjects here talk too much and let's go back to work let it take some black and some crimson a little Prussian blue and just getting into a bigger brush drop in some little colors here maybe there's a yeah maybe this little pencil it comes out there so it just sort of happens we don't make mistakes we just have half the exigent so when things like this happen use them should tell your friend don't fight them don't fight that's what I like so much about painting this way you don't have any you don't have any tracings on here that you have to follow any lines you have to stay inside it you're only limited here by your imagination and it just like any other muscle in your body your imagination increases proportionately to the amount of practice you give it so practice see things that you mind maybe over here watch here pods here maybe there's one right there but practice practice first any any secret to any style of painting or in my mind to anything that you're ever good at there's any secret to it is just practice that's all I'll take a little bit of Van Dyck Brown put it out very flat get tough with it cut off a little roll of paints right out of the edge of the night maybe right up in here and lives a little bit of land see again thinking about your little pond here this is a little pond or lake or whatever you want it to be take a little dark sienna and wipe get that little roll of paint or put the least little indication here and there some highlights that live on there don't want a great deal go into my liquid white let's put a little a little water line right here just a just a happy little light area sort of separates and breaks it all up light against dark dark against light continually that's what makes your painting stand out let's say we bring up a little bush down here and here and there touch a little touch of there a little touch of the touch a little bit of braid we head there justice but a little sparkler here in there hmm let's get the big brush shoot that one's too slow tap a little more of the yellow into it and just sort of give it a little push a push so there's paint right out of the tip that all you have to do is just touch and lay in all kinds of beautiful soft little grassy areas on there and sort of have these flowing downward it'll it'll give the impression that there's a recessed area here for your water decided waters like me it's lazy or it always looks for the easiest way to do things it won't climb it won't climb a hill just to be pretty for you it's going to look for that low where you're just going to go in there and hide just lay there and be quiet so I always remember that water still water especially is in the recessed area there we go just bearing back and forth between the yellow yellow ochre Indian yellow a little bit of bright red 9 then just sparkling and the more you tap this the softer you'll get it gets so soft just like it's just like green velvet laying out there years ago I used to do a lot of Velveteen paintings it's a nice way to paint nice way to paint there's like watercolors you you only get one chance if you make a mistake on velvet you get a new piece of velvet and you start over again on this you scrape it off do whatever you want to do paint over it that's one of the reasons I like oils so much because here it has to be the most forgiving medium of all a little paint thinner right on the liner brush this one put the indication it turns up the tree trunk in here we don't want this one left out there standing up everybody out there to see there okay have it handed there it is take a little bit of that yellow get a little touch of a bright red right there and just have a little color into it should go right up in here let's just put the indication of some nice foliage out here on this little tree don't forget him there we are nice little things are happening out here very nice there and it really pays if you leave a little dark area between the last bit of bright foliage and the bottom it creates that illusion of shadow underneath maybe maybe there's a nice bush it lives right here put in some basic little color then we'll take a brighter color and sparkly see a little bit of yellow make him just stand right out from the ones in the background hey James there he goes that easy okay back to the old big brush making that color a little bit brighter it stands out looks like his light zinging through there you can go into a little bit of titanium white for example look at there look right here see it gives the impression there's light just a zip until they return don't go too wild with this it'll lose its effectiveness if you put too much on there there's a little touch right in there add it back to my Van Dyck Brown and in here let's just put us in the indication of a little bit of land down in here forever okay just sort of scrub it in maybe over here look at there see there yeah then back to her highlight color that was dark seeing a touch of white and just like crazy just barely touching the high spots gentle touch to caress it that's all there is to it like that and then liquid white going go back in here and just cut in the indication a little waterline just a little light area in between this really helps bring it out like so a little bit over here don't want this side left out take the knife just great breath through the paint here and there put the indication of some sticks and twigs and live in your sticks bushes there that also helps create the illusion of depth and distance in your painting okay I think we have one it's about ready for a signature so I take some rib liner brush then my paint down with paint thinner I'll sign this and right over here in the corner I really hope you've enjoyed this painting will certainly give you a lot of experience that you use the tools and I think you'll enjoy so as you can see we worked with several different planes also I showed you how that round brush should work once again you could paint this entire painting using only the round brush so I think we'll call this one finished and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and god bless you you
