hi hi welcome back I'm certainly glad you could join me today today let's do a happy little winter scene that's something I think you'll like so I'll tell you what let's start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that let me tell you what I've already done I've got the old 18 by 24 pre stretched canvas up here is covered with liquid white and it's ready to go sartet let's get started today thought today I'd start with the old two-inch brush and we'll go into a small amount of the phthalo blue just a little bit just a little bit and I'll be right back go reach over here get a little touch of alizarin crimson very small amount cans go up here let's just do a quick happy little sky today just use a little crisscross strokes just like so and just just dance in a happy to the sky there we go that's phthalo blue the least little touch of alizarin crimson just the smallest smallest amount of crimson don't want much hey well come over here put in something right there there we go as I say thought today we do it a little winter scene they're always very nice came down here we're gonna have a winter scene down the bottom of this people that have a little bit of snow so I'll just use those same colors and let's just lay in a little littles blue with a small amount of crimson in it this'll end up being the shadows in our snow sanely if we were gonna have water down here we might have water what the heck we may change your mind want some water in here there either way whether it ends up being water or it's shadows in the snow it'll be here okay and clean the old brush off and we clean our brushes with odorless thinner shake off the excess okay and just beat the devil out of it there we go I Drive the people in the studio here crazy now I just want to take and blend this a little bit just blend it a little can we just bring all that together now by not covering the entire sky you've got some areas that look like little clouds and you really haven't done a thing there just allow the canvas to work for you and the paint you don't have to work yourself to death to do a beautiful little painting okay today let's have some little mountains in here but let's make them today with will use alizarin crimson and phthalo blue proportionately now we're going to have much more crimson than blue because the blue is many times stronger than the crimson put a little white out here just so I could tell what color ahead maybe I have a little more crimson and you just you just get this to us the right flavor there that's probably pretty good I have it today let's just make some little some little mountains back here with a fan brush this is a very easy way of making just a happy little mountain there just load both sides full of paint I guess Cup here now then decide where you where your first little mountain will be and just using the point or the corner of the fan brush just sort of lay in a basic shape there's very little paint very little pressure on the brush here just enough to get the color to come off don't need much paint and just lay in your basic shape okay maybe maybe oh yeah there we go just let your imagination go and just drop in little just little things wherever you want there okay and then I'm going to take the 2 inch brush and grab that and pull it the liquid whites on the canvas this paint will move it'll slide on the canvas and I wanted to get a lighter and lighter toward the base grab it and pull and the brushstrokes will make the illusion of highlights and shadows here without ever doing a thing just the brush strokes is all you need ok over in here we'll grab this one and pull him there see now the more you blend these naturally the lighter they're going to get them value so you can keep blending these to be just about go away so you have to make big decisions here house how strong do you want these to be here or do you want to just to blend right into nothing you can do anything that you want their kingdom maybe inner world tell you what get a little more paint on the brush here and just load this the same way just back and forth with a fan brush see that's all it takes maybe maybe maybe maybe there's a big mountain that lives I had up here in the foreground and it maybe goes right in the front of these and just wherever you want it to go but this color I'm applying more pressure I want it to be darker as things get closer to you in a landscape they should get darker say maybe that comes right on my parent pushes those Leone back more paint more color on this particular mountain maybe maybe yeah you're right there's another little bump there but immediately this pushes OHS we back into the distance now once again with a large brush grab this and pull it just fine there that's all there is to it this is one of the simplest ways of making a mountain if you've never attempted a mountain before I guarantee you this one will work for you there we go there see when I was a when I was a kid being raised in Florida there used to be a car salesman on the radio every morning that was before the days of television and I can remember they used to say this car has a Georgia guarantee on it and people would call and they'd say what's a Georgia guarantee and I said well it falls into both halves of yours so that's the kind of guarantee we got here only this one will work now maybe you want to go a little further than that I get crazy some time here let's take a tiny little amount of white I just want to show you what can be done if you want to you take a little bit of white paint on the knife and just graze the canvas just here and there all you're doing is just touching and just let it as if just graze it so to do that in a faster it works better if you have time to think about it you'll hesitate and then work as well just just do it fair and put the indication here and there a little bit of highlight but I don't want that to be too bright someone come back and just blend it up with a little bit and just blend it almost away cuz I don't want these mountains to be two distinct these are easy little mountains they're just fine and that's just enough to give it a touch of highlight and give you the indication that maybe there's a little bit of snow okay mmm okay let's wash the old brush here shake off the excess and just beat the devil out of it alright today tell you what let's put some trees back here clean off the spot on my palate even as big as this palette is every once awhile I run out of room because I make such a mess on here let's take we use some dark see Hannah into that I'll add a little touch of yellow ochre but mainly dark Sienna now one of the questions I get quite frequently speaking of palette people say hey my palette looks different than yours yours is not clear it was clear but I take sandpaper and scuff it all up for television use otherwise it shines so bright that it would put great big flares on the screen so it's just like your palette it's absolutely crystal clear clear it's just that I just let scuff it all up just like the brush Burroughs here are taped I put tape on those so they don't shine okay let's go right up here and begin tapping in just the indication of some happy loot restart at the base of the tree so it's a darkest and work upward just tapping to begin working on some shape and some form just tap and we'll just friend goes it will just go all the way across for the month ahead wherever you want but that easy you can make the indication on a lot of distant little trees there this round brushes fantastic there's some more back up in there lighter lighter lighter toward the top down in the bottom here we want them to be dark with shadows wherever you think they should live and then just let them fade upward just sort of disappear if you're into the sky very soft very gentle quiet and then we find milliner brush i'll add a little paint thinner and i'll just use that same color that's all right same old color paint thinner on the liner brush you want to paint to be thin like ink yeah then we just take the liner brushing just here and there put the indication of a few little tree trunks that are showing through and wherever you want to don't worry about getting too many in there it's just here and there forever there and it just adds a lot of detail to you tell your little trees that are back in the distance and most of it will product out a bunch of stuff in here that'll cover most of it of them but someone will show through and it people look at your paintings and they know that you cared enough to take the time to add some of these little details there we go yeah maybe maybe maybe there's some snow there we'll take our big brush just use titanium white right on the big brush it will make a big decision here maybe our snow line lives right about here just grab and give it a pull stay there just make a decision and drop it in soliders to it wherever you want it to be just like so this big brush you can paint a lot of snow very rapid dad and take for a second and this is where you begin worrying about the lay of the land or the way the way the ground flows that becomes very important at this at this stage of the game now then I want to make some evergreen trees we will have some beginning for green trees here so I'm going to take some Prussian blue what has strong black we'll use some Van Dyke Brown throw some crimson in there the one thing that I don't want to use in these trees is green normally if I was doing a summer scene I'd add some SAP green in here but if we put green into this color and it ever gets into your snow hmm the only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow so I don't I don't put any green and winter trees like this because it's a son of a gun if it gets into the snow there we go load the fan brush full we'll use a fan brush to make some nice evergreens maybe in our world there be one who lives right there and start off with just a line now then you corner the brush and work back and forth there as we work naina tree I'm going to sort of turn the brush over this way today so the tree will get wider I wants wider trees there Saint bring him right down into the snow there and it would go back up here and I'll reload the brush same way just to fill it full of paint okay now that maybe there's another happy tree lives right about there and sort of look at your painting it may be different they may not want to tree there you decide in your world or paintings where trees live in your paintings there we go wherever you want to match the right place from the beam and camus give him a friend maybe he's got a friend yep you're right right there you know me I think everything should have a friend theme if it's just a tree through painting I haven't got so many fantastic friends it may be the best part of this whole thing it's a super way to express yourself and it brings people together there we go maybe isn't that a little tree yep you're right again right there there he is it doesn't matter if your tree has a limb that maybe this one didn't it's not the exact same distance out of the other one because trees grow anyway that make them happy in fact if your tree gets to where it looks too symmetrical then it's sort of boring trees have personalities who they like people there's some big ones and some small ones and each each one is an individual let them be that way don't fight it now then don't take the large brush and go up underneath this tree and intentionally here bring the camera right up here let's look I'm intentionally I want to pick up some of this blue and let it move and that's going to create the illusion of a shadow underneath these trees see there see grab that color and just let it pull right on down there you go and then fantastic see let's go over to this one here same thing grab it and pull it creates a little shadow eye underneath the tree there we go now by creating these shadows look at the planes that are in this painting see all these different levels that's what creates depth in your painting and as you know if you're out here selling paintings that's what sells you painting let's have another tree there's so much fun do this in stages or in layers do the thing is farthest away first and then come forward to continually come forward in your painting I say I want to I want this tree to be in front of all that so you do that back here and then you put a tree big tree right there I can and we will make him exactly the same way and you can make these trees with a one or two inch brush also a two inch brush would make some super trees I use it a great deal now this tree lives in front of that one so we'll just right over the top it's all right it does not matter and he lives down here there he is and then we'll grab our brush with a white doughnut once again and pull a shadow out from this tree throw him left out didn't it fantastic that that easy you have all those little evergreen sitting right up there and snow underneath them really works nice let me grab another fan brush here I will dip this fan brush into a small amount of the liquid white into titanium white and at least little touch of phthalo blue the liquid white is in there to make the paint thinner okay now with a thinner paint as you know but then paint will stick to a thick paint we can go back in here and we can come right down here and begin adding some highlights or a little bit of snow on these trees not looking for a great deal because I don't want to lose this dark contrast that's very important to me I like this contrast in this particular painting I'm afraid if I lose it then it'll just sort of blend together stay low blue white and a little bit of liquid white just and then the paint sort of stick they're fantastic absolutely fantastic you could do it there we go anything that you want to do all you have to do is believe you can do it if you believe you can do it then you can died can do anything if you believe strong enough there that's super every day every day I get letters of people who tell me that's true they never believed they paint as long as they live in their painting beautiful beautiful paintings and it's surprising how many people tell me that they're out selling their paintings and selling is not important the money is not important what's important is that somebody cares enough about what you did to give you they're harder and happy buck and it does good things in here what it does in the wallet it means nothing what it doesn't here though you sell one painting and you immediately run home and you'll paint 25 more paintings and it forces you to practice I talk too much maybe there's a little cabin here let's put a little cabin I like those maybe when the easiest ways to paint a cabin is to take and scrape out a basic shape just use the knife and scrape out a general shape little bit let blue ganor and you can see it and you can scrape out the entire cabin without being committed see this just any way you want to now then let's take some van Dyck Brown we'll do this back back here there just drop it right in I'll I have that on there so we'll go ahead and put it in the front boys your waste houses were this easy to build some are good my father was a carpenter contractor did carpenter work I spent half my life learning how to how to work with wood there we go and I can tell you that houses aren't this easy to build for real okay now I want a nice straight edge back here so just take a little bite and lay in your basic line there and then when you come down you have a beautiful straight line without any problem that's sneaky huh there we go okay now other side of this little house would have some snow laying over there drop that in okay who use it color we made the tree out of that was a nice color I'm gonna add some more yellow ochre to it so it's dark sienna yellow ochre a little CAD yellow into it too what the heck don't overmix leave it sort of marbled and cut off a little roll of paint I will go back up here and maybe just touch and give a little side where it's pull just give it a little pull there their touch give a little pull ahead a little titanium wire brighten that up so it shows a little bitter in your world you make it any way you want it there we go we'll just look like old boards down the side over here I'm gonna had a lot of Van Dyck Brown of that goes over here it should be much darker not as much lights going to strike now we can do a cabin ectomy decide where you want this cabin to live just take your knife cut it off this is the way you clean up your cabin work on your perspective get everything together grab the little knife a little touch of brand we put a window right there OOP that easy hope you can see that there's a little window there I take what maybe over here there's a little shed will disk ratch out a little area for the top come back in here a little snow out there I can't come right back to some Brown yeah we can just lay in the front of the shed there's a side take a little bit of our color lay and a few little happy boards here this just a tiny shed it will cut it off here in just a second see there now decide where you want it and do so surly you just do a cabin ectomy and let's put a door right there it's that easy yeah we have a little door take a little paint go around the door so it stands out we're in business now then grab a fan brush well you can take the fan brush here add a loop titanium white on it and just begin putting some snow around the base here little blue white there okay we got us a happy little cabin and easy and maybe tell you what maybe there's a little bit of water here let's go right into a touch the phthalo blue just a touch grab a little that color we made a tree out of doing too much paint if there's water here all you do grab this pull straight down look at that just pull straight down decide where the water is living pull down maybe it goes right on back here wait on the hoard goes straight down and then go across I guess so like so then take a little touch of brown maybe there's some nice stones and here that live a couple little stones and take some snow and bring right up over the top there little bit of liquid white on that pallet now and let's go back in here and just cut in the indication of a happy little water lines alright so okay and it goes this thing goes right on the back this little body of water let's get crazy shoot have some fun I'm going back into my dark sienna and yellow ocher mixture with a round brush let's have us a nice treat this right here dark see and a little band I can Brown here in it we just live right here goes right on up there put in a basic shake that's all we're looking for right now it's just a very basic shake there okay now now we'll cut him off right here put a little snowbank there and we can turn that right into a reflection into the water get a little bit of that white pull it straight down and the tree color okay touch of the yellow ocher least little touch a bright red and you can begin defining some of these little limbs and branches here and there just like so all you're using is a top portion for the bristles to create individual little things don't put too much color here this is supposed to be old and then just sort of hanging around out here we can take a fan brush and a little bit of yellow ochre and stuff all those little colors there we go put some little things growing down in here okay a little stick or two and we're to the point we have a nice happy completed little painting I think we'll call that one finished and from all of us here happy painting and God bless you you
