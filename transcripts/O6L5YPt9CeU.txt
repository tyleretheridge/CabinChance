hello I'm Bob Rios and I'd like to welcome you to this our ninth joy of painting series this is your first time with us I hope you dragged off your paint some big easel and you come and paint with us if you've been with us before welcome back I'm certainly certainly glad to see you again so I tell you what let's haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and they'll come across and exactly the same orders I have them on the palette starting with a titanium white and working around while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started let me tell you what's happened already I have an 18 by 24 inch canvas up here and we've already covered it with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white the liquid white makes the canvas wet makes it slick it allows us to actually blend color right here on the canvas instead of working yourself to death on the palette so let's get started I would do a happy little painting I thought today tell you what let's do a beautiful little winter scene has a lot of warm colors in it thank you think you're going to like it I'm going to take off today with a little bit of yellow ochre a little yellow ochre and into that a touch of bright red and all you need is just a small amount of the ribs very very strong very strong okay let me clean my knife let's use we'll use a two inch brush and we'll go right into this and just tap it very gently tap it just get a little color on here let's go right back up here maybe we'll have a happy little Sun in this painting so decide basically where you want the Sun to be and I'm going to have mine right up here it will start off it would just make some some crisscross strokes just like so just sort of blend it out do that like that yeah little crisscross strokes like so there you go now maybe I had just the smallest amount of red I want it to be a little bit brighter out here on the edges we want this to be a a very warm little winter scene happy little scene sometimes winter scenes oh they could become so cold and comfortable to look at so with a little warmth in this one just like that okay I'm going to wash the brush now we wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner and I really recommend you use odorless thinner you're going to be working by yourself shake the brush off hmm that's the fun part of this technique all right I'm gonna go right into some they low blue we'll just tap the old two-inch brush right in there reach out over here and grab a little bit of the midnight black so we have black and blue just mix them together on the brush let's go right back up here now start from the outside cuz I want it to be darker out here than it is up close to where the sun's gonna be and we're still using little crisscross strokes and just begin working that right up to the color there mm that's a pretty little sky already a little more color just flew in like little impact bring it right on the round so we have sort of a vignette now we have that color in the brush I'm gonna have one has some snow down here and in the snow we want some shadows so while we have this blue and black I'm just gonna come right across here just lay in a little touch of color but already we have a painting ready for the Museum of Modern Art there we are we can stop there okay I'm gonna get a clean dry to enterprise I have several of them here so I don't have to wash them all the time and right here with these two colors come together I want to blend this so it's very soft very gentle there we go be brave just get in here and do it see just blend those edges right out so you can't tell where one color stops and the next one starts just like so and then blend outward as your brush gets dirty then go into the darker colors you don't want to take a dirty brush and go into your light colors or you'll be you'll paint instant mud mixer and you'll be mad at me anything should make you happy we stress that over and over it really should make you happy should make you feel good fair no I'll wash this brush shake off the excess thinner mm-hmm and just beat the devil out of it okay we said there was going to be a Sun in here so let's use a finger rule finger paint today I'm just gonna tap the old finger right on there okay let's go up here decide where your son's gonna be and just very firmly very firmly rub that right in there okay and you can do this several times to get any degree of lightness that you want there nice bright little Sun now then if you try just blending that chances are with smear on you so take your knife and very gently just go so had to make a little noise or it doesn't work now you can blend that the value remains in the canvas there we go and we got a happy little Sun I'll tell you what maybe maybe there's a little cloud that sort of floating across there I'll take a little black and little blue on the fan brush we'll use the old fan brush you don't want much color on there just a little okay let's go back up here now maybe this little cloud he lives right up here he just sort of just sort of floats around in the sky comes right across the Sun there there he comes there he is there he is and this is your little cloud so wherever you wanting that's where you should be wherever clouds are one of the freest things in nature they just sort of float around the sky and have a good time there we go now with a clean dry brush and this is three hairs and some air very lightly very lightly just blend this together in that fantastic and that easy you have a very nice warm little sky all right I know I lived in Alaska for over a dozen years and I'm sort of partial to mountain so I I think will put a happy little mountain in here if were you live maybe you don't have mountains and you don't want a mountain in your painting you can certainly leave it out that's no problem at all okay I'm taking some dark sienna and a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown and just mix them together Kate no pull it out very flat very flat and cut across it so you have that little roll of paint on the knife it's most important this knife has a straight edge so it's very easy to load okay let's go right up here now decide where you want the mountain to be maybe we'll have a happy little mountain that lives right there and our mountains are happy we have happy little mountains there we go and I'm really really pushing this color into the canvas try to push it right through the fabric it get tough with it take a strong pill this part of the mountain goes on very firm and all we're looking for is this nice top edge up here we could care less what's happening in here all we're looking for is a nice edge okay there we go that gives us a basic shape to work with and we just take a 2 inch brush grab this and pull it just pull it see this canvas is wet has the liquid white on it so you can move color hmm and when you're painting mountains you've painted with me before you certainly heard me say this over and over if you can see the entire mountain the top of the mountain is always more distinct than the bottom of the mountain so by pulling it down allowing you to mix with the liquid white that happens automatically and now the lazy painter I look for the easy way to do things okay let's have some fun now let's go three would take a little bit of this blue black and to that I'm going to add a touch of white touch it white okay that'll be our shadow color and then we'll just use we'll just use some titanium white here we'll put a little bit of snow out on the mountain cut across and get that small roll of paint on the knife again very important let's go right up here all right let's just have a little light plane right through there now this this is the most delicate touch imaginable pretend your whisper floating through here it's very gentle very light caress the canvas it's so gentle I get so many letters from painters all over the countries and my snow doesn't want to break and by break I mean it has all those little holes in it 99 times out of a hundred the problem is that you're applying too much pressure or you're using a paint that's too soft or combination of both the paint we use here is extremely firm and there's no pressure no pressure at all at this at this stage when you're putting the base coat of the mountain on you you're really strong really push it in but here you just let it caress now a little bit of a shadow color just here and there but notice the angles this is going to opposing her opposite angles this is one of the simplest type of little mountains to make it's very easy and it works work so we'll say here how maybe we want to bring those together and you can do it can do it that easy ahead easy just make all kinds of happy little things little ridges and if you're a skier you know you want to put all those little places in so you can go and ski okay that gives us a happy little mountain now we want to create some mist at the bottom of this mountain so with a clean dry two inch brush I'm going to begin tapping being very careful to follow the angles that are in that mountain very careful over here we'll go in this direction and lift upward still following those angles that's most important you can destroy your mountain here by changing the angles I don't want to do that like a tap that easy we got a happy little mountain okay we will have a little footie hill back here and for that I'm gonna take some black a little touch of blue little touch of blue and some white so we have black blue and white maybe a little bit more of the white I would lighten that up a little bit now like Cappin good okay we clean the knife off and we'll grab we grab a fan brush we'll do it with a fan brush today loaded full just really load a lot of color in there it's black blue blue and titanium white okay just go back up here decide where your little foothills live here and just sort of touch and begin just painting in some happy little shapes you have to sort of make big decisions this is your world on this piece of canvas and when you create your own world you have to make those decisions where does these little footy Hills live they got bumps on they go up down where are they where are they painting gives you tremendous amounts of power on this canvas and you have to use it make decisions okay okay I want to create some mist at the bottom of these so with a clean dry two inch brush tap just tap like so it creates the illusion of mist and then come back and lift upward very short little strokes and it'll make it look like little trees we back in the distance far far away no I'm gonna take that same color and we're going to add a touch of alizarin crimson to it load the brush the same way just going to add a little crimson so it has a slight purplish you can just go back up here maybe yep yeah we're going to have another little row of foothills there and you can put these on with a one-inch brush or two inch brush whatever whatever and just have a dirty fan brush I thought I'd use it pull it down once again want to create that illusion of mist so for the two-inch brush all we're doing is just happy just taffy gently gently lift it upward and then sometimes you'd like to play some games and maybe make it look like there's a little light playing through here so I'll take just a little white on the brush and just barely touch right here just maybe there's a little light playing through here I can't just a little bit don't overdo don't overdo it so easy to overkill here and then very lightly we'll just tap all that so it's pretty soft say it makes it look like is a little bit of happy little sunshine playing through there on this last cool bit there we go okay yeah maybe back in here there's some snow let's have some fun we are going to the titanium white use the old fan brush touch if they look blue into that titanium white and phthalo blue they don't lose a beautiful blue color it's bright blue right up in here now that here's where you begin determining the lay of the land if you got little hills and valleys this is where you do it okay let's go right in here and touch and make a happy little hill right there that easy stand easy see there we got a little hill maybe there's another hill lives right here I just added a little more white and that easy daddies you can create all kinds of little hills and valleys pay particular attention to the lay of the land oh look at that just hill after hill this is where I'd ski right down here I'll leave this up here for the experts I'll fall down a lot get three left feet there we go all right now well we need a we need a tree I'm gonna make a let's make a happy little evergreen here I'm gonna take some black so monic some Prussian blue Russian Blue is very strong to be careful with it so we have black pression blue put some Van Dyke Brown in there shoot we'll even throw some alizarin crimson in you're just looking for a very dark color there okay let me clean off of it all right you know just use the old fan brush loaded full of color a lot of color okay let's go right up here now you got to make some decisions where does your trees live I think there's a tree there is now yes right here and use just the corner of the fan brush work it back and forth I had a lady in class one time and she called these Z trees maybe that's a good analogy just think of making Z's well you're just like Xaro in here just look at that those trees live right in this brush oh you have to do a sort of scare amount shake them a little bit like so like so back and forth and you put as many or as few trees in your world as you want now sometimes it's fun to play some games here I'm gonna go to another fan brush and back to that lavender color a head back to the lavender color okay let's go right up in here maybe there's some trees that live far away and as things get closer to you in the landscape they get darker and value so back here if you want to make the indication of trees that live way back just use a lighter color see maybe he's got a happy little friend there's right there so you put as many trees or as few in your world as you want it's up to you just want to show you how to make a tree and do decide how many trees live in your world okay maybe let's do it over here too I want some trees on this side I have this lavender looking color going you just drop an indication of happy little tree there and there there we go alright now we go back to our brush it has a dark color and yep yep yep I'm gonna put a tree at this old tree when he was just a little baby maybe a big deer came by and stepped on him in mmm hurt him a little bit so he sort of depth I think I think personally landscapes look better if all the trees aren't perfectly straight it's terrible to think that every tree is just a future telephone pole put some shape in your trees let them let them bend and oh and just just have fun there we go there we go right on down now this could be done with a 2 inch brush or 1 inch brush works very nicely also no problem okay maybe we'll put another happy little tree right there I like to do these evergreen trees my home in Alaska there was a lot of evergreens I had one in my front yard it gosh it must have been 60 or 70 feet tall and a ptarmigan used to set up their ptarmigans a beautiful bird in the winter time he turns white and he's so pretty so pretty I think he's in the grouse family beautiful bird Laska is only place I've ever seen him but I'm sure there other places there nothing that pretty could be just in one place there we go good dark color we're looking for contrast here let's put one right here - what - heck what this will give you a lot of practice making some happy - lever greens earlier and down in here you could care less you separate these but highlights we're gonna come back and highlight this up so right now all we're looking for is color just want the color here that's all alright man we need some trunks and there to hold up these little tree so I'll use some of the dark Sienna a little bit of white okay cut us off a tiny little roll of paint let's go back up here and we'll come right up through here and just touch here and there you're not gonna see the entire trunk you're just gonna see parts of it so don't worry about it don't worry about it just enjoy okay and sometimes you can see the indication of little trunks that are here back in there like that things go on the other side over here we don't want these little trees to be left out they get upset if you don't don't give them a trunk too don't his feelings hurt these are happy little trees they can take just the point of the knife and scratch in a few little dead limbs evergreens always have dead limbs on ok I'm going into some liquid white because I'm looking for a paint us a little thinner titanium white a little bit of a little blue okay now then let's put some highlight here is your light source so over here the left side of the tree is going to be brighter than the right side just drop in some highlights like so darker darker dark as it goes down now this is a thinner paint so it sticks on top of here without any problem if your paint won't stick might get a little bit thinner and then you'll find it works better one of our golden rules if this is your first time with us is that a thin paint will stick to a thick paint so we start off with a thickest paint we can find and then each layer gets thinner and that's what makes all this work there's no big secret to it there we go just indication of a few little highlights here and there Parker darken up there it is and it's gets down in here more shadows darker darker darker okay steel pan brush mad right into some white a little bit of the blue and let's start right in here and we'll put another happy little Hill allowed to pick up some of this dark color and that's become shadows so they're that easy creature shadows all at once okay now maybe there's some little grassy things that go right in there there they are you can just push them in like so okay Nana then no then over here let's go right over in this side here's another little plane so each one of these little Hills you make creates a different plane in your painting and helps it really helps create the illusion of depth distance there we go and once again let it pickups on this dark color you pull it down like that follow the lay of the land so very important at this time very important flute can you add a little touch of the liquid white matte thinner paint once again see I can pull that up and make all kinds of happy little things happen here I'm just pushing upward give it a little upward pull just make all kinds of pretty things hmm I like these little winter scenes now I'm just sort of working back and forth with it with the blues and the whites tell you what if you painted with me before you know I'm a water fanatic so let's have some water in this I like water so I'm just going to tap the brush into tiny bit of the phthalo blue little black things go right back up here make a decision water lives right here there it is there it is that easy bad easy just pull it down straight down you sure these lines come straight down and then very lightly go across and that will create the illusion of water that easy we will take it right on off the end of the campus there you go that's just a happy little pond that lives out there one will take a little bit of this dark color maybe there's a stone right here so we'll put the stone on see their lives a little stone right there he's got a little friend named Harold this is Harold a stone right here will reflect a little bit of that down in here take our 2 inch brush pull that down come across yeah then our fan burst it has the the white on it and as I say I have several of each brush going here so I don't have to wash them between each time yeah let's put a little bit of snow right up on that rock it's that easy I can just a little bit there now we'll take some liquid white on the knife pull it out very flat cut across it we just put a little waterline little bit of snow laying right here just like so there another nice little little snow scene and it's easy you can do it a little slow lane right up through there I think we have a painting it's ready for a signature I'm gonna dip the brush right into a little bit of the liquid clear bring it to a nice sharp point let's sign it right here I hope you've enjoyed this painting it's a lot of fun and I look forward to seeing you again next time so for all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless Oh
