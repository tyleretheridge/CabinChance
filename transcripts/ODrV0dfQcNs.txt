- Welcome back, I'm certainly
glad you could join us. I was standing here talking
to my little friend, Mr. Jay. He's a little Blue Jay,
just a little baby, and I wanted to show him to you today. Today's a very special
day, this is the last show of the 29th Joy of Painting series, so I thought Mr. Jay outta come out here and get to meet everybody,
turn around, say "Hello." Say, "Hi, hi." He's a
little tiny Blue Jay, just a few weeks old, yeah, yes he is. Isn't he something though? He's just as cute as he can be. Alright, you ready to go over here and play for a little bit, huh? I gotta go to work. Alright, I'ma set him right over here. While I'm setting him over here, let's run the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got done up here. Have my standard old canvas up here today, but today I've done something
just a little different. Actually, I've taken black and painted a little line here on each side. Then I've covered that
line with masking tape. Now, on each side, I've put
liquid clear on each side. And, in the middle here, I've just covered that with liquid white. You remember? I think it
was in the last series we did a little painting
that had wood grain in it and it was just beautiful,
everybody liked it, and I've got hundreds of letters about it wanting to see more. So let's do something like that. I'm gonna take a little Sap Green, a little Alizarin Crimson,
and about equal parts, and mix them together, it'll
make a nice brown color. And as I said, about equal parts, you can take it to the
red side, the green side, or just make a very nice
chocolate brown with it. It's up to you. There, that's good enough. Now then, let's take our two-inch brush and put a little color on it. And I'm just going to paint this. Literally just paint it, just like you were painting the barn. There, just using that
beautiful brown color we made. You can make it lighter, darker, you can do it in any color that you want. The transparent colors seem
to work a little better. But, basically, any color that you want. Something like that. Let's do the same basic
thing on the other side. We'll just paint it. These are very pretty, done
in a blue-grey color too. Beautiful, I really like
it in that blue-grey. Try it, you'll be amazed at how easy it is to make a wood grain
effect, and how effective. As I said, we did this in the last series, and I didn't realize how
popular it was gonna be. We've just been bombarded with letters wanting to see more of that. And that's really all there is to it. And we wash the brush. Well, almost all there is to it. That's all there is to
putting the color on. Beat the brush out good and dry. Now then, let's take
an old fan brush here. Take the fan brush and I'm gonna dip it into paint thinner and just
loosely shake off the excess. And with that, I'm just gonna take and touch, wiggle, and just
let it slide down here. Paint thinner and liquid
clear have a violent reaction. A violent reaction,
and all these beautiful wood grain effects can happen that easy. Now you can take your time, and you can really put some
gorgeous things in there. We're just doing a quicky. And you can do it just like that. Whatever you want it to be. Now this will continue to
work for a few minutes, so as the painting progresses you're gonna see this change a little bit. Alright, over on this side. There, and you don't have to make all your wood grains just straight. They can be in every which angle. 'Cause look at wood, the patterns in wood are not always just perfect. That's what makes it so beautiful, and different woods have
different grain patterns. As I say, that will continue to work probably throughout the show. Now then, let's just let that continue. As I say, as the paint thinner
and the liquid clear mix, and they work together, all these things will continue to happen. While that's going on, let's just do a quick little painting here. Doesn't matter, we'll just
do something nice and simple that you can do without any problem. Take a little Phthalo
Blue, it's a pretty color. And let's go right up in here, using little criss-cross strokes. Now I don't want the blue to get over into my wood-looking area. I wanna keep it on this
side of the masking tape. We'll just quickly drop in a little sky. That easy, no big deal. As I say, this is the last
show of the 29th series, and it's always sort of a sad time for me when the last show rolls around. There are 29 series of
The Joy of Painting. Each series has 13 shows, must be nearly-- My math's not too good today. Probably 375 shows or so, and if you haven't gotten a
chance to see all of them, give your station a call. We'll get 'em to them one way
or another if they need 'em. I think we'll just do
a mountain scene today. Something very simple and easy. What I really wanna show is the
effect that this side makes. And you can do this with anything. It's gorgeous to do old
driftwood looking stuff and then paint a little seascape in it. Try that, we should have done that. I didn't think about it until just now. There, alright, let's wash the old brush. I just like to wash the brush. (chuckles) Just beat the devil out of it. Alright, happy little cloud. We'll just tap in a little Titanium White. Just using the corner of the brush. Decide where the little
cloud lives in your world. Doesn't matter, clouds are so free, they just sorta float
around, have a good time. Just sort of pick out a little area. I don't want real distinct clouds. Just want some little
basic shapes, wherever. Up to you, you decide. When you have this much power, you have to make decisions in your world. I'm gonna grab a little blender
brush, just very lightly. This little blender brush
is, as my father used to say, "It's tender as a mother's love." And I certainly know, in
my case, that was true. See, just some little floaters
that live up there in the sky have a good time, they
just take life easy. Let's take Midnight Black, Prussian Blue, Alizarin Crimson, Van Dyke
Brown, doesn't matter. Sounds like a good color combination. Pull it out very flat, cut across, get our little roll of paint. I tell you what, I change my mind. See, it's my world, I can do that. Maybe we'll have a mountain
that lives far away. I'm adding some white to that same color. There, little roll. Let's just play, while we're waiting for this wood grain effect over
here to work, we can play. We'll have some good time. We'll just put a little indication of a far away mountain first,
that'll help create that illusion of depth and distance in the painting. Something about like that,
far away little devil. Quiet, very, very quiet. Now, let's go back to
that dark color we had. And maybe in our world right here, lives a big, huge, strong mountain. Giant of a mountain. Something like that. Little ol' peak right
there, wherever you want it. You just make the decision, drop it in. Go back to our two-inch brush,
grab it firmly and pull it, give it a little pull
right up to the edge there. What I wanna do is remove
excess paint and blend it out. So that automatically it looks lighter toward the bottom and does the top. See, that easy. Down to about like that, doesn't matter. Let's take Titanium White, and we'll put the least little
touch of bright red in it. Just enough to sort of warm it. I don't want it to be noticeable even. But it will warm it, little roll of paint. And we can go right up in here, touch, no pressure, no pressure,
no pressure, and let it go. Something about like that. Absolutely no pressure. I hear my little bird on the
other side of the studio, he thinks it's dinner time. Soon as we finish this
I'll have to feed him. He did so well. Little rascals, you have
to feed them seems like about every 20 minutes. There's a fabulous lady
that lives close to me in Orlando, Florida, named Ann Young, and Ann raises and releases,
by herself basically, almost 2,000 song birds every single year. I have no idea how this
woman is able to do that. It's one of the most unbelievable
feats I have ever seen. But she does. Tell you what, let's take a little white, a little bit of-- we'll
use Phthalo Blue today. It's a wonderful day here, and I hope it is wherever your'e at. Phthalo Blue is such a happy color. Once again, our little roll of paint. And with that, no pressure, once again. See, put that one in first, and then we can make decisions. Watch, watch, watch, here he
goes, gonna push him back. Immediately, we pushed
him into the background. In our world, we can
push mountains around. I wanna change this very straight
angle, and we can do that. See there, we can just go right back. Just drop in a little projection that lives right here on the
side of this mountain. Wherever you think it should be, but the secret to it is, it needs to have it's own shadow or it won't play. Needs it's own private
shadow, see how it popped out when we put that shadow,
that has to be there. Each highlight needs it's own
shadow or it just won't work. Maybe over in here, just a wee little bit. And anywhere you want
to create a projection that projects up from the mountain, all you need to do is put
a shadow under, that easy. You really do have unlimited power here. Good, clean, dry, two-inch brush. Follow the angles that you
painted in your mountain. Tap the base of it, and
then pull gently upward. That removes the tap marks,
blends everything together, creates mist at the base. Over here we follow these angles. Something about like so. Wanna get a little
crazier? Okay, let's do it. Let's take some of that dark color and let's put another little mountain that lives right down here at the base. This will create a whole
different plane in your painting, and it just helps improve
that illusion of depth in it. Which, if you've painted
with me through this series, and through many more, you know depth is very important to me in painting. I work very hard to create paintings that have a lot of depth in them. And that's what makes you happy, is when you do paintings that you can see clean oft forever in. There, there're no limits in it. I'ma take some of that
same white I was using. Come right back in here,
and just very quickly throw in some highlights on this mountain. See how you can just
put layer after layer, you can do the whole canvas this way, and it's a wonderful,
wonderful way to practice. Don't be afraid to practice. Nothings free, and the
price you pay for painting or, I believe, anything else
you do well, is just practice. Wherever, we can just put all kinds of little dooders in there, that easy. Back to our almost clean
(chuckles), dry, two-inch brush. I'm gonna tap in just a touch, lift, blend, bring it together. We have three ranges now of mountains. That three, I've decided
not to put in that one. It just makes a whole different plane and it makes your painting deeper. I know nobody's interested
in that happy buck, but if you're out selling paintings, it's these kind of little things, the depth in your painting, that will cause your painting to sell before anybody elses does. I'm gonna take some black, Prussian Blue, Sap Green, and a little Van Dyke Brown. And just throw them all together here. So I'ma make a very dark color
that basically looks black. But there's a lot happening in it, and you don't have to over mix the color. Just throw it on there, and off we go. See? Both sides, full of color. Let's have, right there,
a little evergreen tree. Just a happy little tree,
use the corner of the brush. Work back and forth, forth and back. Back and forth, there you go. See there? Something like so. Tell you what, I think I wanna put some little background things in there. I should have done that
beforehand, and I didn't. I wanna put a little footie
hill that lives right there. Just wanna cover up the
base of that mountain, but that's all you gotta
do is just drop it in. We'll lift upward, make it look
like a little distant trees. Take a little bit of color, pull down, make us a reflection back here. See, I changed my mind again. This has been a wonderful
painting for changing your mind. I'ma take a little liquid white. And just put in just a little water line. Something about like that,
wherever you want 'em. I really should have done that
before I put that tree in. But I just decided this
is where it should be. When you're painting like
this, you can change your mind. It's legal, it's authorized, 'cause you can do anything in your world. And, as you know, we
don't make any mistakes. Now, you'd never even know
which went in first or last. It's that simple, that simple. Some of the earlier series,
I had my son, Steven, at times my good friend,
Dana Jester, with me, and we showed you how to correct errors. Maybe in the next series
we'll show that again. We'll come out with some shows that go into correcting mistakes. If you'd like to see a show
like that, let me know. Tell me what you want. Shoot, if I can't do it or don't know how, which is very possible, we'll
find somebody that does. I've had guest artists that
do just about everything. Alright, let's reflect that
right down in the water. Wherever you want them. See, all we need here is
just a very basic shape. We don't care, I'm gonna pull it down with the big brush, put it all together. Alright, let's grab a big brush. Touch, pull straight down. It's important that it goes straight down. Go across. Instant reflections. While we've got that color on the brush, I'm gonna put a little paint thinner, 'cause I'm gonna go right over
that big mountain I think. Little paint thinner, here we go. Comes a big, strong tree. There, something about like that. Put a little paint thinner if you know you're gonna go over a lot of paint, 'cause the thin paint will
stick to the thick paint. And that way you can go
right over the top of it. Okay, we'll just go on
down here, doesn't matter. Maybe another one right there. Right along in there. However many trees you want in your world, you just drop them in wherever
you think they should be. Let's get a big brush,
we take a two-inch brush, pull it right through
the color, like that. See? Load a lot of paint in there. See, one direction. Touch and push, and some little
bushes live right here, OK? We're not too concerned, just whatever. Something about like that. We'll take a little white,
little bit of Dark Sienna. Mix 'em together, didn't
work, got into the blue. Start over again (chuckles). That's white, little bit of Dark Sienna, mix 'em together, put the indication here and there of some little tree trunks. Wherever, doesn't matter. Just some indications. We'll take our fan brush that
had the dark color on it, and we'll go right through some yellow, because it had blue and black in it. When we hit that, it'll turn green. With that, we'll come right up in here, and just highlight some, not too much. Don't kill it all. 'Cause it'll go away and leave ya. There, something about like that. This big one here, we need some stuff. Some green stuff, there we go. Darker, darker, darker,
down toward the base. I'm gonna grab a one-inch brush. Dip it into a little bit of paint thinner. We'll go into some Sap Green
and right through the yellow. All the yellows, one
direction, load a lot of paint. Create a curve, it goes to the top. With that, we'll go right up in here, and we'll begin picking out
little individual bushes. They live all over our world,
some are tall, some are short. Wherever you think they should be, that's where they should be. We'll just drop a little
reflection down here in the water. Doesn't have to be perfect 'cause we're gonna smoosh it up,
as Steve says, smoosh it. Gonna smoosh it up a little bit. Take a clean brush, touch, very
lightly go down, and across. We have instant reflections. You know while I'm finishing
this painting up here, I really and truly would like to thank you for allowing us into your homes for these painting shows,
it's very special to me. You've made an old man's dream come true, to be able to share his art with literally millions of
people, from coast to coast, and I think that's what
every artist craves the most is for his work to be seen and accepted. I appreciate it form the
very bottom of my heart. I'm just putting little
layers of bushes in here. This is a simple painting,
but if you've painted with me before you can
probably do very easily. Just wanna throw something in real quick. Put a very little sticks and twigs. I need a little brown. Let's put a little soil right in there. (chuckles) I still hear my
little Blue Jay over there. He thought I was gonna feed him when I let him out of his
cage, and he's angry now. He wants to be fed immediately. Little bit of a liquid white. I really do hope you enjoy
seeing all the little animals, 'cause I've mentioned
before, they play a very, very important part in my
life, and I like to share. I still have Midnight the Crow, the little Crow that was shot, that can never be turned loose. He can't fly, his wings all messed up. We take care of him at night,
and he'll be with us forever. Okay, let's pull the tape off, see? Something about like that. And just use a black line
to sort of divide that. Now, if you take this painting, and around the borders you just take a piece of flat, black wood, and nail it on. I think if you go to the lumber
yard, you ask for lattice. It will just make a gorgeous painting. Let's sign this little
rascal, call it done. Once again, I'd like to
thank you for being with us for this entire painting series. From myself, my partners,
Walter, Annette Kowalski, and the entire staff here
at the television station. We would like to thank you for joining us and for supporting The Joy of Painting. From all of us here, we'd like
to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (happy, mellow music)
