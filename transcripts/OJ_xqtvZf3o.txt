hi glad to see you again today you ready to a fantastic seascape I thought that's what we'd do today so let's start out and have run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this seascape with me and that's going up here let me talk just a little bit while they're doing that I started with a good old standard 18 by 24 inch canvas but I've done something a little bit different today the top part of the canvas is totally covered with a thin even coat of liquid white all the way up here down you can see this little line here now from here down is covered with liquid clear now this is just like liquid white only it's clear that's all so let's go and do a fantastic little seascape I'm gonna start out with a 2 inch brush and a small small amount of the CAD yellow very small amount just beat it into the bristles a little bit can't go up here now then maybe we'll have a beautiful bright little sky today so I'm just gonna start with a little yellow do something like so just let that mix with the liquid white there now without cleaning the brush go right in to a touch of yellow ocher load the brush the same way go back up here now right around the edges of that see there still use the little crisscross strokes we'll just bring that right around sort of like so there we go and if a little happens to get down here in your painting don't worry about it don't worry about it it's no problem at all okay still without cleaning the brush will go right into bright red a little bit some very strong okay now that right around those edges take a little bit of this beautiful red color just like so not pretty already we have a we have a painting for the Museum of Modern Art here you can just stop right there now that I want to put a little bit of red over here and just let it work right along right in here is gonna be the horizon there we go and we just very lightly blend all this together okay now then I have several brushes go in son I'd spend all my time washing I'm gonna take straight titanium white just straight white and go right up in this area and I want this to be very bright too so I'm gonna take white and put it right there straight titanium point now it won't show up much because light against light is nothing but you just wait I'm gonna grab it and pull it just pull grab it and pull we don't care what happens in here we're gonna cover all that effort we now then let me wash it a brush and we just wash our brushes with odorless paint thinner shake them off and beat the devil out of them okay we can just use this same old brush I'm gonna go into a small amount of phthalo blue and reach up here and grab a little touch of alizarin crimson so we have phthalo blue and alizarin crimson proportionately much more crimson than blue I want this to be a little bit to the reddish side okay there's very little paint on the brush let's go back up here now then let's take and use just the corner of the brush using little circular little circular strokes and let's just begin laying in some happy little clouds maybe there's one that lives oh look at there look at her there he is hanging out there look at that see how easy it is to make all kinds of beautiful little cloud shapes all you need is just the corner of the brush there we go okay man then over here we'll put him had a little clout Liz right there there we go and in your world you decide where the clouds live and you put as many or as few as you want cheery decision there we go just wherever maybe there's one right there still using those tiny little strokes little circular strokes just with a corner of the brush okay let's say I have I have several brushes going here now with a clean brush I'm just gonna very gently blend this a little don't have to over blend it just enough to sort of mix it up like so there we go still using little round strokes little circular strokes you can blend this till it absolutely goes away all we want to do is blend it just enough to soften the edges so it comes already a minute watch here then we'll take this and very gently three hairs and some air very gently just bring it all together you don't want to lose your shapes I just want to soften all the edges and then you can even do like Katniss the head just brings it right over makes it look like little light streaks coming through there now then to really add a little more contrast I'm gonna mix a little more color the same color crimson and phthalo blue there's room crimson they go blue but a little darker a little more on the brush and right in here I want to show a cloud that's a little closer so for that we'll just use a little darker color and it'll give the impression this cloud is closer to us see how easy that is you can create all kinds of beautiful little things happening in here all right they would go back to our clean brush stir this up a little bit just mix it don't over to Don over to it's easy to get carried away and then very lightly two hairs of some area this time it gives the impression now that that cloud is in front a little bit so it helps creep the illusion of depth and distance in your sky and you can put a couple hair in there wherever but that easy you can make a fantastic fantastic sky looks like a nice sunset already and if you if you want to you can go in here with a fan brush and you can add some little streakers little streaky clouds that easy and you can put as many of these in as you want just want to show you how clean dry brush and then blend them right into the paintings there we go in that a beautiful sky and you can do it wash it and brush I have some paper towels over here I just dried a fan brush that's the fun part of this whole technique already now then we have to make a big decision here let's take that's take let's take just take earth phthalo blue alizarin crimson and I'm gonna make a dark dark lavender color on the palette it should look black all right we got her mixed here now then probably let me show you one other thing first one of the easiest ways to help you with a seascape because it's sort of hard at first till you practice a little I'm gonna take the little filbert brush here and to that I've added a bunch of paint thinner so this is thinners water nearly sort of sort of come in here and sketch out where you want the major wave to be and let's just say it's gonna live boom right there and this is not a commitment at this time you can still change it soon comes up like it maybe it comes over maybe the foams gonna crash up in here somewhere like that now our shoreline maybe it'll come oh I get something like it that just helps give you a little bit of sort of a layout and it'll really save you a lot of trouble okay after you practiced a while maybe you don't need to do this but at first I really recommend you do it that way too it'll help you lay it out here I'm using that dark color we made it's a very dark lavender color see if we've we had used liquid white here when we put this on it would pick up the white and you would lose this beautiful beautiful dark color there liquid clear allows us to mix on the canvas without changing the value of the color we'll just come right on down in here in here we're gonna have the transparency or the or the bright spot of the wave that's the part of the wave if you into selling paintings that's the part of the wave it sells that's what everybody wants to see that big big crasher will come right in here hmm just sort of follow this guide all we're doing here is putting in some dark color so our light will show later on I may add a little more color a little more color that's repentance phthalo blue now when you're doing these at home you can add all kinds of colors other times Balogh green is very pretty and seascapes oh it is dynamite color beautiful it's very strong and be careful with it see all of these we have all of our dark areas blocked in when you're using a big ol two-inch brush you didn't take but a second met a beautiful rich color alright now we can really start playing let me grab my fan brush I'm gonna take same old colors alizarin crimson and phthalo blue and let's head let's put some on the fan brush here just load it back and forth like it not a great deal of paint on the brush okay let's go up here maybe there's a little footling back here that's a fancy name for a rock sticks out in the water mm little Peninsula we back in the distance and this is too far away to show details so don't worry about it all we're looking for here it's just a basic shape okay tell you what - that was so much fun this - another one maybe there's another bigger stone in front of it here bigger foot but this will help create the illusion of distance in your painting and you can put all kind of things back here you can put little trees on these foot limbs and just whatever but it really helps so you chose different planes in your painting hope you can see that now if it if it doesn't show up quite low enough you can take and they had a little little highlight to it they just you get it to stand out a little more maybe that'll help can see that a little bitter now there we go good okay and that click we've got a happy little putting back here alright now we can begin putting in some of the good stuff how to start with just plain ol titanium white and we'll go right up here and just begin putting in some happy little highlights we back hearing a distance barely barely touching barely touching and sort of like you make all these little things happen bring it right around the base of this little little foot line back here now then let's have some fun let's go like right in here watch here grab it and discover all right I've liked it Oh what have we done now and maybe there's another one right here and back and let's go right along here like that right along there it's got easy that is cleaning off the old brush here okay now then I'm going to taken another fan brush it's clean and very gently very gently yeah I'm just gonna begin doing it like so see just work that back pay very very close attention to angles all you want to leave in here is the dark area this is a time when the dark areas are much more important than the light areas that right in here same thing same thing see just blend that up like you hmm that's began they looked pretty already okay yeah we can go right into a little bit of white sea and begin making all these little things that are far far away little swells that are far in the distance don't want too much detail back there okay good this is this painting it'll teach you to be an expert brush washer let's go back into our blue and crimson blue and crimson just mix it right on the palette all right now this area here we have to put dark in before we can put our light in so that's just add a little bit of dark color right here see how easy that is follow that basic angle so look at that oh we're doing is just applying dark we'll come back later put all the highlights on the good parts everybody wants to jump on these good parts but you have to do this you have to do the framework first okay now that we got some dark from there let's take some white I'll just use some titanium white a lot of paint on the brush now a lot of paint I'm okay madam grab this and pull it pull it strokes are very important you might need to wash you or wipe your brush sometimes you can just wipe it in between each stroke because you're gonna pick up some of this under color see here my cat okay yeah then that's let's get our little filbert brush here I'm gonna go into white and the least least little touch of cadmium yellow white and yellow white yellow okay let's go up here now then let's go right in here this this is the part that makes the painting so pretty this is it all we're doing here it is scrubbing in some color and the light would come right along the top of this wave because the waters thinner here look at that just like so maybe there's a touch even right over in here just a little bit right in there with a clean dry be sure it's dry it's most important clean dry 2 inch brush come right in here very very gently just begin blending this we're gonna begin picking up some of this nice rich lavender color we have down here and blending it right up into it this is where we begin forming the basic angle of the way now I beat the brush just to remove excess paint is it doesn't matter if a little that color goes up in there that light the light area will remain let's grab it before okay let me find my little filbert brush here we'll use some of this lavender color that we have same old lavender color how to touch it white end there we go now let's begin putting some foam and first we put the shadows in and you take this brush and just lay it over and just really scrub it in get tough with it get mean with it think about water churning and bubbling and maybe it comes away up here and crashes and splashes and all kinds of fantastic little things are happening and this is only the shadow only the shadow will come back and put the highlights on you in the second fill this in this needs to be good and dark also like the aunt and with our clean brush we want to continue this angle just grab it and bring it through okay now be sure you're filled with brushes good and clean and dry now comes the fun part this is what we wait on take white CAD yellow load a lot of paint into the bristles just really fill the son-of-a-gun up okay now then sort of hold a brush here and give it a little upward push and it's that upward push that's where the splash happens and when you begin running out of paint turn it over and use the other side to brush and usually you just wipe off the excess you don't have to go through the whole cleaning procedure you want to keep this color as pure as you can I'm just gonna mix with what's on there okay plenty of paint on the brush plenty of paint splashing we appear all kinds of beautiful little things are happening continually wipe that brush keep it good and clean and we'll have a little bit mm well you get carried away with these you can really get carried away in the hewa super tire seascapes are fun okay coming off the brush okay now with a good clean dry brush you just want to sort of mix this together that'll make it sort of make a different value a medium value here cuz it'll mix with the dark and the light brings it all together just stir it up a little bit okay good clean dry two inch brush just the corner and just mix this up all you have to do it's just very gently bring all this together very gently this is two hairs and some air barely barely touching and that easy we have it yeah I'm gonna take a paint thinner yellow and white and be sure your paint is as thin as ink so a very thin water consistency let's go right up here this nice bright area here there's gonna be all kinds of light shining through just put all these happy little things paint at home when you have unlimited time you can just really go in here but all kinds of beautiful beautiful little things okay come ride along here and just Sparkle that like so mm-hmm all right yeah let's take some white a little touch of the a little blue very little blue white and blue and let's begin working on some happy little things that are just floating right on down through here all kinds of little this is where you begin forming the wave this gives it shape and gives it character okay back in here just bring it right on back let's have some fun right into that light area I'm gonna go right into some CAD yellow we'll just throw that right on there right into the yellow ocher just like we did this guy let's drop it in right into some bright red we got us a fireball going here then I'm gonna reach into dark sienna a little bit more dark sienna here then right into Van Dyck Brown over here I want to get quite dark so it makes that light really stand out okay now then let me touch you white right there and then with a clean brush all you have to do is blend all this together just blends together Specter color sort of mix and then lightly lightly quickly let's go across like let go across then we'll take a fan brush I want to put titanium white or the least least little touch of a little blue on it and it must come right in here and begin making all kinds of happy little foam things just laying out here having a good time leave some of these dark areas leaves and dark areas don't kill them all begin paying attention to the shape of the wave it's very important very important over here yeah well I got to brush going I'll just take it right into some brown and that's half maybe just some sand right here all right there it is look at there just put this is just brown with a little touch of white that was left on all right down like yeah a little bit of sand on the beach Van Dyck Brown dark Sienna a little touch of white little seagulls we got to have a place to run okay yeah take a little paint there with some dark paint we just run a little lion and into here like so paint thinner with some of the light blue and we can just put the indication of a little a little bit of water playing all down here on the beach but all kinds of little lines and stuff here and there see how easy that is it really makes some nice nice effects and let's have a happy little stone lives right there this is just Van Dyke Brown shoot I tell you I will have that a little stone right there go a little bit down grab it makes a reflection take the little knife and we'll put the least little touch of some highlights on here like so the old clock on the wall is telling me got to stop for today so with that I think what called this painting finished I sincerely hope you've enjoyed it that'll give you a good idea of how to do a fantastic seascape happy painting god bless you
