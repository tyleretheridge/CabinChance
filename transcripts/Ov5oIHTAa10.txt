hi welcome back I spending a few minutes here with my friend this is mr. J and he's a little blue J Ian and he stays with me right now that's one of the cutest little rascals watching here I thought you might enjoy seeing him but he's just a little moody little baby bird and I thought you might enjoy meeting him tell you what I'm gonna set him down and we'll go ahead and get started what I'm doing that let's have him run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along today and I'm just going to set him right over here there you go okay and while they're running the colors across the screen let's go on ahead here and get started I'm gonna start out today take a tiny bit of the phthalo blue and I reach right up here I'll be right back right back and get a little bit of alizarin crimson so I have fatal blue and alizarin crimson there we go and you just mix these on the brush let's go right up here thought today maybe we just do a a happy little painting I've already covered the canvas with a nasty and even coat of the liquid white so it's all wet it's ready so we can get started now just use a little crisscross strokes we can begin just putting in a happy little sky a little more of the color there and I'm just sort of varying the crimson in the blue proportionately so we have different mixtures some of us a little bit to the reddish side sounds a little bit to the bluish side I want this to be a very soft little painting today very quiet very soft there we go and maybe right on over here just wherever you want just putting some pretty little things in the sky still using little crisscross strokes there a little more the Crimson a little more phthalo blue let's go right up in here there we go just put those in yeah don't about like so we really don't have to make any big decisions yet okay let's wash your brush and we'll scrub it with odorless thinner and there's a screen here in the bottom I can that I scrubbed the brush against that allows the solid materials to sort of settle to the bottom shake it off and just beat the devil out of it now then that brush clean has got to be the most fun part of the whole technique with a clean dry brush we can just blend this guy together that's continually mixing with a liquid white so all these beautiful little effects just happen automatically and you can but just just blend it to any degree of lightness that you want the more you blend it the softer it's going to become you sort of have to just make a big decision there just blend it still using little crisscross strokes like soft okay then very lightly just barely touching you just go across that takes all the brush strokes out and softens blends everything together there man I then tell you what let's have some fun go right back into the Crimson and back over here to the let they look blue same colors and they're just mixing them on the brush just makes them right on the brush maybe there's some little little trees that live back here in the distance all you got to do is touch the canvas and just pull it down just touch pull down see they're they're very light very subdued quiet little trees they're just sort of decide where you want them to live and that's exactly where they are to live there we go say wherever you want them and it fantastic that you can create a world that easy maybe hey things may be right up here like so there hope you enjoyed my little friend he's he's quite a characters little blue jays just a few weeks old one of the earlier shows I had shown Robin that I raised and turned loose a lot of people wrote and want to know how he was doing he's doing fantastic we turned him loose he's out living with all his friends now and in a few weeks we're going to turn this little blue journalist now I'm going take a clean brush I want to create the illusion of mist at the base of this so very firmly tapping with the top of the brush just tap this will create a very very soft misty effect just tap it we're going to get in there tap this is where you take out all your frustrations of hostilities they're better than going home and our unity spouse see their tap very firm and then lightly lightly just lift upward and see how soft and Misty that becomes that quick there we are okay maybe maybe let me find it danvers here there's one must mix up a little bit more that lavender here's some blue Blizzard crimson let this make some of the knife be right back get a little bit of height I want to lighten that just a little bit maybe touch more of the crimson there we go good good can't make clean off my knife here okay put a little bit on the fan brush just work the brush back and forth and maybe back in here maybe right there maybe there's a happy little evergreen tree that lives right there and all you do just work it back and forth we're just letting Fredi dried into nothing down here softer softer softer and we give him a friend however many trees you want your world that's exactly the right number air okay maybe tell you what don't want this side left out let's put one that lives right there just back and forth with a brush you wanting just a feet right into the mist we'll come back tap a little bit make it even miss dear I like these little misty paintings sometimes you'll find it the paintings that are very soft and Misty may be a little more difficult to do than ones that are bright and shiny but either way either way whichever kind of painting would you like and you want to do that's the right kind okay now back to my two inch brush and we'll gently tap this just tap it and bring it right into nothing it's very soft lift upward they just sort of float around and the mist there Katie but we got that old brush won't take it same brush leave the the lavender color that we had on it and add a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown same color lavender with a little bit of Van Dyke Brown just to darken it up a little let's go right up in here maybe right over in here we just tapped downward maybe there's a she asked a little group of trees that live right in here bushes and trees and all kinds of little things just let it work right on out to nothing air here we go you can hear mr. Jo bear still talking he thinks it's lunch time there we go Jenny and maybe there's a more distinct tree or two in here same way there we'll give him another one like so it's all there is to it all is to it you can put as many or as few of these and your painting as you want now once again with our large brush I want to create a delusion mist just very soft barely touching now toward the bottom of this you want to hit us harder than up here up here I'm not hitting very hard down here I'm striking quite firmly just really get in there attack and then once again lift very gently up or down maybe you want to put here and there the indication of a more distinct tree or bush maybe there's a different kind of tree you can still just use the top corner this brush just put in see just tap it turn it so you build a general shape and you can create the illusion of any kind of little tree or bush that you want back here that easy they're some of them you can just pull downward okay at the other side the brush is too pretty clean so we can tap it and once again create that illusion of mr. looks like it's maybe early in the morning and the fog hasn't been burned off by the sunshine very soft - we're having so much fun let's just keep on going here I'm just gonna take the old 2-inch person tap it right into some of that same color just tap it like so okay now then maybe there's some land masses that live in here now you have to start making some big decisions where's your land live maybe Amy you know right along in there all we're doing now is putting in a dark color so our light will show you need dark in order to show light I sort of like sort of like life itself you need a little sadness and you laughs you know when the good times coming it's the same here you need a little dark so you know when the lights are there just let that come right down like it just layer after layer there we go yeah Kenny over here same way all I'm doing once again it's just blocking in a base color here just blocking it in I kept a bit more there okay see there already you're beginning to see the lay of the land oh this is good practice for when you're putting your highlights on and let's go back over here and do a little moral in here there we are and that quickly please build up this whole area now you could just paint it on but I find that it works better by tapping it so you can begin to make out all these little indications of the land flowing and moving here now and then let's take and begin applying some highlights to that I'll just use the same old brush here go right into a small amount of the CAD yellow and because it has all the blue and the lavenders on it here when I touch the yellow it's gonna turn a beautiful green color and tap the brush like that tap it load some color into the bristles okay now then here's where we begin putting on all the little highlights the pretty part see there and all you're doing is just barely touching I'm going to add a little bit of the yellow ochre and Indian yellow maybe even sort when a little touch of bright red here and there as we paint along just to break it up and give it all kinds of beautiful little colors but in your world you sort of look at it and decide what you want there may be over here there we go we don't want this side left out see there all kinds of little things in there there is one wherever you want them to go just that easy okay but all you doing here is tapping and the more you tap the softer this will become you can make it to where it absolutely just looks like velvet so soft that's so pretty when you do it that way and at home you have more time than I do you can take your time and do something it looks much much nicer than this there okay is continually tap there this is very simple and I'm sure you'll enjoy it give it a try I get enough said this before I get letters every week from people all over the country they tell me they have finally finally picked up the old brush and they're painting some of the most fantastic paintings they never believed that they could do it and you really can you don't have to be blessed by Michelangelo at birth you can paint all you need it's a little bit of equipment somebody to show you how that's that's our job we show you how and practice you do need to devote a little time to practice there we go if you're like most of us you didn't learn to tie your shoe on the first time you tried it it's the same here with practice it'll get easier and easier okay bring it right on across like this there a little touch of the bright red here and they will Sparkle this rascal up just a little and take budget there see bit already and this short of time looks like a whole meadow out here just very soft this would be a super place to take your shoes off and sort of just run through there barefooted and find you a big old tree and sort of kick back in just just enjoy God's beauty there okay little bit right down here like so but follow the lay of the land is most important here that you follow the basic lay of the land and work from back to front forward forward forward all the time okay all right now we can have some fun Teddy you up grab my knife here I thank my friend mr. J's proving here he's over here squawking I don't know if you can hear him or not but he's sitting here with me yeah what do you think yeah okay he says we're doing all right use the fan brush here we'll just we'll mix up some dark color we had some black and some pression blue some Van Dyke Brown a little touch of crimson let's go right up here maybe their lives back in our world here right there maybe there's just a happy little tree it lives right there see just all we're doing is tapping with a fan brush just give it a little tap and that makes those nice little fuzzy edges okay now that maybe there's a leaf or two out here on this tree there and all you doing is touching and pushing downward here and use the shape of the fan brush to your advantage probably noticed we use absolutely no patterns here I don't I don't like to draw my painting out because it gives you restrictions and then you have to stay in the lines shoot this is such a free form of painting that we just sort of start off and and go with it let it happen and within a very short time if you practice you learned to compose your paintings as you paint another question that I'm asked continually is if we do any editing on these shows now I know some of the shows have editing we do not there's absolutely no editing here what you see actually happens in the time that you see it happen there see there but that easy you can make a happy little tree this kinwa let's give another little friend right there just as many or as few as you want this will give you a little practice and show you how to do there okay decide where you want to move little limbs to hang and how far they go drop them in back with our brush with a little bit of color on it red where the yellowing come down here and clean up his little foots like so there a little dark color down here indicate there's a little shadow living under this tree yeah see they saw there's to it okay maybe hmm let's get crazy let's have some fun today I'm gonna take the small knife a little bit of Van Dyck Brown and go right up in here and let's let's put some landed right in this little recent recessed area here let's just scrub in a little bit of land and I'm just using straight Van Dyck Brown just scrubbing it in using it quite a firm pressure here I really want this paint to be meshed right into the canvas looks like a little payoff out through there just sort of wanders around and you could make a beautiful little path there that easy if you wanted what once again painting is such an individual thing all we want to do here is show you how to do things what you do is totally up to you this is your world and you you create it the way that you want and if you like it then it's right and it's good painting as I say over and over again meaning should make you happy it doesn't make you happy you're doing the wrong thing I spent half my life doing a job that I really didn't want to do and now now I'm doing what I want to do and now work is fun and I've met so many fantastic people through through the joy of painting and that may be the most fun at all I've made friends of that gee I just I just never never dreamed and that's super there we go just put a little dark here and there okay yeah then let me find a fan brushing Kenny would take a fan brush would go right into our yellows a little bit of green load the brush full of color a little yellow ochre and let's go right up in here and let's just push in some happy little Bush is a come right down in this little dirt area here just right down to the edges that sort of brings it together like so just brings it all together there now that I have several fan brushes going so I don't have to spend all my time cleaning brushes I'm tell you what we're going to do here I'm gonna take a little liquid white on my fan brush and I will go right into some titanium white be right back I'll reach up here get the least little touch of phthalo blue so I have liquid white to make it thinner titanium white and a touch just a touch of phthalo blue load the brush full of color now back to our golden rule here at the end paint will stick to a thick paint so let's have some fun see we had a nice path up here now watch maybe - look at that maybe and your world there's a little trickle of water that flows right down through here it makes just a bubbling little little waterfall and stream just let it play go ride it on down wherever you want it to go see there let it go I did have fun there now the thin paint will stick right over the top of this thicker paint without it becoming mud every once - why you may have to stop wipe your brush off that's okay overall you get a a very nice effect here look at that just a little trickle of water is playing through the through the metal here and it's just having a good time tell you what let's have some fun maybe go grab some Van Dyck Brown on the fan brush tell you maybe yep right here let's just drop in a big tree bigger tree he lives right there some black little brown and on to that put in a few just a few leaves here in there as many or as few as you want shoot let's get crazy you know me I like these old big trees maybe right there be brave this is your bravery test just brown black you don't have to be too careful here just just sort of knock it in tell you what we got that brush gone let's put a tree on the other side come right over here with me and yep right here lives a big old tree all you're doing is just firmly tapping there big root down here now then I have another brush that we were using for the stream that has white on it so I'll take it and go right down the side and that'll make the highlights side of this tree and you can just plan that right together it met a sneaky way to make a beautiful little tree okay over here this one needs on two just like so put the lightest on the edge and then blend it back lighter lighter lighter lighter gentle touch very gentle hmm now then let's take some paint thinner little paint thinner on our liner brush would go right into some Brown this should be thin oh just almost like a long ink let's go right up here maybe oh maybe there's a big old branch it hangs down right there got a little arm it comes out through here if you have trouble making your paint flow then it's just not thin enough add some more thinner there okay few little things here and there wherever you want a couple over here I kept the old clock on the wall tells me it's about time to leave you for the day is it I'm finishing this up I'd like to thank you very much for being with me today I certainly hope you've enjoyed this painting hope you enjoyed meeting my little friend it will be back with you again so on behalf of the entire joy painting staff I'd like to wish you happy painting and god bless Oh you
