I'm certainly glad to see you again today and let's do a fantastic little painting yeah you know in each series you got to have you got to have a day that's a little crazy and this is my crazy day and I've got something a little different up here today I've got a black canvas here as you can see but I found some tape for later on the studio here and I've just run some tape around the edges and then I've covered the whole entire part of this canvas with a mixture of phthalo blue and SAP green and just just a thin even coat all the way over it and we make these black canvases about painting them with black gesso which is designed specifically to make these canvases this way the gesso is allowed to dry completely and then onto that we put a transparent paint and we don't let that dry we start painting on it while the transparent paint is still wet so I'll tell you what let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and as they start that let's go on up here and get started on on this old canvas this is a fun painting think you really like this what a lot of fun I'm gonna start today old fan brush and titanium white just load a little color into the brush both sides like so like so let's go up here now they just say this is our crazy day so just take the brush and just let it spin just have fun with it and let it go anywhere it wants to go wherever just make all kinds of little things and see it's beginning to pick up that color that's on the canvas the transparent color it's still wet keep the brush movie so you get all kinds of different little designs that told you this wouldn't be fun and you can't make a mistake here this is this is enjoyable glued the brush as it needs paint and there's not a great deal of paint on the canvas you really don't need a lot of paint push that brush in there and Bend it just get all those little actions Oh tons of nice little things we'll put one right up there - what the heck so you have to sort of make a decision here maybe maybe it'll come down about that far now then we can wash your wash your little fan brush would just wash it with odorless dinner and wipe it on a paper towel that's all you have to do okay now then let me find a big brush make sure it's good and dry and I'm very gently here just gently I'm gonna blend this watch here just blend it just sort of paint up and down on it like so it's all there is to it and right now all right now you say Bob you have really done it this time maybe so maybe so there look how color shows up on these black canvases oh it's really fantastic all right now then I go back and get the fan brush I don't go right into a midnight black just straight old midnight black same old fan brush load a lot of color into it okay let's go back up here now that I want to make the indication of some little distant trees that are far back in the woods so we just take the fan brush and just tap tap it makes those edges nice and fuzzy evergreen trees and I have sort of fuzzy edges and you decide how many trees you want back here wherever you want to just drop them in maybe there's one right there shoot let's go over here there's one and let's sum up I have a little crook sound don't make them all exactly straight because trees grow every which way however makes them happy maybe yep you're right let's have another one right there wherever wherever maybe maybe there's one over here like so see you can you can really put just as many or as few as you want maybe they're crowded here I think this is a condominium of four trees here they got a whole bunch up there okay now we'll take our little number to script liner brush I'm gonna dip it into paint thinner to get the paint very thin almost the consistency of ink turned that brush bring it to a sharp point came out it let's go up here and just put the indication here and there of a few little branches hanging off these distant trees just a few just a few just hard to decide or you think they should be drop them in now if your paint doesn't flow chances are you need more paint thinner on the time this paint and it's good and thin will literally float right off your brush literally flow there at home you can put as many little limbs on whose you want I just won't put if you want to show you how they're done they only give me about 30 minutes here to do this and if I don't get it done in that amount of time Sally comes out here and yells at me she's a director picks on me yeah there we go I have no sense of humor around here if you don't get it done in half an hour there okay any will put a few over here where it's just a show but that quick and that easy you can make the indication of a whole forest see there looks like all kinds of little trees we back in the woods way back here hmm I like these kind of little scenes there are a lot of fun to do extremely easy extremely and they work free there we have our little forest that quick okay they have it they find a good dry 2 inch brush and let's begin putting some little grassy areas in here I'm gonna start tell you what let's use a little bit of CAD yellow some Indian yellow some yellow ochre I'll be right back I reach up and get a little SAP green too so now we get all the yellows and SAP green and just tap the brush like so there's not a great deal of paint on the brush yeah up there now then you have to make some big decisions maybe there's a little bit of land back here so you decide how the land the lay of the land see just touch and comes right down see there easy that it all you doing is just touching and it makes this beautiful soft looks like it looks like velvet grass out here it's just so nice be a super place just to run barefooted there we go that was born raised in Florida and you run barefooted a lot there on that and I was a kid everybody was barefooted I had to watch out for the sands pers oh that's a plant that grows it had little ooh hurt your foots there people in Florida know what that is over here what coming like this just however okay and we just keep working down down down yeah when I was a kid growing up in the Florida I had all kinds of pets I've always been a creature net I love all the little creatures I had every kind of pet from alligators to lizards snakes maybe that maybe the word is pet overhead in school I grew up in the country and I took like I think it was called 4-h and Future Farmers of America and in there you you had to you had to have a project you had a garden or some kind of something and you you kept records of it showed how you made money it was like having a small business and it taught kids how to do things a super program but anyway I picked I've picked chickens I decided I was gonna raise chickens well the thing was you had to go get some little chicks and you raised him up until they were full-grown then you had to knock him in the head and sell him oh well I think you know what happened already the chickens grew up and they became my friends and I was doing real good had good grades why had real good grades until they come to town and knock him in the head and I couldn't do that so I didn't do too good in that class I talk too much let me keep going here there Hall we're doing is putting in all these little soft grassy areas wherever you want but my chickens live to be a ripe old age there okay so I didn't make a good chicken farmer I filled it got a e'en chicken farm alright let's take a little bit of titanium white on the fan brush here a little bit of titanium white and I have several fan brushes against I don't have to continually clean them let's go right up here and this is just a beautiful place to have a bubbling little stream so decide where you want your little stream to live maybe he lives right here and I start right here and there he comes see look how color stands out though on this black canvas give a little push here and there and it comes on yeah maybe there's little stones and stuff all underneath here in little places where the water splashes and hits and crashes and comes down make up little stories there you go there look at that see a little stream just just meanders around down there I think that's a word if it's not you know what I mean there we go see the rest of that story about the chickens I had to go on with this did this day though I don't eat chicken these these things became my friends and to this day I won't eat anything at aerated feathers on it there look at that little stream see has just it just grows right there and you found where lives are hides they're just wherever you want it to go and we do a lot of shows around the country for charity groups and PBS stations and etc and the thing that that most people say when I finally get to meet them in person the first thing they always say is son of a gun you're a lot taller than you look on TV and you don't have red hair I don't have red hair and I'm almost 6 foot 2 and if you've seen Steve my son on the show that little son of a gun is almost six five now so he's he calls me shorty I'm gonna take a little bit of van Dyke Brown a little dark sienna mix together and hearing they're hearing a let's go right up here and let's just put the indication of some land little stones and stuff up through here wherever you think they should be wherever you just sort of you sort of decide where you want to put them in maybe tell you what let's do maybe right here I got something right there I'm just putting in a little color maybe it's right over here okay they would take some height a little bit of dark Sienna just the least little bit of the dark you see about just a tiny bit yeah find out if you got delicate touch just let this barely just graze just barely touch did you see how that color stands out on all these black canvases it's fantastic just jumps right out at you hmm all kinds of beautiful little things that easy and back here or we had these little stones I'll put a little touch of highlight on them okay and in your painting you put this wherever you want it wherever you want it and we can take a fan brush a little bit of that green and yellow on it just load it by just back and forth like yeah okay and then we can come up here and very carefully we can just drop in some of the grassy things around there around the individual rocks and the water just just give it a little upward push a little upward push wherever I'm gonna get the small knife may be right out here lives a big rock it projects up right there a big ol Sun oh my god and we'll put a touch of highlight you don't have just a touch like so big old strong rock all right I'll put the least little touch of the liquid white in with my titanium white the liquid white we'll just make it a little thinner so it so it flows a little easier liquid white titanium I know maybe now you got to think like water maybe the water just comes right around here and it comes here and summer again somebody has pulled a stopper out June and it falls right off there so come over and down see there how easy it is this water here splashes and long and it comes out here hmm and maybe under here there's a little stone hits and Troon if you don't make those little noises so it don't work go ahead and make those little noises like so that neat and this is super easy way to make a beautiful little water falling down here it hits and splashes insurance and oh look at all that push upward with a brush making little splashes happen here it comes waters are rough down here it's five fell all the way down and II have it we need something in here so I'll go back to mode 2 inch brush they had all the yellows on it a little touch of the bright red every now and then not much just tap the brush okay let's go up here now there we want to bring some of these grassy areas right down over the stones get a little more green in that over more of the SAP green here it comes see that these little things just hang right off like that you don't want to cover up all your little little roxor that are showing leave somehow leave a few of them they're a little bit more of a color that comes just follow the angles that you put in here follow those angles there did you ever believe you could paint such delicate little grassy areas using a great big brush you really can't take in there so it looks like all that all that all moss and grassy stuff it always hangs around a waterfall cause the humidity so high you get all kinds of little hanging down plants little hanging down pants this is a nice place my mother had like the place like this she likes these quiet little places where the water please there we go just layer after layer tell you what let's do there it is I lost my brush let's have some fun I'm moving right into the Van Dyck Brown with a fan brush just load it full of paint a little bit full reach over here and get some black too so we got black midnight black Van Dyck Brown woman very dark let's go ahead up here maybe I like old big trees so put one right there big ole tree bagel tree and he's he's got a friend we just cover that one right up boy we just kill that tree back here didn't we that's alright that's alright if you learn how to make him then the effort wasn't wasted wasn't wasted a little more paint on the brush we need another one we need a big tree and he lives oh boy this is a big tree put some put some crooks anyway don't want him to straighten let him just flow right off your brush he sets out here and watches a little waterfall putting a root coming out down there yeah his jobs to watch the waterfall okay now then I won't take some titanium point and get a little bit of bright red just a little bit it's very strong I'll be careful it's easy to get too much pull it out very flat when we wipe the knife off here and cut across and we get our little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife here okay now then let's put some highlights on these big trees just touch give it a little tiny pull not much just barely pull then just let it sort of blend back there we go just wherever wherever where there see darker darker darker as it works oh it's way around the tree if you start on that outside edge and just keep working around that'll happen automatically you don't have to worry about it or anything else it'll happen just let it go let's put some of these other trees back here too we want them left out touch just touch follow the tree right I don't think so like so you know it ever since we've introduced these these canvases I think the first one I did in the series was an oval and that has become one of the most popular things we've ever done all the different shapes and designs that can be made here they're almost there's no limit to him there's absolutely no limit to my friend nat canada you were to see some of the things he's making all kinds of octagons it just goes on and on let's just let your imagination go contact paperwork's very good and just cut out a design stick it right on there paint your picture and pull it off you can't believe some of the effects I'm mixing a little they look blue and white here and I'm gonna give just a small amount and just put a little touch on the back of the tree just to indicate a little reflected light there like so a little bit on these other trees there we go yeah then we go back I'm gonna pick up a little bit of Van Dyck Brown and go right back in the middle and just tap a little all you're doing is tapping let the like the canvas pull off what it wants give you back what's left it's just like my taxman does there's nothing left Harley when he gets finished they're like so that when these when these trees dry they'll have texture they'll feel like they'll feel like real bark okay take our liner brush paint thinner any thinner will be used some black and brown get dark color we want this to be thin like ink see there to running you can see it running can't load some paint on there let's go up here at it let's come right down in here and put some nice big strong arms on these trees sure he needs an arm - you gotta hold up the wayi - the forest but a bird has to have a place to sit there there it goes and he goes in this old tree here you go branch comes out here out here so you just however many you want okay can't get a little more thinner let's do this whole big tree here maybe there's one big old limb there it is comes right down my camp down here wherever you on them just sort of look at your tree and your painting and decide where you think the limbs would be would be right there we go there's why it goes on across the tree whatever and if these are everything trees there's always a lot of old dead looking films that hang out forever paulie's a lot of them okay tell you what let's use the assumes the oval brush I'm gonna go right into black reach over here now grab a little SAP green just mix them on the brush shoot black SAP green tap some color into the bristles go right up in here and we'll just put the indication that oval brush makes all those beautiful little little leave the effects very easy all you do is just tap downward but as many or as few as you want in there this is green and black green and black very dark they're all those little hang you downs okay let's go the other tree over here put some right here I think so I think so okay okay now I have another little oval brush going here two of them and with that one I'm gonna go right into some CAD yellow and I reach up here and grab a little black and make a nice green load the brush full of paint full of paint and when you after you pull it and once you pull it and then give a little push had loads of paint right on the tip okay now they're all you have to do is just go in here and lay some highlights on these trees some bright colors don't overdo don't overdo it's too dark there it's super it's a nice way of making some very effective little evergreen trees this one here give him a few however many you want but sort of look at the basic patterns here don't just throw him on at random we talked about that a little bit over sure he's got a personality don't want to hurt his feelings okay it's a big old tree out here didn't have a super nice easy way to make some very effective little evergreens Kenny I'll be right up in here shoot look at that all kinds of little things happening there all right time to have some fun now I'm gonna pull the tape off here let's see what we have okay let's bring the camera right up here and watch here that's right here here it comes yeah just take it right off and what do they say fool ah her whatever it is you've got a fantastic little painting right there but I like it I like these kind of paintings because you can run outside of the borders now list let's take our stream here and let's just let this little stream just wander right on out of the borders letting go for a waste let it go for a ways I don't want it captured in there let it go see push up like little foam bees and they're just wandering right on off the canvas I don't know okay then we can go back to they go two inch brush and maybe look at there we can bring this hand area right on down just sort of let it wander right on out and I love the way these little pictures look in if if you're into selling paintings these son of a guns will sell like hotcakes you can certainly make a a happy buck with Emma tell you what I think we bet have a completed painting I'll take a little thinner a little bit of paint and let's sign this one right here call it finished I hope you've enjoyed this it's a little different you know really it'll give you it'll give you some excitement it'll light up your life from all of us here happy painting and God bless
