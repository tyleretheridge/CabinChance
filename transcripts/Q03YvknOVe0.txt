- Hello, glad to see you again today. Thought today we'd do
a happy little picture, maybe with the sunshine in the winter and just see what we
can develop from there. So let's start out here
with just a little touch of permanent red mixed with
a little bit of yellow. I'm gonna put the sun in here, so we're gonna start right in the center, where we want the sun to be, and this'll end up being the
aura that's around the sun. And I've already prepared
the canvas with Magic White so it's nice and wet. Now we're just gonna start
little X patterns here, and we want this to get darker and darker and darker as it works out. Here I'm using a little bit
of alizarin crimson and white. Work your brush back and
forth, keep it moving. It's much, much easier
to blend these colors when they're like this, and
then drawing a big circle. Now, we'll take a little
bit of alizarin crimson with a touch of Prussian blue into it. Make sort of a, like a lavender color. There we go. And just work it around. (light music) Okay, see how that just
comes right together. And let's put just a
little touch of this pink running right down like so. We'll just bring all this together. Maybe a little bit here, maybe have a little touch of water. Okay, now let's go into a
mixture of Van Dyke brown, Prussian blue and a little bit of white to give us a gray effect,
and we'll work that, also starting from here
and working downwards so that it gets lighter and lighter as it gets toward the sun. Too many times in paintings,
we try to avoid the sun. And the sun's a beautiful thing to paint. It's part of nature, you
see it just about everyday. Sometimes we don't see it
everyday, but just about. Okay, now we'll take
the almighty brush here and we're gonna begin hypnotizing this, and do it in little X
strokes back and forth. There we go. And we just wanna blend this color out so it's nice even distribution of color by the time we're finished. Always working with a clean brush from the lightest area outward, okay. And it's beginning to come together now. And while the brush is dirty, we'll go ahead and put
in a little bit of water, and I'm using the same gray
that I used in the sky. And you don't wanna cover up this area if you want a nice paint
reflection coming across the water. You wanna leave this area open. And we'll bring this
across, gently hypnotize it. We'll clean the almighty
brush out here a little bit. Now you can work this as
many times as you want, but the big thing is to always start with a clean brush and work outward. Okay, there we go. See, just having nice
gradual blending of color. We will hypnotize it a little. Now we'll take a one inch brush, fill it full of titanium white. And we're going straight into the canvas and we're gonna push very hard. Just push this value right
into the canvas like so. And if you wanna give some
little indications of sunlight, you can just gently put a few of these in. Just here and there, okay. Now we'll take out all
the excess loose paint. The value remains in the canvas. Now we can hypnotize that. And we don't want these
to be bright and distinct. They'll still show, even though you hypnotize them over and over and over. Okay. Okay, now if you got that done, we can move right along here. We'll take a little bit
of the alizarin crimson, a little blue, mix it together here. And we're just gonna make an indication of some nice little hills and mountains way back here in the background. There we go, just lay
them on with a knife. We're using very, very little paint. Scrape off all the excess. And we'll just let it run right on out. Okay, with a big brush,
we'll pull that down. And with a large brush like this, you can make all of your highlights and shadows in the mountain
just by using brush strokes. We're not gonna worry
about highlighting this with white like we normally do. We just want sort of a
silhouette back here. Now we'll take a little
bit of the grayish color. Maybe just a touch more brown. And we're gonna put in
some little foothills that are way back here. Just take the big brush
and tap the canvas. There we go. And we'll take a little bit of that same color and pull downward. This will make our reflections. And I'm gonna lift slightly upward, just to give it the
appearance of little trees way back in the distance, far, far away. Okay. Okay, now, we'll just hypnotize
this just a little bit to give it a watery effect. Now a little bit of Magic White. A little bit of Magic White. And to it I'm gonna add
just a little bit of pink. That's a little too much, so
we will just tone it down. There we go, that's better. And we'll cut us a little
water line back here. We don't want this to
be bright and distinct. We just want a gentle little water line to break up these two dark areas. Act just like you're trying to
cut right through the canvas. Go straight into the canvas. And alrighty, you have the impression of just a beautiful sun,
little hills in the background, foothills in the foreground. Now let's come forward
and see what we can make. Think we'll take a little alizarin crimson and a touch of sap green mixed together. Make a very warm brown color here. And we use the almighty fan brush. And let's come down and
let's just have some little grassy areas right along in here. There we go. Now when you're doing this at home, if you find that you end up
with a bunch of smiley faces because the fan brush is curved, use the corner of the brush. Just use the corner. Don't end up with a picture full of smiley faces all at one time. Supposed to make you happy, but we don't wanna show all the smiley faces, okay. Now we'll take some titanium white. And begin laying in a little snow here. And the angle that you lay
this in is very important. We want this to show a little coming down, little gradual decline. So we're gonna pull it in that direction. And let your paint break, so you have all these open spots, and the color we put here
ends up being shadows. Okay, then we can work the little grassy areas right into that. And you have those travel
with the lay of the land also. Let them sort of flow down like that. Okay. Let's clean off a little
spot to work here, and we'll make some almighty trees. Wanna take some Van Dyke
brown, Prussian blue. Little phthalo green and a
little touch of alizarin crimson. You want a very dark color,
it should look black. And let's see here, we're gonna
load the brush full of paint and let's put a happy little
tree, let's see, let's see. Right here, and we sort
of just touch the canvas to give us a guide, then
we're gonna push upward. Make a little different
kind of tree today. Just push. Okay, let's give him a
little friend right here. And we push. Just push those limbs
right out of the brush. And maybe we'll put some nice
little snow-covered bushes in here too, so we'll just lay those in. You need the dark in
order to show the light. Put your dark color in so the light will show up when we put it on. Okay, now we'll just cut through the paint to give some little trunk
indications here and there. Now we take a little bit of Magic White, and we'll mix that with firm white and a little touch of the blue that we used to make the tree. And we'll highlight this tree, and we see our light
source, so we just push. We want this side of the tree
to be a little bit brighter. There we go. Little bit for over here. Okay, now let's highlight
some of these bushes. I'm gonna take a little bit of Magic White with the firm white, little
touch of permanent red just so it sets off a little bit better. Okay, now we'll push off some nice little snow-covered bushes. So very gentle touch, just enough to get the paint to come off the brush. Here's a nice bush, we'll
put some snow on him. When you're doing this, try
to do one bush at a time and have him finished before
you go to another one. Otherwise, they'll just
sort of run together and you'll lose track of them. Okay, then we'll put a few
little stems here and there. All we're doing is cutting
right through the paint. Okay. Now, let's have some snow coming this way. Change these angles a little bit so that we have different
planes in this picture. And maybe we'll bring that
down just a little more. We'll have a little angle coming
right down like that there. Okay, seems like I remember
there was a old farmer that used to live here and
he built a barn right here, so let's put a nice barn here. And it's better to sort of scrape it out to get all the loose paint off so the other paint will stick. It's also a nice way to lay it out. Give you an idea of your
perspective and what you're doing. Just basic shape. Okay, so we'll take a
little Van Dyke brown, and let's lay this eave
here in like so, there. And we'll put some snow on the roof. Just come down and let it drop. We wanna give it the
indication that it's sort of, one of these roofs had
come over and dropped. And I'm gonna firm that back edge up. Over, down, over, down, these
strokes are very important to make it look like the
roof has that angle in it. Okay. Gonna put some wood in here, just like so. There we go. Then some over here. Gotta have a side on the barn. Don't want the cows to get out. Okay, now, let's put a little bit of snow on the other side of the roof over here, and we can firm this up. And maybe a little bit
right along through here. A little more Van Dyke brown, and we can lay some shadows in there. There. Okay, tell you what, let's give
him a little shed out here. Farmer always needs more room, so we'll put him a little shed. Little more of the brown. See how easy that is, just let it happen. And we need a little place for
him to put the hay up here. And you can create any
kind of barn you want here. It's just a matter of
working with a knife, letting it happen, and
having something inside that you wanna put on canvas. Okay, let's put a nice bush here, pushing back into the bushes. Maybe this old farmer,
maybe he took up drinking a little bit too much, you know, we all have our problem sometimes. And the woods are sort of creeping up and fixing to eat up his barn. Okay, we'll take a little
more of the titanium and the magic mixed together, and we'll put some
highlights on these bushes. There we go. Okay, and here and
there, we have some more of the little weeds
that are growing around. Just use the corner of the fan brush till you make friends with it. Maybe there's some growing right along the edge of this little hill, okay. Now then, let's put an
almighty tree in here. Let's come right along in here. Big tree, he just goes
right on off the canvas. There we go, now we're
getting some size to it. Okay, there we are. Now we can take him, put
some highlights on him. Little bit of the magic,
a little titanium, and then we're gonna
put some blue in there. Want this to look cold. This picture should have both warmth and coldness in it cause we have the sun with all the warm colors
coming right through here. So let's do this. I'll just put some nice
little highlights here. Just let the light bounce
through there and play. Okay. Now we can continue with
our snow here a little more. And let's bring this one,
have a different plane coming down through here. Just let it come right through. There we are. Okay. Just let that knife right down the angle that you want to show
that your land is flowing and try to let the paint break. Okay. Let's take, maybe we have a
few more little bushes in here, that are growing down the hill. Just push these in like so. Okay, a little more of the magic. Remember, thin paint will
stick to a thick paint, so you need to thin your
paint just a little bit. Okay, just a little touch more. And we'll put a nice little
bush, it's standing right here. Okay, maybe another one right
along here, there we go. Just sort of let your
imagination wander around. Wherever you think there might
be a little bush or tree, put it in, this is your world. Okay, maybe we'll take, put
in some little trunks here of a little tree, that just
about has nothing on it. Just the trunk left. Old Man Winter's taken
all of his leaves away. You know, in Alaska,
we have in the winter, ice fog, which settles on every
little branch, everything. Oh, it's so beautiful. It just looks so pretty. It's almost like something
out of a fairy tale book. That's probably one of the reasons I paint so many winter pictures, cause in Alaska we see
a lot of winter, so. It's a good way to learn
how to use the equipment. And we're trying to give you ideas here, trying to teach you a
technique, and how to use it. There. Maybe another little thing
coming up through here. Okay. Now maybe this old farmer,
before he left the farm, maybe he had a fence that went right along here, had to keep the cow in. And make up these little
stories as you paint. It really helps give you ideas. It makes your imagination work, and imagination is the key to painting. What to paint is much, much
harder than how to paint it, and we've showed you how to paint it. Now the imagination comes from you. And maybe we can see the top of one more little post right there. Okay, and we'll take a little
bit of color, a little white, and we'll put a little highlight
on these, just like so. Okay, and a little snow laying on top. And let's have a wire running
along these fence posts that just comes riding down like so. And all we've done here is just literally scratched through the paint. Okay. And you know, they always
have a few little bushes that grow around the posts. When you're cutting the grass, you can't get up next
to the post to cut it, so usually always have
something around here. And maybe there's just a touch of very, very light blue, very light. We can just put some little indications of shadows back here, just a little bit. Okay, now let's put some
highlights on the little bushes. There we go. And look at there. Just make those sparkle in the sun. And here and there, a
few more little weeds, sticking through the snow. You can sort of fix it up none, but don't piddle it to death. Don't keep playing with it. One of the hardest
things is when do I stop. Do I go a little bit farther? And you can sit and look
at a picture long enough, and you're gonna find
something else you wanna do, and you're gonna piddle it and piddle it, and soon, all you're
gonna have's a heavy mess, so learn when to stop. Just a few little sticks here and there. And let's put just a little
touch of highlight on this. Little happy sunlight shining
through there, there we go. See what you can do in just
a matter of a few minutes? And we knew you could do it. Okay, and when you do this at home, you have unlimited time and you can take and put a lot more detail into it. You can work out a lot of things. Here, we're just trying to
give you an idea in 30 minutes, so I think I'll just sign this. We use a thin oil with a
little bit of color on it, till we get it just about
the consistency of water. Very, very thin, and with that then, you can just take and write your name. Takes as long to write your name as it does to paint the picture nearly. Maybe a little more paint right there. And I will advise that
you date your painting so in years to come, as you look at them, or as your grandchildren look at them, you can tell what year
this was painted in, and brings back a lot of happy memories. Okay, now I'm gonna take
just a little more of the oil and put with a little bit of brown, and maybe we'll put a... there, because this is a thin slick paint, it can go right over the other
paint without messing it up. Adding a few little sticks here. There we go. And just moving right along. Okay, see I told you not to piddle it, and I'm sitting here and I'm starting to piddle it to death, so I think we'll just lay the brush down
and call that one finished. And we hope you enjoyed the almighty sun, the barn, the beautiful
painting done today. And you can do it too. Until we meet again, happy painting. (light guitar music)
