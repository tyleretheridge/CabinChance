hi welcome back I'm certainly glad you could join me today because today is a very special day recently I had the opportunity to travel to New York City and work with channel 13 there wnet and they have what they call kids day in the park and we were invited to come there and participate and meet all the fantastic people from New York so I thought today we'd do a show dedicated to all my friends in New York City so I'll tell you what let's start out and run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that let me show you what I've done I have a design cut out of contact paper and stuck on the canvas today and then I've covered this area with just liquid white and it's all wet and slick and it's ready to go so let's go start out today Oh two inch brush a small amount of phthalo blue just a small amount on the two-inch brush just tap it in Kings go ahead up here now we'll just use whole standard crisscross strokes just like so and we just put in a happy little sky just a happy little sky and by using the crisscross strokes starting at the top and working down word the color will continually continually blend with a liquid white and as we work down you'll get lighter and lighter and value and that's exactly what we're looking for in a landscape we wanted to get lighter and lighter toward the horizon there and we don't need a lot of sky in this I'm gonna put all kinds of big trees and buildings they're a demonstration that we did was in Central Park and it's so pretty there it's beautiful you can look over and see the city and son-of-a-gun what a city for the city now then without cleaning the brush I'll go back into a small amount of the phthalo blue and reach up here and get a little touch let me say that again a little touch of phthalo green takes very very little very strong color a little phthalo green phthalo blue just mix them on the brush and let's have a little water I'm going to do a scene from Central Park looking toward the city there we go so we need a little water here shoot we get crazy today just have a good time there okay and that's about all we need I'm going to leave a little area light here in the center so that'll look like a sheen of light coming across the water and we're all done okay let me wash the old brush and did you know we wash the brushes with odorless thinner be sure it's odorless or you'll be working alone shake it off cover everybody in the studio and we're in business now very lightly very lightly here just want to blend this together and we have a little sky and a little bit of water we're not worried about anything at this time because anything that we don't like we'll just cover it up okay let's mix up some colors I'm going to start with titanium white Oh make a couple of piles will this mix a lot of color here take a little midnight black and add to this maybe a little bit more we're looking for a gray color a nice gray color something mm like so maybe a little touch darker now then I'm going to divide this into two different piles take part of it we'll put over here about half and I'll reach up here get a little white and I'm going to lighten this one just lighten it up there so it's several values lighter than this one same color just lighter let me clean the knife off here okay light gray and a darker gray and the other one I'm going to take dark sienna and mix with it and a little touch of black so we have dark seeing a little bit of black and white same thing again though I want a light and a dark value so we'll take a little more CNN black and put in this one once again though it's the same color only different values now then now we can have some fun let's start out and we'll start with this light color of gray let's go right up here we have to immediately make a big decision come right come right up here now you have to decide where our building is going to live if it's going to live right along in here touch and begin laying in some basic shapes that's all we're going to do is just lay in some basic shapes we're not worried about a lot of detail at this point there we go we hope do a big old skyscraper here now this guy scraper may not look exactly like the skyscrapers in New York but it'll give you an idea of how you can do so in the time frame that I have here it's very difficult to do an exact duplicate but we'll do the best we can okay now then maybe let's come right up in here and just pull angles are very important when you're doing buildings very very important if you don't have those angles right it shows like a sore thumb there just pull it right across those angles or I'm so so important okay now then I want a shadow right there so I'll use the darker gray color that I have and maybe a little shadow lives right along this edge there like so and we can come right along here and put the other side of this thing on just like that we're not worried about the bottom we're going to have some other things on the bottom we just cover a putter we don't want so don't worry much about the bottom now this side of the building is in shadow so it's much darker there we go but notice the angles those angles are what create the illusion of a building here all right that gives us a little basic shape now I'm going to go into the brown color that I had and let's go right over in here and maybe there's another building come right up here see there it is we start out with just a little line then another one just bring it right across so all there is to it every time you want to change it a little bit there okay I'm going to change to the smaller knife and get on the shadow side pile it like so say there how easy that is and this will give us just some very basic little shapes maybe right along here just a little touch it goes right through like that and just give it a little pull if I remember there was another little building right here I'm just trying to do this basically from memory so if I don't have them just right don't don't yell at me this is just an interpretation there we go now that there was another little building right here in front so let's take this is still just the brown and white I'm going to use get that little roll of paint on and I pull it out very flat cut it off let's go right up in here right here see just give it a pull across like so there okay and it comes right on up let's see to about there wherever you want wherever you want to now take the lighter color and do the other side there okay then we need put a little top up here this one's in front of that other one so we need a little top same color over here there we go but angles are very important when you're doing these buildings very very important now then miss gonna take the knife I'm just gonna make the indication of a few little windows here and there I don't have time here to paint each one a minute so I'm just going to use the tip of the knife and just scrape in some little indications now when you're doing yours maybe you'd like to come back and put a light on some of these windows here and there there we go see they're just pop them right out there a little bit over in here as I say our day at a central park was one of the most fantastic days of my life in fact maybe we could share a little bit of that with you we took a video camera with us and we we took a few pictures while we were there and this was our day in central park and at 9:00 Jony her daughter who who's the publisher of our newsletter went with us she we had a fantastic time we met some of the most beautiful people in the world people brought paintings to show us young though there's a net my daughter job there and we did a couple of paintings and get to talk with people and was one of the most fantastic days of my life and if we get back there I hope you come and see us and spend the day with us I'm still just putting in windows while you're watching that there we go look at there there's Dana he's one of our instructors on the national staff he worked with us and painted stained a gesture he's quite a character too there okay I'm just putting a few little one two indications something like so now then that gives you a very basic idea of how to do a do some little buildings and you can put a lot more detail in a minute when you do it at home okay now that tell you went clean off a pallet and get place to work here let's have some fun we'll take some black glue Prussian blue a a little bit of that fatal green in there what the heck little crimson you can throw some van Dijk it doesn't matter long as it's good and dark okay clean the knife off here we use the old round brush today let's go right in here tap in a little bit of color and let's just make a big decision maybe maybe right along in here lives a happy little tree we don't know so very long in here okay all we're doing right now is just throwing in some dark color you guys should scrape it a few little windows in this building - almost forgot him don't want him left out people in here couldn't see come right along here if this is going to be water tell you what let's grab the base of this pull it straight down and create the illusion of a reflection there that easy there we are very lightly go across we have instant reflections and let me see here I've got a couple of old round brushes going so let's take tap this one into a little bit of yellow be right back I'm gonna reach up here get a little SAP green there nice green color and just tap this just want to load a little paint in it yellow ochre a little Indian yellow here and there okay let's go up here now maybe maybe there's some nice highlights right out here on these all kinds of little things happening wherever you are wherever you want like so so now this particular little contact paper cutout that I have today is designed for all my friends in New York but if you don't live in New York and you would like to do this shoot you can take and cut all types of designs out of contact paper and just make beautiful things I live in Florida most of the time now you can take like and cut a map of Florida out of contact paper and put it on there and paint a nice Florida scene and when you peel it off it's beautiful beautiful and I know we're not interested in selling paintings but if you should be those kind of things sell like crazy and use a little brown I hear little and egg Brown just put a little dirt under I don't want much this is too far away scratch it a few little sticks and twigs and just happy things going on okay we can take a fan brush a little bit of that same color yellow ochre green Indian yellow bright red and touch just a touch okay now we go up here give it a little upward push put some little grassy things growing right down here like in there and then little touch of the liquid like a little dark sienna and it dista just to dull it down and we cut across okay now and go up here put the indication of a happy little water line there it is and I'd like to put a little bridge right here you're looking out over the bridge and you can see we back in there so let's take let's just use a little bit of black and Van Dyck Brown dark sienna just mix them together we don't care this is your bravery test in this particular painting take a small roll of paint right on the edge of the knife there okay maybe our bridge lives lives lives here goes right there right there just be brave drop it in drop it in okay and this is I remember this bridge had a nice curve in it sure like it just like it look at their King and this side there yeah that gives us a basic shape for our bridge the other thing that's so neat here maybe it was reflected right into the water so we just take a pull a little bit of that paint we're just looking for a very basic little shape and here just really push that in and normally when we're doing reflections we pull straight down this time let's just very gently go back and forth just want to distort it a little bit and then go across and when we're all done it'll give us an indication of a nice reflection that little bridge into the water now that we have to make some big decisions here part of this you're going to see a little bit of the base underneath part so the least little touch of light color here just the least little touching don't want to overdo a little light shines through there and then bring this right around and we can make out just the indication maybe there's all kind of little stones and made this up but I want it to stay quite dark so I'm just touching just touch let the paint pull off what it wants there we go see just touch it'll take off what it won't gives you back what's left and as I mention some of the other series it's just like the taxman where he takes off what he wants gives you back what's left when I troubled is never much left there maybe there's a little rail right up here we take a little bit lighter brown just drop that on just to give an indication of a little rail a little lip that lives right in there and that easy we have a we have the indication of an old bridge there and a particular place where I was at there was some nice trees they lived right here some bushes shoot picking poop the one cover a whole building there I came right along here big tree lived here and he watched the park and everything that was going on beautiful big tree and all we're doing here is just dropping in a very basic shape okay and with a soul round brush you just tap it in don't crave at it just tap it wherever you want to reflect a little bit of it down into the water now then now then let's go over to the other side over here big bushes and trees over here to choose maybe they come all the way up right over the front of the building a little bit there just sort of look around and make some big decisions and decide where you want all these things and drop on me we own up here big beautiful tree you know you're so shocked when you go to New York and see all skyscrapers see everything in you and then you find someplace like Central Park and it's almost like you were you were back with nature again we really enjoyed our day there really enjoyed it and I've never met so many fantastic people in the life part police told us that nearly a quarter of a million people came that day okay now then I want some reflections so just make that decision and pull it down just pull it down and go gently across an instant reflections there okay over here maybe a little reflection pull it across straight down and across yeah I want to use the old liner brush with a little paint thinner on it hey we'll find us a vendek Brown a little bit of white paint thinner then this down very thin almost like ink very thin turn the brush get a lot of paint on maybe there's a tree trunk lift right there right there wherever you want there he is and he's got some big arms and come out here if you have trouble making your paint flow all you need to do is add a little bit more of the paint thinner cause a thin paint will flow right over this thick paint very easy very very easy I can take a little touch the liquid white go right in - I want to thin this paint a little that's all the liquid white does is thin this right into the yellows be right back get a little some more the SAP green there all right beautiful the way up hooker mix them all together let's go back up here how the lights playing right through here think about shape and form when you're doing these trees there there's another one see there's clumps or big bunches in there there's a limb right there that holds up that whole big one section think about it make friends with it there we are which is all those little individual things in there make friends with each one and then your tree you'll just jump a lot has character it's not just a dead old flat thing out there it has roundness both this way and this way and that's what makes your tree interesting went a little Indian yell a little tiny touch of the bright red oh nice one nice one nice one that one stands up very pretty against that bridge there we are see they're just layer after layer maybe there's a nice bush it lives here wherever you want it wherever you want it it's up to you here's another little and then we need some land so I take a little bend a frown let's go right up here need a little bit of land for that - hang on - okay little touch a dark sienna and white make us a little highlight on top there we are yeah take a would take a two-inch brush you just tap a little color into it you know that we can put in just a soft little area here a lot of beautiful grassy areas in Central Park a lot of people come out and enjoy nature and spend some time shoot those little squirrels and stuff everywhere there - bit of water line just liquid white okay now then on the other side I want the other side over here to be more in Chad with the lights coming from that way so going to darken that color a great deal very dark green but still on the round brush but very dark I just want the indication of a little highlight on these ones out here not very much though don't overdo keep this one very dark very very dark so there's a contrast so you know the lights coming seen through there gotta make those little noises you don't have to be crazy to be a painter but it certainly helps their name if you can't see those very well they are in there are little things in there can we take a little bit of brown liquid white mixture not much and just put in the indication of a little water line right there now we'll get a one inch brush just playing a one inch brush we take a little black pression blue halo green Brown it doesn't matter dark colors there was a little walkway here where I was standing so let's put in some beautiful little grassy things that live right out here there they are like so we just drop those in take some Van Dyke Brown a little dark sienna put in some dirt there we go a little white and dark sienna and just barely touch just highlight that just enough to let it graze it okay another 1 inch brush I have several of them going we'll take a little yellow and green just mix it together put a little highlight on these right out here see look how that shows up it's just beautiful little bushes right out here they may grow right back in here this was a little walk as a say in there was a like a little rail let's do that I think I have enough time to do that to just come across like so little black but that down do got to make those little noises a little bit of highlight color it's just brown and white come across so it looks like there's a little little rail right there that or a little ledge there we go and that nice okay take the paint thinner on the liner brush go into a little bit of the green just put the indication here and there a few little things that are sticking out just having a good time - I think we're about ready now then a net cut this beautiful design out for me so let's pull it off and let's see what happens here there we are in that fantastic and you can do this too so I'll take a little paint thinner go right into my red and we'll sign this but I'm gonna call it finished will side it right out here right here in the bushes but once again I hope all my friends in New York enjoy this and for people who live other places try cutting out all kinds of designs and you will not believe what you can make I really hope you've enjoyed this from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting and god bless my friend
