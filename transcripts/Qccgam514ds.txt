- Hi, welcome back. We're certainly glad
you could join us today. Today I'd thought we'd just
do a fantastic little painting that I hope you'll enjoy. So I tell you what, let's
start out and have 'em run all the colors across the
screen that you need to paint along
with us. And as usual, they'll come
across in the same order as I have them on the
palette starting with the white and working around. They'll put 'em right about
there. (laughs) All right, come
on up here let me show you what I've gotten done already. Today I've taken and
cut a little oval out of some contact paper, or any
kind of adhesive backed paper, and just stuck it on the canvas. Then we've covered the whole
inside here with just a very thin, even
coat of the Liquid White. So it's all slick and
wet and it's ready to go. So let's just have a good time. Tell you what, today,
today's such a wonderful day let's just take and make
a happy little painting. We'll use a little bit of Yellow
Ochre. We'll start with that and let's go up in here
and let's just very quickly put in a very beautiful
little sky that's very easy. Nothing to it. Just make little
crisscross strokes like so. Something like that, I don't
want a lotta color in this sky. I want this sky to sort
of be, oh, nondescript. Just very, very quiet little
sky. Maybe we'll get a little bit
crazy. You know me, I like a
little bit of action. I'm gonna take a little
touch of Alizarin Crimson. Very, very small amount. Can't say that enough. I just wanna warm it up a
little right about in there. Just the smallest amount
possible. There we go. Now then, let's go into, I
didn't wash the brush yet, we'll go into Midnight Black. Just load a little of that
on that ol' two inch brush. Just tap the bristles right
into a little bit of the color. And let's go up in here. Then maybe right in here we'll just put a little
of that black color. As that gets with the
Liquid White that's already on the canvas, we have
a beautiful gray color. There. And maybe, maybe in our world. Now I'm making little circles
just using the corner of the brush. Maybe there's some little
floater clouds that's gray that just sort of live right in
here. Just little floaters,
they just hang around here and have a good time all day. Okay, I have several brushes
going. So let me grab another one. We'll take a clean brush now and
we just wanna blend this right here. Just blend it and soften it. So it just sort of just
sits there very gently. Doesn't scream at you, it just
sits there. But now your world, if you would
like to make that more distinct
or brighter please do. Because, as you know,
on this piece of canvas you can do anything that you
wanna do. And that's what you should
do, it should make you happy. Painting should make you happy. All right, well, you know
me I like water so while we got this little brush going
I'm gonna take a little touch of the Phthalo Blue and
the least little touch of the Phthalo Green mixed into
it. Not much, that green is very,
very strong. Just a little and maybe
in our world there'll be, maybe we'll have a little
water down here somewhere. I don't really know at this
point. Then again, by the time we get
down here we may change our mind
and take the water out. We can do that, we can do that. As I've mentioned before,
when you buy your first tube of paint you get an artist
license and it says you can do
anything that you wanna do on this piece of canvas. All right let's wash the brush. That's the fun part of this.
(laughs) We wash our brushes in
odorless paint thinner. And be sure it's odorless
or you'll be very unpopular. Shake it (laughs) and then
just beat the devil out of it. Beat the bristles against any
firm object. For home use, though, I really
recommend that you look into a
little brush beater rack that you can put in the
bottom of a garbage can. It will save your marriage.
(laughs) Let's take a little black,
maybe a little Prussian Blue. Very strong blue. We'll just mix those together, cut off the least little roll of
paint. Very small roll where it lives
right on the edge of the knife. Now come right up in here
and let's decide maybe today, let's really practice on a
mountain. I get so many requests for
mountains, even though we do quite a few of
them. People love mountains. It seems to be the most popular
thing that I get requests for. All right, maybe there's a
big valley right down in here. I don't know, whatever,
whatever. There we go. Now we have a valley there. We could have another
little bump in there. Anything that you like. There we are. Okay, something like that. Now then, let's take ol' two
inch brush. We'll grab that and pull it. Just those two things removes
excess paint and it starts creating
that illusion of mist down at the base of the
mountain. That illusion of mist, that's
what makes your mountains so beautiful. It just looks like it's
floating in all that mist. There. After our removal of the excess
paint, will make the next step much,
much easier. 'Cause we're gonna put
some highlights in there. There we are. Already it looks misty down at
the base and that's exactly, exactly
what we're trying to do. And I wash the ol' brush again. (paint brush bangs) (laughs) If you haven't figured
out, I just like to wash the brush and watch the camera crew's
reaction when they dodge. All right (laughs), let's take
some white. I'm gonna put the least little
touch of, least little touch of
some Dark Sienna in there. I just want a hint. Cut across, little roll of paint and let's go up in here. No pressure, no pressure at all. And let's just begin forming our
mountain. This is where you make
all the little highlights, all the beautiful little things that happen in your mountain. And you can have this mountain
go anywhere that you want it to go. Anywhere. Just like so. That little touch of Dark Sienna
in there is just enough, though,
to make it very nice. Be careful not to overdo. Don't overdo. Sometimes these things get
working nice and we get carried away and
just cover up everything. All right. Maybe, maybe there's just a
little touch, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take some
white and put a little, little touch of Phthalo Blue. That's too much, don't want that
much. There, that's better. And a little bit of Van Dyke
Brown in just to dull it down. Just to dull that color down
some. There we are. Now then, take our little
roll of paint, as usual, and we go right in here and just
begin putting in some beautiful
little shadow areas. Just like so. But think about forming shape
here. How do you want this thing to
be? There. Okay, maybe right in here
we need a little something. Not much, though, I want that
to stay pretty dark in there. That's a deep crevasse in there. Okay, over in here. There, there it comes. Maybe this one just wraps right
around and comes right in there. I don't know. See, it makes that mountain look
like it's sort of standing up. And we'll put a few
little things over here. This is back with the white that
has a little bit of Dark Sienna in
it. And we're just gonna sort of
play these back and forth. However. There. Little hint up here, I
don't want a lot back here. It's too far away. Keep him in the background
somewhere. And we'll come right along in
here. Maybe, shoot I don't know, maybe it comes right on out
there. Wherever you want it. This is an excellent exercise
in painting mountains. It'll really make you feel
comfortable with mountains if you'll devote a little
time to a painting like this. 'Cause by the time you do this
one, mountains will never give
you any more problems. There. Okay, maybe, maybe. Oh we'll do a little right
in there, too, what the heck. Not a lot in there. Go back to our white, it's
got a little brown in it. There. Come right back in here. Now, you may find the little
knife works much better for getting into some of these
areas that are small like this. Just sort of an individual
thing. There we go. Just let those little things
just play and think about shape and form and how you want this to be. Now with a clean (paint brush
bangs), dry two inch brush I'm gonna
blend a lot of this together just by
tapping being very careful to follow the
angles that we've put in this mountain. Even in here, I want to take
the brush and very lightly, don't want to destroy I just
want to blend it together. See how gentle that is? That's a half a hair and some
air. That gives you an idea of how
gentle. Just barely graze the top. You can soften all of that. That's why I wadn't too
worried when I put it on. Okay and then over here. But idn't it just absolutely
fun? That's a pretty mean lookin ol'
mountain. (paint brush bangs) All right, now we have
us a little mountain. Maybe in our world, we have some great big
foothills that live back here. So let's take, we'll use some
black, oh a little touch of the
Prussian Blue. I'm gonna reach up here
and get a little Sap Green. Maybe even a little brown
and crimson in there. We'll just put everything in
there. Then a little white 'cause I wanna value
this down to where it's color about like that. And sort of a, sort of
a greenish gray color. Today, let's have some fun
with the old oval brush. It's easy to tell 'cause
it's the only brush we have that has a black handle. And I made that one black
so it'd be easy to identify. But as you can see, the
end of it's sort of round. It's like a huge filbert
brush only it's like one of our one inch brushes. Now then. I like this brush because
it makes it makes beautiful little roundy hill type
things just by tapping down. There. Just think about the shape
that you want, put it in there. Drop it in there. There's not a great deal of
paint on here. It might look like there's a lot
of paint but there's really not a lot of
paint. Just enough to stain the canvas. There. Idn't that fantastic? I knew you could do it. Maybe this one goes all the way
up here. I don't know, wherever you want
it. There. Okay. Sometimes I get carried away
and just let these things cover up half the canvas. When you do yours be a little
more careful than I am. Sometimes, I was gonna
say sometimes I let it get out of hand here 'cause it's
fun. And even though I've
probably painted, oh I don't, I don't even know how many
paintings, 20, 30,000 paintings now, maybe
more. I still get a fantastic charge
out of just watching it happen. Still amazes me, it's still fun. I don't think painting
is one of those things that you ever get tired
of, or ever gets old to ya. Now then, I'm gonna take
my ol' two inch brush and just pull some of that down. That'll give us a little
reflection already. Something like that. And by making this higher than
these sides it gives the impression
that that lake goes back. I guess that's a lake back
there. Makes it look like it goes
back, it has distance. Then we'll go across. Instant reflections. That easy. All right. I have several of these little
oval brushes so I'm gonna grab another one and put a
little Liquid White on it. Go into some yellow, just Cad
Yellow. I'm gonna reach up here and be
right back and get the least little
touch of the Phthalo Green. It's a very bright green,
be careful with it. Ooo, it'll eat up your
whole world in a heartbeat. Put a little Yellow Ochre in
there to dull it down a little. Now, just tap the brush. There you are and we'll go up
here. Now we have to start picking
out little individual hills back in here. Just go right in here
with that oval brush. It'll make 'em almost
automatically. Just tap, gently, gently tap. I want it to get darker,
darker, darker, darker, darker. So do the tops while the bush is
fresh. While you have good clean color
on there, do the tops first and
then work your way down. That way automatically it
will pick up the dark color underneath and get duller and
duller. That's what we want, we
want it to get darker and darker, darker as it works
down. Okay, now, maybe there's another
one that lives right here. See, by changing the flavor
of the color a little bit we can literally break 'em
apart. Make it like there's several
layers here. There we go and we just pick
out little individual things. Take it wherever you want it. Every time you want it to stand
up, put a little lighter color in
there maybe. Like that and then it
jumps right out at you. And then get darker, darker,
darker down toward the base again. That's most important. If it doesn't get darker, then you can't put a
lighter color against it and make it show up. See, watch I take a little
lighter color and that easy we can put
another one in there. There. Okay, over here on the other
side let's do the same thing right in
here. Don't want this side left out. He wants some little highlights,
too, but back in here I'm just
going to fade into nothing. Think in my world I might
put some trees over there. Gotta have some somewhere, I
like trees. There. Okay. All kinds of little doers. Maybe this one comes
on out here somewhere. But look at all the layers in
there. Just tiny little foothills. All right. Okay, little bit of the Liquid
White right on the tips of the brush
there. Just want to highlight
like there's some light just really zinging right
through. Just hitting a few things. Just a tiny bit of Liquid
White right on the tips of the bristles but don't overdo or it'll lose its effectiveness. Just a few, just a few. Now then, maybe (chuckles), you
know me. Let's get crazy. Let's take a little Liquid
White and maybe right up in here in our world there lives
a tiny little waterfall. (breath puffs out) I
love waterfalls so let's just put a little one back in
here. Way back in the distance
somewhere. Then we'll just let that just
sort of come out from there. We'll just take liner
brush and we put a little paint thinner with it to
thin it down a little more so it'll slide over the top. There, see, if it doesn't slide
add a little paint thinner. That's all you gotta do. Idn't that easy? That easy we have a little
waterfall that lives back there. Just has a super time into that
mountain. Maybe that's snow
melting off the mountain, flowing down here in our little
lake, pond, whatever it is. Body of water. There we go. All right, that's basically
about all we need in that water. All right. Let's take, let me clean off a
spot. Even with a palette this big
I run out of room sometime. That's a messy painter. You know, I got a letter
the other day from a lady who wanted to know if she had to
put out this much paint to paint
my method of painting. And I wrote her back and told
her, "No you really don't. "I had to put out this
much paint 'cause I have a "mean director here and
if I run out of paint "she has no sense of humor. "She'd come over here and hurt
my body "if I have to stop and put
paint." But at home you can always add
more color. I put a lot of paint out
here so I don't have to stop in the middle of a show and add
paint. That's all, that's all. It's like, people ask sometime,
they say, "I bought a palette and it
doesn't look like yours." Well, the only reason is I take
sandpaper and I dull this a little bit in
shine. Same as we paint the knives
black. We cover all the brush ferrules
with tape. But it's the same thing you
have. Okay, let's take our ol' fan
brush and go right into that good dark
color and let's build us some nice
trees. I like evergreen trees
and they're fun to make and one lives right there in our
world. We take the corner of the brush, we're just gonna work him back
and forth and back and forth and
let him just work his way right on down to about there. He needs a friend so we
give him another one. Maybe there's a whole
herd of trees back here. Is that what you call a bunch of
trees? Or maybe it's a flock
of trees, I don't know. A lot of trees anyway. Stand of trees, that's what they
call it. There, a few little ones
that just live in between. There's one. Okay, maybe shoot over in here. Let's just put the indication of
a few. And we'll pick out a few
of those and put some little branches on them. That'll make the rest of 'em
look like there's just a lot of little
trees behind back here. Give this one a few little arms. Sometimes when you're doing
little trees you can do little tricks
like just making a stem. Take the corner of the brush,
grab it and flick out a few little
limbs. Then when you paint other
things over it close to it, those show and it looks
like there's a very delicate little tree back in
there, too. It makes your life easier. There. Shoot, we're gonna, I'm
gonna tell you what. Let's get crazy, let's have a
big ol' tree that lives right there. Big ol' tree, I like a big
strong tree here and there. There he comes right across our
mountain. Oh, that's all right we
know he's back there. And you learned how to do
it so it's not wasted time. There. I change my mind so many times
when I'm doing a painting. I don't try to leave spaces
open. I just paint the background,
then I paint the foreground and I make up my mind as I go. That way I'm not committed
and if I make a mistake nobody knows it but me. We don't make mistakes. (laughs) Take a little brown and
white. Little brown and white
and this Dark Sienna. Pull up, get our little roll of
paint. Let me do that again,.
little roll of paint. Let's go up in here and
in our world we have some trunks showing in some of
our trees. Not all of them but here and
there we see the indication of a few little
trunks. Sticks, twigs, whatever. Take another little fan brush. I got a number three fan
brush, it doesn't matter. Take some dark green and I made
this just from the tree
color mixed with yellow. You can make it black and
yellow, Sap Green and yellow, whatever. And we'll come back up
here and let's just put the indication of some nice
highlights on our tree. Just some indications. I'm gonna leave some of them
very dark. I don't want all of 'em with
highlights. I wanna keep that illusion that
there's trees far away, too. There we go. I think that's about all we
need. Now, let's get crazy. Let's take and use the same ol' color we were using for trees
add a little brown to it. Maybe right about here. Tell you what. Maybe there's a nice
land there that comes, there it is. If you just hunt around
for it you'll find it. Comes all the way down like
that. There we are. Go right into some of the
yellows and Yellow Ochre, Indian Yellow, touch of Bright Red and then
into dull. We can begin putting maybe some little grassy areas back in
here. There they are. Idn't it fantastic? And you can do it, you really
can do this. All you need is an old
brush, a few oil paints, a little imagination, devote
a little time to practice and you can do this. You really can. I think in one of the
earlier shows we showed you just hundreds of photos
of paintings that people had done and sent into us. You can do that, too. No doubt in my mind and if
there's no doubt in my mind there certainly shouldn't be any
in yours. There we go. We got a second or two
left here, let's get crazy. I think maybe we have a little
house that lives right here. Use this little small
knife and get in here. Just make this house very small. Just scrape out a little shape. By scraping it out, that
removes excess paint. A little brown, too. This is sort of a long house on
this one. Just block it in here. Well, whoever lives here
has one spectacular view, doesn't he? Let's take a little Bright
Red, little Dark Sienna, little touch of white. This makes sort of a nice pinky
color and just go (puffs air out
rhythmically). Gotta make that little noise,
though, or it won't work. And sometime when I do
demonstrations for PBS stations across the country
I have some of my young friends
come and they'll make these little noises and
they're better at it than I am. I have met so many super young
people and they're doing some of
the most fantastic painting that you've ever seen. I'm proud of 'em. Proud of 'em. Take some white, a little Dark
Sienna, a little Van Dyke Brown, mmm
hmm, cut us off a little paint and let's just go in here
and just put a little front on this cabin like so. There. I'm gonna leave this
side over here very dark, just a little on it. Don't want it, don't
want it to be too light. Don't want it too light. 'Cause in my mind the
light's striking right across from there and so... Take a little touch of
brown make a little door. Gotta have a little door
for him to get in and out. There. Now we can go back to
our yellows and greens and let's put a little grass
around this, around this little house here. Weed's about to eat him up. Tell you what, maybe, let's take a little Van Dyke
Brown, a little touch of white and just mix it together
on the ol' fan brush. Maybe there's a, yeah
there's a little path that lives right here. Goes right on back here
in the distance somewhere. And it just plays and meanders or whatever you want
to call it right then. Like that. Right on off. There we are. Take another fan brush
and take a little white and just very lightly graze that and put a little bit highlight
on it. There. Idn't that sneaky? Now we got a little way
to get up to the cabin. Tell you what, bring
the camera right up here and let's take off the ol'
contact paper. The moment of truth. This is what we've all been
waiting for. Idn't that fantastic, though? I like that contact paper. And let's have some fun,
we have a second left. I like to let things project
right out of the painting, when we do these little ovals. To me, it's just so neat. And when you frame this,
it's unreal what'll happen. You'll love it. Guarantee. Little bit of a highlight color. Only because we need a touch
of tree trunk in there, too. What the heck. We don't want that left out. A little highlight color,
we'll drop that on. Shoot, we've about have
a finished painting. Hope you like this one. I think you'll find it to
be one of the most enjoyable little paintings that you can
do. From all of us here I'd like
to wish you a happy painting and God bless, my friend. (smooth jazzy music)
