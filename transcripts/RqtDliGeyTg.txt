- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, it's a fantastic day here, and I hope it is wherever you're at. So I tell you what, let's start out today and have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what
I've got done up here. Have my standard old pre-stretched, double-primed canvas, and today I've just covered it with a very thin, even coat of liquid white. So it's all wet and slick and ready to go so, shoot, let's just do a... let's just do a little painting, it's a lot of fun. I thought we'd start with this little tiny brush, the little two-inch brush, and let's go into a small amount of Indian yellow today, what the heck. Just a little tiny bit of Indian yellow, and we'll go right up here, and very lightly I'm just going to make some little criss-cross strokes. I thought maybe today we'd just, we'd just do a very simple
little painting that just makes you feel good, just a very nice warm little painting. Maybe, maybe a little scene that's back in the woods and stuff. I'm such a fanatic for nature and the woods and all the trees and bushes and stuff, that's really
what I like to paint. So, let's do that today. Without cleaning the brush, maybe the least little
touch of the yellow ochre. Not much, very, very little color. I'm going to keep this guy quite subdued and quiet, so you don't really notice it unless you look for it. There we go. Shoot, maybe, maybe the least little touch of the bright red too, It doesn't matter, but a
very, very small amount. Just a little pink in the sky. I don't want to set the sky on fire, and very quickly you can do that. Just want to give it a
nice little pinkish hue. Maybe a little touch more over in here. There, something like that. Alright, and then just gently going across the entire canvas, just blend out all the little brushstrokes. There we go. Okay, maybe, maybe we'll wash this brush. What the heck, i just
really like to wash brushes. Keeps my crew here on their toes. (laughs) Alright, now then, good clean dry brush, I'm going to go right in, do a little bit of the, little bit of the midnight black. Don't want a whole lot
of paint, just a little. Alright, let's go back up in here, and right on the top, I'm going to take a little bit of that black and begin making little criss-cross strokes still, something about like so. There we go. Maybe here and there, there's a happy little floater in there,
wherever you think they should be, that's exactly where they should be. There, a little bit
more color on the brush, and we go right in like that, but this is just midnight black, just knock off any excess color there because I want to keep it quite dark, and maybe, why not, why not have another little cloud right about here. And all we're doing is just sort of tapping downward with this two-inch brush. Maybe this little cloud, shoot, maybe it comes way out here, I don't know. Wherever you want it. Wherever, in your world you can do anything that you want to do. Any old thing that you want to do. We'll put another one there, maybe over in here on this side, shoot, maybe there's a couple more over here, just whatever. Painting should be very individual, everybody will see nature through different eyes, and that's
what you should paint. The way you see it. And wash the old brush off again, shake off the excess,
and there we go again. Now then, with a clean,
dry brush, and very gently here, I'm just
going to blend all this together, just blend it all together. Isn't that a fantastic way of making some little clouds, that just jump right out at you? And you can do this, even if you've never painted before, this you can do. This you can do, we try to make painting simple enough that everybody can do it and really
achieve fantastic results. Even with very limited
amounts of practice. There, and of course
the more you practice, the easier it gets and the better you get. I'm going to take a little,
let's use a little black, maybe I'll put the least little touch of, the least little touch of
phthalo blue into it also. Mostly black though, but a little bit. I'm going to have a little water in this painting, so we'll have water maybe right here, I don't know. It really doesn't matter at this point, you just put in some color, and whatever we don't want to be water we'll just paint right over it, because this is our world and we literally, literally can do anything that we want to do in this world. You have total and complete power here. There. Now then. I tell you what, we'll just keep using that same old brush, I'll just put a little bit more of the black on it, so it has black and the least little touch of blue, but mostly black, and not a lot of color on the brush. Okay, maybe in our world back in here, let's just do, doop, something like that. In fact I'm going to wipe a little of that paint off, a little more than I want. That's better, I want it very quiet, just take the side of the brush and put the indication of some little things that live way back in the distance. Little indications of trees. I don't want a lot of detail, it's too far away, too far away. Just want some little indications here and there. There. Wherever, sometimes you can just tap downward and if you want to make them look like, maybe little evergreens far away, you can just do the brush like that. There we go. Softer and softer and softer until they just basically
disappear out here. Very quiet, very subdued. There we are. Okay. Now then. I'm going to take a
clean and very dry brush, and I want to just tap the base of this. I want to create the illusion of mist down here and soften all this up, just soften it up, then lift gently upward. See how soft that is now? That tapping and lifting will push all those little things far, far back in the distance, and you can go right over the top of some of them to really soften them. There. Okay. Well we're going to see very, very little of that, so I'm not interested in a lot of detail back
there at this point. Later on, we'll worry about it, but not now, not now. We'll just have fun now. Right into a little bit of black, maybe there's a indication here and there of just a few little
bushes a little closer, so they'll be a little darker, but once again, I'm not looking for a lot of detail yet. Too soon. When we get farther into the foreground, then we'll begin seeing more. Right now I'm just interested in getting a few little things up here. There. Something maybe about like that. Okay. Now I thought today, let's have a little bit of fun, shoot, maybe we'll, maybe we'll paint something
a little different. Get our brush nice and clean and ready. Maybe in our world way back here, sort of visualize these, and allow visualizations to happen in your mind, maybe we'll have water running back through here, and maybe there's a little bridge that goes right over the water, so let's do the bridge first, and then we'll put
things in the foreground. Start with Van Dyke brown, maybe even a little dark sienna mixed with it, cut off
our little roll of paint, and it should live right
on the edge of your knife. See there? Now, where should our bridge be? Let's have it right about here. You have to make your first major decision, and all you do is just touch that little roll of paint,
will pull right off your knife. There. Maybe that's just the
top rail of the bridge, and you could make any
kind of bridge you want. I think today I'll just make a very simple one, easy little one to do, even if you've never done a bridge, this is very easy. There. There's the, here's the bridge's floor, the bottom of the bridge, so it's a little thicker
than the rail up there. Now then. And let's see, we'll put some little, some little support doers in here, we'll put one in, and maybe there's some little, yep, see 'em? See there? We're just using the small edge of the knife, or you could just use a small knife. I'm just too lazy to pick it up. There. Looks like, when I was a kid I used to, with string, make Jacob's ladders, and this looks like that, sorta. Maybe this is Jacob's bridge, who knows? I don't even know who Jacob is. There. See there, that easy. That old knife will do fantastic things. We'll put one little arm right here. Now, take a little white, a
little of the dark sienna. Maybe even a little touch
of the bright red into it. Ooh, that's nice, I'm going to put a little yellow ochre too. Little roll of paint, and right up here on the top, the lights are zinging down on top of our little bridge. Toom! So we have a little
highlight right here on top. Right there, and here and there, and there and here, see, right there, maybe a little coming on this side of the post, maybe our light's coming
from the left today. It's up to you, wherever. Wherever. Wherever you want your sun to be, that's where it can be in the painting. I hope you saw my son in the last program. Little devil's quite
a character, isn't he? He really can paint. I think he's, as of the
date of this taping, I think he's 24 years old. He travels all over the country just teaching the painting method that you see here. Maybe if he gets to your town doing demonstrations or something, he works with a lot of the
PBS stations et cetera, maybe you'll get out to see him. There we go. If you see him, hassle him a little bit and tell him I sent you. There. Now, we need something underneath here, I'm going to get the small knife, we need something to keep this bridge out of the water. Right now it would fall right into the water, because there's no little support doers, maybe, maybe there's a little post
that lives right there. I guess you'd need a pretty good sized post to hold up a bridge, so we'll make it a little bigger. Something like that. A little bit of our
little highlight color, not much, a touch, there. Sort of gives an indication of a little, a little doer there. Maybe we need some little
support brackets on it. There. Well I wish the bridge was really that easy to build. let's reflect that, right into the water. Grab it, pull down, and we'll take our two-inch brush, pull that down, and just go across. That easy. We just made a little reflection there. I'm going to take a little bit of the liquid white, and mix it with a little of the titanium white, just to make this a little thinner than normal, and we'll put a little ripple of water right around the foot there. Sort of cleans it all up, gives the impression that maybe the water's moving slowly, very slowly by this little bridge, a little slow river or stream here. Big old fish just laying right under there and resting. Taking life easy. I like to fish, though I'm not a very good fisherman. Shoot, I catch the old fish, and put a band-aid on his mouth and pat him on the tutu and put him back in the water and wish him well, and maybe I'll be lucky and get the chance to catch him again one day. Okay, take a little black, prussian blue, phthalo green, and put
some crimson in there. There we go. Mix them all up, I want to mix a pretty good pile of paint, I want to make some evergreen trees, what the heck, and some big bushy trees and we're going
to wipe off the knife. There. Let's start maybe, hmm, ready to make a big decision? Maybe in our world,
just sort of stand back and look, maybe, yep, right about there, we'll have a big bush. I'm going to push both ends of this bridge back into the bushes, so we don't have to worry about it. Right in there, and, maybe there's a big tall bank right here. There we go, there. Right out in the water. We'll take a little
bit of brown and white, just highlight a little
bit here and there. Maybe I'll put a lot of bushes on there, so we don't really care at this point. We don't even know. Some of this will show, a lot of it won't. Now we can come back in here, and drop in the indication
of just all kinds of, well, I'll tell you
what, let's just bring it right on around here. Let your imagination go. Just let that old imagination go. Maybe it comes there. What the heck. Get crazy. That's what makes it fun, what makes it fun. There we are. Now we was going to paint some evergreens a long time ago, and I got carried away
with rocks and stones and all those things, so let's make, in our world there lives, does now, a little evergreen tree right there. Use the corner of the brush. As you work down the tree, push harder and harder, forcing the bristles to bend downward. There they go. That little bit of phthalo green in there just gives it sort of a, gives it sort of a flavor almost like blue spruce, which is one of the most beautiful evergreen trees there ever was. There. Okay. Maybe I'll just put a couple in here. You know it's interesting, over the years and the long time we've been doing this period, I've had so many little creatures and stuff, and I thought maybe today I'd just, while I'm putting these trees on, cause I'm just going to put them right, I'd just show you a quick bunch of little photographs of some of my little creatures, and let you take a look see, maybe you'll remember some of them, because they're very special to me. They play a very
important role in my life, and I just absolutely
love the little devils. That's Squirly Girly Brown, she's quite a character, and there's Dan Yells the crow. He belonged to Ann Young, one of the bird ladies that
lives very close to me. There, he's a character. He's all grown up and gone now. And there's Carmen Shaw with her deer. Hey, Bob Storr, we went
sail fishing together. Of course we let him go too,
and there's my little raccoon, isn't he something? There's another picture of Squirly Girly. She's something else. She's still with me, Squirly Girly. She's almost ready to turn loose now. Almost ready. We do not keep any of these animals. We don't try to make pets out of them, because they are wild creatures, and God meant for them to be outside. The only thing that I want to do, and all the people who help them, is just to give them the best possible chance to survive. A lot of times they get orphaned or hurt, and that's
all we're trying to do. I'm going to put some
trees over on this side. There. Okay, maybe a little tree right there, there, because I really
think wild animals, they should be wild, they should be wild. But sometimes, like everything else, they need a little help, and if I can help them, and give them a little head-start on life, that's fantastic. That's fantastic, there we go. But some of them I get very attached to, it's awful hard to turn them loose after a while. There we are. I guess my love of animals was probably instilled by my mother, she always loved animals and she helped me raise little
Squirly Girl in fact. Her and Annette and I, between the three of us we got up in the middle of the
night, and we fed them and we took care of them, and it's very rewarding. I'm going to take a little
bit of that same color, maybe we'll have a little limb that comes right down here, we've got to do something with all this. So I'll just tap in some dark color, just using the old two-inch brush, like that, there. Okay. Bring it right on down, and you could fill this up here with a, eh, you could use a paint-roller, it doesn't matter. Just to, it's sort of a good place to practice and get the feel of your brush. Maybe over in here this comes, we'll have this one come right down to the edge of the water. And don't worry if you
get something in there, because we need a reflection
under there anyway. In fact, if it didn't
happen automatically, you'd have to go back
in there and paint it, so don't worry about it. See, you just grab it and pull it down. You need that reflection to set it right down into the water and go across. That easy. There we are. Now then. Grab our little thin
brush that color on it. Since it was blue in it and green in it, we can go right in the yellow, yellow ochre, little Indian yellow, and make a nice dark green color, maybe I'll get even a little black. A little sap green too, I like it. Ooh, that's what I was
looking for, sap green. There, let's go back up in here. Now then, let's begin highlighting some of these trees. Just figure out which one's in the foreground, which
one's in the background. Do the one that's in the background first. There, and then let the other one come right over the top of it. Here we are. There's another one, just like so. All you're doing is tapping, letting the bristles
bend slightly downward. Slightly downward. There. Let them get darker and darker as they work downward. There we are. Okay, let's go on the other side. We've got to give these little trees something too, we don't
want them left out. That old tree would be upset with us. We don't want that. I did the one on both sides, because I think I want
the one in the middle to be in front of the other two, so you do those first,
and then do that one, and it'll give the impression that it's in the foreground. There we go, shoot I didn't know I was going to paint a whole
forest today, but we did. It's alright. It's a lot of fun, we
got a lot of practice, so it wasn't wasted. Take an old two-inch brush and go right into that green, so sap green, the Indian yellow, yellow ochre, a little touch of the bright red, now and then only. Load some color right onto the bristles. Let's go up here. Now then, let's begin
making big decisions here. Let's have a little grassy area comes right down like that. There, just tap, and the more you tap, the more of that base color that you'll pick up and the darker it'll become, it'll just disappear after a while. You have to decide. There. Okay. And you can do this over and over until it gets just as soft as silk. Looks like velvet grass
laying there if you want to. And the more you tap it,
the softer it'll become. Alright. Just layer, after layer, after layer. There. Okay, right down in
here, a little something. Right on down. Okay let's go on the other side and put a little over there. Maybe it comes right down like that, sneaks right out of those trees. You can do it. You can do it. Okay, tell you what. Take some Van Dyke brown and dark sienna. Just going to put a little
indication of a little soil, a little dirt right down
here at the water's edge. Something maybe about like that, I don't want a lot. Just a little, just a little. A little of that brown and white, give it a little, tiny bit of highlight, don't want much. Then I can take a little,
a little fan brush and just pop in some
little bushes down here. Brings it all together. Little bit of the liquid white and the firm white mixed together. There we can come right back in here. There, just put us in a little, a little watery line there, okay. Shoot, I need to play it way to get to this little bridge back here. So let's take a little Van Dyke and dark sienna mixed together, and just put the indication of a little, a little path right in there. Choom! Take some white, maybe even a little of the bright red, the yellow ochre, be brave. Barely touch, just let it sort of graze across there. Choom! There. Right on out. Alright. Now then. Take our brush with a little grassy colors and just bring some right
up to the edges here. Something about like that. If you want a little more distinct bushes as we get closer, we'll use the fan-brush
and just pop them in, pushing upward. There we go. Now. Let's find a nice one-inch brush, I'll dip it right into a little bit of, a little bit of the liquid white, we'll go into some green and yellow, pull it in one direction. Now, let's take... put some nice highlights on
all these little things here. Start with the one, as usual,
that's the farthest away, and work forward, always working forward. Let them just hang right
out over the bank here. There they are. All kinds of little things. One little bush at a time, but don't get greedy, I know it's tempting. I know it's tempting. One at a time. It's all we're looking for. Just drop them in. Maybe even over here, shoot there's one little, two little, three little bushes right there, whatever you want, just
something to sort of break it up a little, maybe back in here there's a few. You can even have one
or two right in here. There we are. Let's grab an old fan-brush, shoot. You know me. I always have to have the big tree. Let's take some of the
browns, both browns. Here's your bravery test. Sswukk! Make those little noises. There's the little tree, and there's his little brother. So, we've got to give him, got to give him a little friend there, don't want him to get lonely out here. I'm just going to touch a little highlight to the edge of these little rascals. Just a little, we'll take our little script liner brush. Going to dip it into a
lot of paint thinner. I want it to be as thin as ink. Very, very thin. Look at there, just absolutely
drips right off there. Nice, soupy. Okay, let's go up in here. Now with that we can come back in here, because it's a very
thin paint, it'll slide. We can just run it right over the top of all these little doers. Put us all kinds of
little branches and limbs, and things like that on here. Maybe these old trees, maybe they're dead. Maybe we've just got naked limbs out here. There. If you want to put a few leaves on, you certainly could, it's up to you. I think today I'm going to just leave them sort of hanging around. Something about like that. Something about like that. There. And, you could just take a knife, and here and there and there and here scrape in a few little sticks and twigs, things like that, and you're about to the point you have a little finished painting. Hope you try this one. It'll really... you'll enjoy it, so give it a try and send me a photo, let me see how you do with it, and from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless my friend.
