(jazzy music) - Welcome back, certainly
glad to see you today. You ready to do a fantastic
little painting with me? Good. Tell you what, let's have
them run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with me. While they're doing that,
let me tell you what I've already done up here. I have my good old 18
by 24 inch canvas here. The top of it I've
covered with a dead even coat of liquid white. Then we have a piece of
masking tape right across here. Slightly above center. Then the bottom of this canvas
is covered with Liquid Clear. A very small amount of
that clear down here. Thought today we'd do a
little tropical seascape, I've had so many cards and letters asking for just a bright shiny little seascape, thought I'd show you a
very easy and effective way of doing one. So let's go up here and get started. Today I'll start with
the old two inch brush. Go right into a small, small
amount, very small amount, of the Indian Yellow. Just tap a little into the
bristles, come right up here. And we'll just do
something, about like that. Just let it go right on out. Without cleaning the brush,
I'm gonna add a small amount of Cad Yellow, and just run it on out. Don't have to clean the brush at all. And once again, without
cleaning the brush, I'm gonna add Yellow Ochre. And we'll take that all
the way up to the top. Just like so, there we go. Now then, still without
cleaning the brush, I'm gonna add just a
touch of the Bright Red. Gonna come right along the top, making little crisscrossy strokes. All the way across the top here, and then just very lightly
blend that into the ochre. Like so. In here maybe you can tap in a little bit, to make a little streak in
the sky, wherever you want it. Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah. Right here, we'll put another, wherever. Just sorta look at it and make
a big decision to put it in. There, wasn't that a
bright shiny little sky? Easy to do, easy to do. Gonna clean the brush. Scrub it off, shake it. (laughs) Then just beat
the devil out of it. Now then, let's have some fun. Let's have some fun. Take Alizarin Crimson, load it right into the two inch brush. Be right back, be right
back, don't leave me. And I wanna get a little
bit of Phthalo Blue, just mix it right on the brush. Let's go right up here. Underneath here, gonna add a little bit
of that lavender color. Right there, just a little touch, little touch. And this lavender you
can mix with the yellow without it turning green. Even though you have blue in it. As long as it's predominantly crimson, you can mix it right up against
there and get away with it. Now then, without
cleaning the brush again, I'm gonna add more of the Phthalo Blue, just a small amount, doesn't take much. Doesn't take too much,
and we'll come right down, right down to the horizon here. And add Phthalo blue,
it's a very pretty blue, I like Phthalo Blue. It's a very nice blue, spelled funny. There. Now very lightly, very lightly, just blend the entire sky out. And we can wash our brush one more time. That's the fun part of
this whole technique, The camera people don't
think it's so much fun. Okay, now then. Let's use the knife today, what the heck. I'm gonna take some Titanium White, and pull it out as flat as I can get it. Just really get strong,
pull it out very flat. Go straight down, and cut across. You have that little roll of paint. Okay, let's go up here. Let's make some little clouds that just, just hang around here and have fun. Pushing very hard, very hard. Very hard, just, just lay in some basic
little cloud shapes. I don't want these to be bright clouds, just little floaters. Just little floaters, little fun clouds. Good time clouds maybe. There's one, comes
right down through here. See there, and in your painting, you put them wherever you want them. Maybe there's, shoot who knows. Maybe there's one that floats around here and has fun all day. Maybe one that goes right on
off the edge of the canvas. Just wherever, wherever. Maybe they go right down to the horizon. There. Now then, clean dry brush. And it's time for your bravery test. Come right up here and very lightly, very lightly, two hairs and some air, just blend those little
clouds, barely touching them. Barely touching, you take the brush, another way of making
clouds, for this type. Just tap a little white into it, and go up here and literally just tap it right onto the canvas like so. Just tap tap tap tap tap. And, maybe right along
here there's another one. All you have to do is
just sort of tap along, and very lightly, very lightly just blend them. That's a super easy way of
making some cute little clouds. Okay, one more time. Now then, Let's take the tape off. And you'll see you have a
perfectly straight horizon. That's one of the nicest
easiest ways of getting a straight horizon I've ever seen. When you're doing a seascape. Now then, I'm gonna mix up, let's take some Phthalo
Blue and Alizarin Crimson, mix it together. That's very difficult, very difficult to tell what color that is, it just looks black. If you wanna find out, reach over here and get a little white, and mix it in there and see what you have. If it's a color you like, super. If it's not, this is
the time to change it. This is the time. Now, one of the things when
you're doing a seascape, if you'll sort of figure
out basically where you want the major wave to be in here. It'll save you a lot of problems. So let's say our major wave,
it's gonna live right there. And just sort of take the filbert brush, and just sketch out a basic shape of where you want that rascal to live, like so. And it's gonna curl over like that. Now. Once you have that in, then you could lay it all out. Let's just use the old two
inch brush, shoot that's, tap a little of this dark
lavender color in here. Let's go right up here,
and let's just begin putting in some color. Like so. Like so, just let it come
right along that horizon. There. Just right along there. And you come right down
to this major wave, it really doesn't matter if you get it, it's just a guide, it's only a guide. And I think you'll find
that it really helps you to put that in though. Now I'm gonna add a little
touch of Phthalo Blue to that same color,
I'll just use the brush to sort of mix them together. So I put a little more blue into it. And with that, we'll go
out to the edges here. Want the edges to be a little
bit more to the blue tone. There. Then just fill this in. And same thing over
here on the other side. Just fill it in, right up to that. Boy, that quick you have the whole back of your seascape done. Same old brush, still haven't cleaned it, I'm gonna use some black, a
little touch of Phthalo Blue. Once again, just mix them on the brush. And let's go right up in here and do that. Just put a little color in. See because the liquid
clear is on the canvas, the color stays true. If you have liquid white on
the canvas when you did this, it would dilute the color. With the liquid clear, you
don't have that problem. There we go. But I can't tell you enough to just use a small, small amount. It goes a long way. One container of clear
should last you for years. There we go. And right on up to the
other side back over here. There we are. See there? Shoot, you've got your
seascape half painted already. That easy, alright alright. While we have a little brush going, we might as well, this
wave's gonna be curling over, so we can add some dark colors. Now if you're uncomfortable using a brush this big to do these things, use your smaller brush. Either one will work. There we go, see we just put that in. Alright, I have several
brushes going here, so let me grab another one. I'm gonna take a little Dark Sienna, we'll just put it out
here, a little Dark Sienna. I'm gonna grab some Yellow Ochre, Yellow Ochre, reach up
here get some white. So I've got Dark Sienna,
Yellow Ochre and white. There, just tap it into the bristles. Let's go right in here, maybe there'd be a little
beach that lives right here. Right there. And just let that blend right
up into the water color here. There we go, just let it blend together. Like so. We have the entire canvas blocked in now. Now we can begin getting serious about it. Okay, start with a knife. Take a little bit of the Titanium White, pull it out very flat, just
as flat as you can get it. And take the knife and cut across, and get that little roll of paint, Always loading the knife with
that little roll of paint. And let's begin making some little waves that are far, far back
here in the distance. Barely, barely can see them, they're just little teeny ones. So use a firm pressure, and push, just push. Firm pressure though, you really, the knife is literally bending. Literally bending. Just put some little
sparklers here and there. Just here and there. And when you push that
hard with the knife, there's little ridges of paint, here. Little ridges of paint,
we'll use those later on. That's what we'll place our highlights on. All the little sparklers. But I'm putting a tremendous
amount of pressure here, really getting strong, take out all your frustrations this way. There. And right on over, and maybe a couple of
little doers right here, wherever you want them. This is just sort of an individual thing. Okay now we can even take
a little of that white, and push it right on top of that. Right up here on top, like that. Now then. I'll use a little touch,
we'll just use that same color that we used to make sand, add a little more Yellow Ochre, make it a little brighter. And white, so it's quite bright. Pull it out, cut across, get the teeniest little roll of paint. Tiny little bit of paint. And lets just go up here and just, very gently just let it
graze those high points. Just let it graze, don't
want a great deal of paint. Just barely, barely grazing, caress it. Just caress it, just touch, barely, barely touch. Okay now I'm gonna take Titanium White and the least little bit
of yellow, Cad Yellow. Titanium White and a little
tiny bit of Cad Yellow, tiniest little bit. And once again, pull it
out flat, cut across. And we have the tiniest
little roll of paint out on the edge of the knife, okay. Now then, with this we can really sparkle. Decide where the light
is striking the water. And that's where you
put your bright spots. Barely touching, barely touching. And however may you want, or few. There we go. Then we'll have that cut on there, I wanna add a little bit right there. (whistles) That easy. Maybe even back in here, We'll just put a little
bit right in there. Okay now then, let me
find a fan brush here. Take a little Titanium
White on my fan brush. And let's put another wave, zoom, he lives right here. Comes right down, (imitates wave breaking) gotta make those little wave noises. Now a bit of white right there, and maybe this one just progresses on out, we don't know where it goes. Now then, very gently, grab that and just sort of blend it back, just blend it back. And it makes the trough
in between the waves. Just gently blend it back. Now, tell you what, I'll
show you something here. Let me get a little bit of that yellow. I wanna put a little of that
bright yellow right here. And maybe right here, just lay a little bit on, little bit on. And we'll take that fan
brush, wipe off the paint, and grab that yellow and blend it back. So it looks like there's
sunlight just laying in between there and, playing having fun. There, now, blend this back, see how bright and shiny that is, boy the light's really
striking right along there. And it gets darker, darker,
darker as it works away. Then right above this wave here, just blend that light in. There. Hmm, that's pretty. Just a bright little rascal. Okay I'll take a little white, least, least little touch of
Phthalo Blue on the fan brush. White, little touch of Phthalo Blue. And let's go right up in here. And you could just come back in here, and add in little touches of color. Just here in your white Phthalo Blue, hope it shows up enough so you can see it. There, here and there. There we go. Just sort of drop those
in wherever you want them. Okay, right over, there
and here and everywhere. But you're always using
this little rocking motion. Just little, guess that's
a good word for it, little rocking motion. It helps create the
illusion of all kinds of little waves and stuff happening. without actually doing a whole bunch. There, little bit of that blue
just shining right through that bright spot there. Time to have some fun. Let's do the eye of the wave, that's always what everybody wants to do, that's the fun part. Take the filbert brush, a little touch of the
Cad Yellow and white, load a lot of paint on the brush. And let's go up here
and get tough with it. Just get in here and scrub it hard, really scrub it, scrub it. And then begin working out. See that's another
reason we do this sketch, because you don't want paint in here, you wanna keep that pure. Now then, begin working outward. Outward outward outward. And automatically it'll
get darker and darker as you run out of paint. There, begin shaping and forming the wave. Darker, darker, darker,
right on out to nothing. Now then, clean dry, be sure it's dry, two inch brush, and use just the corner, and all we're gonna do here
is just stir it up, mix it up. Tiniest little circles,
tiny little circles. You can blend this 'til
it's as smooth as glass. Now, let's begin shaping our wave. Grab it, and pull, see? Grab it and pull. Isn't that neat? That easy, you can create
the shape of this wave. That easy, that easy, there it is. Let me find a fan brush, I have several fan brushes going also. I'm gonna take a little of that white, that has the least little
touch of yellow in it. Now then, let's do this
big crashing wave here. Grab it and pull. (imitates wave breaking) Make the little noises. And it'll pay you to wipe
your brush between each stroke and re load it so you get
nice clean color there. This is the part of the painting that everybody wants to see. And if you're out selling paintings, of course none of us
interested in that happy buck, but if you're out selling paintings, this is the part that sells. Use the old filbert brush here. And I'm gonna load a touch, just a touch, of this lavender color
we had on the brush. Okay let's go up in here. Now then, lets put some foam. We'll put the shadow in
first, put the shadow in, there we go. And all we're doing is
just scrubbing it in. Put the shadow in, put the shadow in, let it just come round, this is where you begin shaping your wave. Right there, there's a, let the shadow just, wherever you want it. Here it comes (imitates wave breaking) Big splashing thing, there it comes. Put the shadow first though. Wash your brush, then
wipe it on a paper towel. be sure it's as dry as you can get it. Now, let's go right back into our, this is our mixture of titanium white, with the least little
touch of yellow in it. Load a lot of color into
the bristles, alright? Now then, just sort of
give it an upward push. And put the highlight right up on top, right up on top of all that. Turn the brush, use both sides. Now when it runs out of
paint, wipe it off good, get all that blue and
lavender color off of it. Come back with your nice color, see. (imitates wave breaking) Make those little noises, it really helps to get you in the mood. And then just sort of
bring it all together. There. Okay, now then. With our clean dry two inch brush. once again, I'm just grabbing
this and gonna stir it up. Tiniest little circular strokes. Blend that right into the
shadow, except the very edge, you don't wanna blend that
edge, you wanna save it. Just blend it, blend it, blend it. Now you could use the
one inch brush for this, but the two inch brush I like to use, because it seems to have more hair there. It really seems to work a lot nicer. We can put a little touch
of that highlight color over here on the other side of that wave. Pull it down, so it
looks like it continues. Okay, let me find my little liner brush. Take the liner brush,
I'm gonna go into some, Titanium White the least little
touch of Phthalo Blue in it. Now let's just take this,
come right along here, and begin adding some
highlights here and there. Just like so. Now at home, you have unlimited
time and you can just put all kinds of beautiful
little things like this. Here, you know, they
have no sense of humor. Shoot if I go over 30
minutes they get upset and start yelling at me. There we go. But these little things,
these little things, help shape and form your waves. All kinds of little good-ers here. Fan brush also works very nice. Take a fan brush, little touch
of Phthalo Blue and white. And begin just putting
in all kinds of little, little foam patterns that
are moving and playing. But this is where you, once again, where you create the shape of your wave. As it goes out it's getting
flatter and flatter. There. Maybe, tell you what, tell
you what, right out here, oops, there we go. Now we can begin, just laying a little bit of
foam that's laying down here. This is just Titanium White, but it's picking up
all those little colors that are underneath. Leave some openings,
leave some holes in it. So you can see the sand and
the water all through it. Hmm, pull, like that, still making those little rocking type strokes. Travels right on up the wave. Now right underneath this wave here is gonna be a little darker
because it's a shadow, created by that wave. So brighter out here and lighter there. Okay, now then. Script liner brush, little
bit of the lavender, and we need to have a little dark line that lives right under this,
it'll pop that right up. Right up, and you can
come back in here and put just all kinds of little
things wherever you want them. Tell you what, this is
gonna be a tropical scene, we need a happy little palm tree in there. Show you the easy way of making
indication of a palm tree. We'll just use Van Dyke
Brown on the fan brush. Load it full of color,
let's go right up here. Decide where your palm tree lives. Maybe this palm tree,
maybe lives right here, goes right off the canvas. We don't know exactly where it goes. Let's give him a friend, we
don't want him to get lonely. Ooh, right through the crasher, hmm. There, now we got two palm trees. Pretty soon, you know how palm trees are, pretty soon there'll be three. Now then, now then, take a
little black, a little white, make sort of a grayish color here. And with that, let's just
put a little light on this. Just a little light, see, like so. Right up the old tree. Shoop de doop de doop. There. Okay, you can take the liner brush with a little dark color on it, and really work it making
little doers like that going all the way up the tree. Okay, fan brush, let's make
some big leaves out there. Dip the fan brush into paint thinner. I'm gonna take, black, ooh, gonna get it thin like water. Like ink, a lot of thinner in there. It's very thin, It'll run on ya, okay. Now then let's come right up in here, decide where your big palm leaves, maybe this one comes right around, shoom. And because this is so wet and thin, can grab it, look at that. See there? And that easy, you can make all those
beautiful little shapes. Now then, just wherever you want them. Think about how your palm tree gonna look. Sometimes you can see both sides, sometimes one side. There's one. This is one of the easiest
ways I've ever seen, to make a striking little palm tree. And this black color against
that bright background. Oh, really really stands out. You'll like that. Don't want this other one to get left out. We'll give him a nice limb. Just grab it, pop it, shoom. Here comes another one, goes
right out through there. Grab it, give it a pull. Another one, maybe one right here. Just however many, and a little one. See there? That's one of the nicest ways there is, to make a little palm tree. Hope you enjoyed this little
tropical sunset type scene, and I look forward to
painting with you again. Until then, happy painting and God bless. (jazzy music)
