- Hi, welcome back. Well here we are with the last show of the 26th series. So let's have a lot of fun today. Tell you what, let's start out the day and have them run all the
colors across the screen, that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got done up here. I have my regular old
pre-stretched double primed canvas. And today, I've painted the entire canvas with black gesso and allowed
that to dry completely. After the gesso was completely dry, then I've covered it with liquid clear, just a very thin coat of the clear. And on top of that, we've
just applied a very thin coat, not a whole lot of paint, a very thin coat of midnight
black and prussian blue. The entire canvas is
absolutely covered with it. And with that, let me show you how to do a fantastic little painting. Let's just start out
today with a small amount of the titanium white on
the old two inch brush. Do just a very quick,
simple little sky up here. I think maybe today, I think maybe, we'll do just a happy little waterfall. I like waterfalls. There we go, so I'm just
going back and forth. Making sort of little crisscross strokes but using the brush this way. Something maybe like that. So I say in this one, I want a very simple, quick little sky. Just something to throw in
a little background color, and then we can get on
to the serious business. 'Cause I want to play
with the big waterfall. Alright, let's clean our old brush. I just really like cleaning
the brushes, you know. There. Shake it off. (chuckles) And just beat the devil out of it. Now then, clean dry brush. All I'm gonna do is just blend this. Just blend it, about like that. There, because I'm gonna put things way up into the top of this, and I'm not looking for a lot of color, maybe just a touch more right there. Not looking for a lot
of color in this sky. Something like that. And that should be enough for us. Now way back in the background here, I think we'll have some little trees that live way up on the
side of a hill somewhere. So we'll take blue and black and oh, maybe a little
more black than blue, but pretty close to equal proportions. Pretty close. You just sort of decide in your world which way you want it. Now you'll probably have to
put a little white with it if you want to really check the color because it's impossible to tell if that's towards the blue side or the opposite direction
toward the black side. And I'm just gonna tap down. Maybe in our world, way back here, I'm gonna put the least
little touch of white on one side of the brush, see. Now I want to start getting an indication of just little trees that
live way back in there. Alright. A little bit of white just
on one side of the brush. Just one side. Maybe, I'll tell you what, these trees maybe just go
right on off the canvas, I don't know, don't know
that it really matters. It's up to you. It's completely and totally up to you. Whatever. There we go. But all we're doing here
is just tapping downward. It's really all we're doing. Okay. Something like that. These black canvases are so
fantastic, absolutely love 'em. I could do a whole television series with nothing but black canvases 'cause they are, I think,
my absolute favorite. Color shows up on the
black canvas so much better than it does on a white canvas. Tell you what, let's take, we'll take our two inch brush and I want to create the
illusion of mist here. So I'm just gonna begin
tapping this, just tap it. Go into the least little
touch of titanium white, oh the least little touch,
least, least little touch. Tiny, tiny bit, and I'm just gonna pop in some little indications of some little floaty clouds up here. This is so high up, maybe there's some little clouds in here. Takes very, very little color though. Very little color. There, something about maybe like that. There we go, wherever you want 'em. Now we can take our little blender brush, very soft little blender brush, and I'm just gonna soften
these little clouds, just gently, gently soften them. Something like that. There they go. Just let them float around up
here underneath these trees, just have a good time. Now the more you blend these, the more it's gonna pick up
that blue and black color that's underneath, and the
more they'll disappear. So you take them to any degree
of brightness that you want, or softness, it's up to you. Now, let's go back to our little brush. There we are. And let's have, yep, how about right here. Let's have a few trees
right over on this side. And we'll just let them come right down, right on down, maybe they just
go right on down into here. I don't know, doesn't much matter. You put 'em where you want 'em. There, something like that. Alright, maybe right there. This is just some background foliage. Just so we have a place for
our little river to come from. If we're gonna have a little waterfall, we need a water source, in other words, a place
for the water to come from. There we go. So we'll just do it like that. If you've never painted on a black canvas, you really ought to try it. You'll be amazed at what you can do. Absolutely amazed. Going back to my two inch
brush, and just soften this. I know that may be difficult to see because it's all black, but believe me, when you do this, it'll work for you. It'll work for you. There we go. Now then, let's start coming forward in our little painting here. I'm just gonna continue to
use this same old color. We're gonna use it continually
throughout this painting. Load the fan brush full
of paint, a lot of paint. Let's go right up in here. Now maybe, see I wanted this cloud here, 'cause it's a little lighter, and when we come back and we begin putting some
little trees in here, there's just enough contrast
that they'll show up. Just enough so they'll show up. Maybe in our world there lives
a little tree right there. And there's another one. There's another one, you knew. You knew. If you've painted with me before, you know I love to
paint trees, and bushes, and mountains, and all
these kind of things. There we are, that's really
where I'm the happiest, is in the landscape painting. There. Alright, maybe, oh what the heck. Let's make a forest out here. It's our world, we literally can put anything in it that we want. Anything that we want. Okay. Maybe there's another
one over here, too, then. This painting will give
you a lot of practice doing some gorgeous little trees. There we go. We have to start making
some decisions here. Have to start deciding if
we're gonna have a little, if we're gonna have a
little river in here, we gotta start deciding
where it comes from. I'm gonna take some of that
black, blue, little white, something like that. Looking for a bluish-gray color. Cut off a little roll of paint and it's right on the
edge of the knife there. And maybe in our world, our
river bank is right about here. I don't know. See, it takes almost no
paint here, almost no color just to do all these fantastic things. Get a little more paint. There. And all I'm doing is just
rubbing with a knife. I'm just literally rubbing
color right on there. And here and there I'm gonna
give it a little upward push just so it blends with all
that is already on there. I don't even know where that goes, don't know that I care right now. Now we can take a clean fan brush and just grab a little
of that and pump it up, make it look like, see, looks
like little bushy things. Sneaky, huh? There they go, there they go. Just wherever you want 'em. Wherever you want 'em,
wherever you want 'em. Little bit of that dark color. I want a little dark edge there. I know you can't see that, but it's there. And I know it's there, I need it 'cause I'm gonna put some
water right along in here. We know it's there. There we go. Something about like that. Alright. Now, let's take some white, on a lighter color I'm gonna add white. So there's white, blue, and black. But it's much lighter. Once again, cut off that
little roll of paint and we'll go right up in here. Gotta make a big decision. Where is our water coming from? There it comes, there it comes. Maybe a little lighter
so it shows up better. Yeah, there. There it is. It just meanders down
right along through here and comes around. We don't know where it comes from. And maybe it gets out here and-- Uh-oh. (chuckles) Somebody pulled the cork right out. Somebody pulled it out right there. Right there. There, here we go. It's coming down again. This is almost down and then
it get's over here and-- See there. And there's the base of
our waterfall, right there. We just made a big decision. This is where our waterfall is
gonna live in this painting. There, and sometimes it's fun just to paint the whole
waterfall with a knife. Shoot, maybe we'll just do that. Sometimes that's fun, too. Take a little of that white
color and here and there, just sort of highlight a little bit so it shows up a little better. There. So I've mentioned before in this series, you can do entire paintings
using nothing but the knife. This knife, once you make friends with it, it does take a while to
make friends with it, just like anything else in life. There. Now, see we have a
little background color. Maybe, let's take pure titanium white, I want to get a little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife, just like before, but
this is just pure white. And I'm gonna come right in here and just let it break. Let that color break, let it break. See there? Just go over. Don't overdo though. This get's feeling good. And you don't know when to stop. But something about like,
it's all we're looking for. There. Isn't that a neat little
way to do a watery fall? You can do a watery fall
just using the old knife. And we can take our two
inch brush and very gently, real gently, or you can
do it with a blender. Just pick it up and sort of blend that
together a little bit. See there, now we have water just spilling right over the edge. And down here at the base of this, certainly with all this
much water falling, there'd be all kinds of
beautiful, misty areas that are just floating around down here. Float right on up, who knows? All kinds of things. Wherever, wherever. There. Go back to our little blender, 'cause it's so soft, we can
just get in here and blend that. Something about like that, just blend it, blend it, blend it. And take a little color
right on the blender here. Get a little more. There, we can just paint in
all kinds of little clouds and little fluffy things
that are living in here. Isn't that neat? Something like that,
wherever you want 'em. There we go. Boy, that water is churning and raising the devil down there isn't it? I love waterfalls, I could
paint waterfall after waterfall. I think they're so gorgeous. I lived in Alaska, I
spent a great deal of time just watching waterfalls
and photographing them. Oh, they're gorgeous things. Maybe down here at the
base of our waterfall, maybe there lives, does now, some great, big old stones down here. We'll just use that same color
'cause that's all we have. And maybe there's a little
hidden one back here, and you just can barely
see it, I don't know. Another one over here. Wherever you think they should be. Then we can take, very
gently, very gently, just bring some of that misty area right on down in there. Very soft though. And this is where you
really need that soft brush, if you're gonna pull this
misty all over the rocks, you really have to have a very soft brush so it doesn't cut the paint. There, we just let the back
of that stone disappear right into the mist. Alright. Make little watery sounds
when you're doing this. It helps. Let's take, I'm gonna dip the brush
into a small amount of the liquid clear, go
into the titanium white. The clear is in there only to
thin the paint a little bit. And maybe sneaking right out of here comes a little old watery falls, comes down and splashes. The water's beginning just to
creep out of the mist here. There it comes, a little more paint. Just let it sneak right out of there. We can take the knife, bunk, put another little stone here and there. Just the least little touch of highlight On some of these stones. Don't want much, too dark down here. I want to see that beautiful contrast. And then here, water comes, maybe it comes right over the top. Little splashes going on. I don't even know where this is going. Doesn't much matter at this point. There we go. Alright, we need to close
up the waterfall somehow. Need something on the sides, keep it contained so it doesn't just run right out of the painting. Maybe, yep, how about right there? Let's have, maybe there's a nice tree that lives right there. There he is. And there's another one. There we go. Little bit more color on the brush. Hope you can see those. Maybe I'll add the least
little touch of white to it. There you go, now you can see
some of those little shapes. Sometimes it gets so dark
here it's hard to see 'em. Maybe, yep, here's one. Little old details, some
of them I'm just making, just little pully down trees. Some of 'em I'm putting some detail in. Just up to you, whatever
you think should be there. Whatever you think should be there. There comes one. Boy, this one has quite
a view, doesn't it? This one leans right over
the old waterfall there. What a view. Gets plenty of moisture in its life. There. Maybe all kinds of little
things living right down here. Just wherever, wherever
you think they should be. Now then, I'm gonna create a little mist down at the base of this. So I'm just gonna take a
little of that lighter color, a little titanium white, tap in some nice, soft, misty areas. I'll show you why I want
that mist down there in just a second. Now then, let's go over
here on the other side of the old painting. We need something to
contain the other side. Maybe there's a big old stone
that lives right out here. It comes right down. Just comes right on down,
disappears right into that mist. We don't even know where it goes. Little light color, put
it right around there so it has something on top. There we go. I'm gonna grab just the
least little touch of it and pull it down, just enough so you can
see it a little bit. There we go, our little blender brush. I want to blend this right together so you can't tell where the mist stops and the rocks come together. Just blend it all together. Back to our little fan brush. There we go, a little white on it so it shows up against-- There we are. Just a few little, few little things that
live right in there. There. Something like that. Or maybe up here, let's
have, yep, a big tree. And he lives right here. There. Big old tree. I really hope you can see that. I'll put some highlights on. We'll put a little green
on it, maybe that'll help. These dark canvases, on TV,
sometimes don't show up as well as some of the other ones. There we go. But they are gorgeous. What's neat about these, if you're doing these in public, show 'em to people with the light on 'em, and then show 'em the same
painting without the light. It's unbelievable, the difference. Unbelievable. There we go. With the indication of a few
little trunks here and there but not much. Now then, let's take a
little bit of sap green, a little bit of, tiny
little bit of yellow. I want this to be very
dark, very, very dark. Very dark, little, little color on there. Okay, let's go up in here. Now then, maybe we can see 'em. I don't want 'em to get too bright though. That bothers me if it gets too bright. Just enough so they'll stand
out a little bit like so. Notice I say this is the last show in the 26th Joy of Painting series. My gosh, there's 300 and-- Geez, almost 340 shows now. I'm gonna put some over here, too. There, isn't that fantastic, though? That Joy of Painting has
produced that many shows? And made an old man's dream come true. You know, somebody asked me the other day, they said, "What should I
do if I hadn't got a chance "to see all the shows?" If you haven't got to see them, call your local station,
just let 'em know. And if you want this show to
continue, give 'em a call. Let 'em know that you like it. Because they only know if you tell 'em. There we are. Put a little green down here, too. What the heck, not much though. I really don't want too
much of this green in here. Just enough to sort of flavor it. There it is. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Let's go back to the fan brush. I'm gonna put some things right in here, some few more trees. Need a little lighter color. All we're doing here is
just playing with values, back and forth, making it a little
lighter, a little darker, back and forth. Put a little mist in here like that. There. Just a little misty area. Something about like
that, soft little area. Okay, now then. We can go back to our brush that has the black and the blue on it, or blue and black,
whichever your favorite is. We can go in here, and then
we'll put some little trees that live back in here, there they are. There's one. We'll put a little green on him, too, just to get him to stand
out a little better. But see those little misty
areas that you put in, that's the only thing
you have to separate. It makes your painting
look very, very dark, and very deep. Those little misty areas, they separate, they separate, they're your very good
friend, take care 'em. There. Alright. Our brush that has the green on it. We'll put the indication
of a few highlights on some of these trees. Dark, dark, darker down toward the base. There's one. Alright. Shoot, I'll tell you
what, I like big trees. Let's make a couple over
here in this misty area. In our world, there's
gonna be one right here. Now once again, see this mist right here? Watch, that's the only
thing that separates. But with that in there,
you can put a dark tree right up against it, and
it separates for you. There. And it makes your painting look so deep. So deep, and you've done
such a small amount to it. Sometime, maybe you can
just take the fan brush and make a little bush that
lives right here, it's okay. Something like that. There. Now we have the old fan brush that has the titanium white on it. Let's make some big decisions here. And we have to sort of decide where, if there there's gonna be
a river coming off here, we have to decide where it's gonna go. Maybe it's gonna go right on out, something like that. Doesn't much matter. Wherever you want it. Let's make the water shiny. But to make it shiny, just
pull down a little bit with a little touch of the white And then go across. That easy. Isn't that neat? It's one of the neatest
things that happens in this whole technique. There we go. All kinds of little things in there. Something like that. Tell you what, let me take
the little filbert brush here, dip it in some paint thinner, gonna make a thin paint. Got paint thinner going
right into blue and black. And I'm gonna go over
here and pull one side through a light color so
it's lighter on one side, so you get it against there, and dark on the other. And maybe in our world here, maybe there's just gobs of little stones that live right along in here, like so. Just wherever you want 'em. All kinds of happy little stones. There. Over here, here's a few more. And some of 'em are out here in the water. I hope you try this painting. It's one of the neatest little paintings. It is so easy, and it's a lot of fun. And when your friends
and neighbors see it, they won't believe you done it. And that truly is the joy of painting. When your paintings can
make other people happy, then you truly have experienced the joy that comes with painting. I want to thank you for
inviting me back into your home for another series of painting shows. The 27th series is
already under production, and I look forward to
seeing you very, very soon. Thank you again. From all of us here, happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (elevator music)
