- Hi, welcome back, certainly glad you could join us today. Thought today we'd just
do a little painting that's a lot of fun, and
I think you'll enjoy it. So let's start out and have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I got today. Today I have my regular old pre-stretched double-primed canvas up here, and I'm using 18 by 24, but you use whatever size is convenient. And I've taken a piece of contact paper or sticky back paper, and
I've just cut an oval in it. Might not be able to
see that too plain yet. We will by the end of the show. Just cut an oval in it,
stuck it on the canvas, then I've covered this
part with liquid white. So it's all wet and slick and ready to go. Let's start today with
our little two-inch brush. We'll go right into phthalo
blue, I like phthalo blue. Has such a beautiful, warm blue color. Get a little bit on the bristles, and let's go right up in here. And today, let's just
do a happy little sky, just one that I think you'll like. Just doing little crisscrosses, something about like that. And we'll come right on
down, oh, maybe right there. I'll tell you what, while
I got that blue going, I think we'll have some water in this one. We'll just go across
and put in some water. If you've painted with me before, you know I'm an absolute
fanatic for water, I love it. I think it's so gorgeous in paintings. There we are. And anything we don't want to be water, we just paint right
over it, doesn't matter. Now then, I'm gonna go back
into that phthalo blue, same identical color, but
this time I'm gonna tap, I'm tapping the bristles into a very, very small amount of color. See, there's not much paint
there, I'm just tapping. Now we'll go back up here. I wanna make an indication
of a big old fluffy cloud that just floats around up here in the sky and has fun all day. So I'll just tap it in. As I say, we're using the
identical same color, only darker. There. Just gonna tap in some basic shapes. Something about like that. And tell you what, let me
get the little blender brush. This is a new brush we
introduced in this series, but it'll get up here and you
can blend all these colors without tearing 'em up, see? You can go right over the
top of that, just blend it. Our regular brushes are
a little bit too firm to blend like this. So this is a super way of doing that. All right, fluff it up a little. You can just keep going over and over. Each time you blend it though, it gets a little softer
'til it finally will just, it'll just go away and leave you. All right, now then, maybe, maybe, maybe we'll take a little bit of
black, little bit of blue. And some white. I wanna color this very
close to the sky color. About like that, a little roll of paint, and let's go up in here. And maybe way back in the background, see, it just barely shows,
that's what I'm looking for. Back here somewhere, maybe
there's a big old mountain that lives way back in there somewhere. It's far away, far away. Just looking for a
little quiet one up here. And we'll take two-inch
brush and grab that. I want to blend it to soften it even more 'til it just about disappears
right up here in the sky. We can just blend right
over the entire mountain. This little rascal, when we get done, it'll just barely, barely show back there. Might not show at all,
and that's all right. Okay, now let's make a big mountain today. For that, let's take some black. Black, I wanna get alizarin crimson. A little more crimson, there were are. Black and alizarin crimson. Maybe a little bit of
prussian blue, not too much. I want this to have sort of
a lavendery flavor to it. Pull it out, get our
little roll of paint again. There we go, let's go up in here. Come right up in here,
let's make a big mountain. There it comes, lives right there. Let's have it come down. Just let your imagination go. I think we'll just, let's
do a big old crazy looking mountain today that give you a lot of practice using the knife,
and it's a lot of fun. Mountains are one of the best things going to give you practice with the knife. And if you make friends with this knife, there's just no limit to
what you can paint with it. I think I've mentioned in
some of the earlier series, we've done entire paintings
using nothing but the knife. Maybe we'll just have it
come right out like that. Whatever. Pull it down. (knife scraping) See, you can just change the
shape however you want it 'cause this is your world right here. Scrape off all the excess paint. Really get in there and scrape it off. Take a big brush. Pull that paint down. Once again, that removes excess paint, and it's continually blending
with the liquid white that's on the canvas, so your mountain automatically will get lighter and lighter down here toward the base. Right now it doesn't look like too much, but hopefully in a few minutes it'll get a little better looking. All right, let's mix up some color to go on our mountain. For that, today I think I'll use white and maybe a little black in it. Gray it down some, maybe a little more. There, just white with a
little bit of black in it. Something like that. Cut off our little roll of paint. Let's go back up here. Maybe today, let's have a mountain that maybe is highlighted
over here on this side. Just let that, shoom, flow right on down. Comes right up here, shoom, there. Big old mountain that lives way back here. Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah, let's have it come right down. I know, let's have it come
right on out here, I don't care. When you're doing your
painting, you decide where your mountain
lives, what it looks like, how the angles are, where the highlights and the shadows are. It's totally and completely up to you. I'll mix up a little more. We'll take some white, little bit of the prussian blue, and put some black in
there to dull it down. Don't wanna over mix it. I'm even gonna put a little brown into it, a little dark sienna, a little van dyke. So see how marbled the color is, though? I wanna keep that, 'cause that's right there
in that roll of paint. And with that, we can come up here and we can begin adding
in a few little shadows. Just a few little shadows,
they live right in here. There, just little sneaky things. Pick up a little bit of the dark sienna. Just let it bounce right along in here like you can see some
of the mountain color. There we go. Just sorta let these little things play and bounce across here very gently. I'm going back to the solid dark color that I used to make the mountain. And we'll put a little bit
of that here and there. See, that makes deep, dark areas in there. Just sort of separates everything. Just a few of 'em here and there. There, I'm going over in here, put a few little things to make that look very deep, dark. Little area in between there. Maybe, shoot, I tell you what, maybe there's a little
peak in here, I don't know. Come right along with a little bit of the highlight color, drop that in, then we could begin playing. But I just want another little projection that lives right out there. That easy. Just to make it stand out, look rough and ragged. All right, maybe where you
wanna put little dark areas. And at home, take your time
and just really get in here and play and put all
these little things in. You'll be amazed at the kind of things that you can create in your world. Just let 'em happen, let 'em happen. There, just little things
that live in there. Let some of these dark
colors just play through. Mm, boy, a mountain climber
would have a rough time on that one, even. Okay, now then, I wanna
create a misty effect (brush banging) down at the base of that. Let's get a clean brush. That one's not quite clean enough. And just begin tapping. There, then gently,
gently, gently lift upward. Now then, I'll go right into, let's get a little touch of the sap green, a little bit of that mountain color. I'm just gonna mix 'em
together on the brush here. Just looking for some various colors. Oh, that's right there. Let's go up in here. We'll put some little things right in here that eventually, hopefully will look like little trees that go right
up the side of the mountain. 'Cause we're gonna lift 'em upward, just give 'em a little upward lift. There, see 'em? All kinds of little
things that live in there. Just pop 'em up. That easy. Just load a little more
paint there, pop these up. But see all the different planes
that you can make in there? Look at there, you'd have to track all the way up here to get
clean up that mountain. Whew, if we keep going here, we're gonna have Mount McKinley. I used to live not far
from Mount McKinley. It's one of the most
gorgeous places in the world. Let's wash the old brush. Shake it off. (brush banging) (chuckles) Just beat the devil out of it. All right, today maybe I'll
use a little round brush. And let's go in, we'll use a little bit of that mountain color,
we'll put a little bit of sap green with it, be right back. I'm gonna grab a little white over here. Ooh, that's a nice color. Little more green into it though. All right, okay, let's go up in here. Maybe in our world's a little footy hill that lives right here. Like so, I don't know where it goes, don't know that we even
care at this point. It goes wherever you want it to go. Then grab this and lift it up. See there, just another layer. Now I wanna create mist
at the bottom of this, so I'll take a two-inch brush, just a clean two-inch brush, tap it. That'll soften the bottom of it, make it very, very soft. (brush tapping) Okay, and maybe let's have something a little darker in there now. Let's have, yeah, maybe some little bushes that
live right in here. I want to put a dark
area against the light. Still using the little small round brush. Just put the indication
of some little things that live way, way back
in the distance, far away. Far away, there. Then I'm gonna go back,
and once again, mist this. Just misting the base of it though. And this little misty area,
as you can see above there, that becomes your separator. That separates the different
planes in your painting or the different layers. I'm gonna add a little
bit of cadmium yellow to the same color that
I did the back one with and maybe put another layer in. A little yellow ochre, too. There, that's much better,
it stands out better now. See, just lift it up. But very gently, very gently. And that'll give us all
kinds of little things that live way back in there. Lightly, lightly. Just barely, barely touching. Let's see here, let's take
a little bit of green, a little bit of that black into it. Let's just put something here. See, we'll just lay a little color on. And you can just take a
fan brush and lift it up. Look like little trees live way back here. Just lay a little thick color on. See, pop it up. That easy. Get a little touch of the liquid white, pull it out flat. A little bit of that same color, that greenish color that
we were using before, put it in the liquid white. Then I get a little bit
on the edge of the knife, and we can go right up in here and make it look like little grassy banks right along in there, something like that. Okay, back to old brush that has all those colors on it we used, let me add a little more. And while we have this
here, let's pull that down. Just make a happy little
reflection lives right out here. See, I probably should've done this before I put the water line in. Would've made it easier. But we can just go right
back and put it in again. It's easy to do. 'Cause as you know, we
don't make any mistakes. (chuckles) There we are. Okay, good. Now then, maybe... Let's see what we got going. I gotta clean off a spot to work. Even with a palette this big, I run out of room sometime. Let's take some black, prussian blue, alizarin crimson, put a
little sap green in it. Okay, maybe a little more green. Let me wipe off the old knife. We'll go in here with the, I'm using a number three fan brush today. Okay, let's go up in here. Maybe in our world there lives a few little evergreen
trees right in here. Something about like that. Give him a little friend
that lives there with him. You know me, I think everybody
should have a little friend. There we go. Shoot, why don't I have another one? There, little rascals live everywhere. Okay, find my brush there, I
got too many brushes going. Maybe right in front of here we'll put another little layer. That'll help push those trees
back a little bit farther. Each layer causes more and more depth in your painting, and it
just gets deeper and deeper. Okay, now then, time
for some big decisions. I'm gonna find a bigger fan brush 'cause it's a little bit faster. I'll go back into that same tree color. I'm gonna make another tree. That was so much fun. Load it full of color, lot of paint. Let's go up in here. Maybe, you're right, there it is. There he lives, little
tree lives right there. Hey, that's getting to
be a pretty big tree. That's all right, it's our world. We can make a tree any size we want it. Any size we want it. Fact, let's make one even bigger. There, use just the corner of the brush, and as you work down,
push harder and harder, forcing the bristles to bend. We'll separate 'em with highlights. Right now, we're just looking for basic shapes, that's all. Just take that same color,
little round brush here. And maybe there's a little peninsula that sticks right out like that. And if we had all that,
we'd need a reflection. So we might as well just drop it in while we got the old brush going. There we are. Take a two-inch brush,
grab that, pull it down. Instant reflections, that easy. Let's see here, here's
on that's not too dirty. (chuckles) Take a little bit of yellow,
little bit of sap green, yellow ochre, indian yellow. And occasionally, I'll probably hit a little bit of the bright red, okay? Tap a little color on the brush. And maybe up in here, we'll
just have a few little highlights right in there. Let me load a little more color on here so it shows up a little stronger. There we go, that's nice. That's nice, maybe just make a decision. See there, there's a little bush that has little yellow flowers on it. And that's just one of
those happy accidents. It works sometime, there, see? We have all kinds of
little things out here. Take a little bit of van dyke brown. Let's just come in here
and put in the indication of a little land. A little touch of brown and white. Come right back, put in a little bit of... highlight on there. We'll take some liquid white, and with that, just cut in indication of a little water line, something like so. Maybe I'm gonna get the small knife. I'm gonna do, maybe come right up in here. Maybe there's some
little stones, see here? Live right out here in the water. Just some happy little stones. Some of that little highlight color. Just go across like that. There we are, little
touch of the liquid white. Put some water lines
around those little stones. Look at there, there they come. There they are. We'll get the old two-inch brush here. Maybe, yep, let's have some nice, big bushy things that live right up in here. There, careful, I don't wanna cover up my little stones, I like 'em. Looks like a little
way to go across there. All kinds of little things. Just like that. Maybe that comes all the
way up there, I don't know. It's up to you. You make the big decisions, there. Back to my brush that
has the greens on it. Let's come right in here, put the indication of all kinds of little highlights on there. Vary your colors. A little yellow ochre I added right there. Ooh, nice one, nice one. Don't kill all those dark areas, though. Sometimes it gets good
and you get carried away and you kill all those little dark areas. That's what makes your painting deep. Save those, treasure them. They're your best friends
when you're painting. Your absolute best
friends, take care of 'em. Take care of 'em, 'cause
you always have to take care of your friends. There we go. When Annette and I were
traveling for many years, I don't travel and teach
much anymore, I got too old. We have too many
instructors that do it now. But Annette and I traveled for many years, and we met some of the
most fantastic people in the whole world. I still keep in touch with a lot of 'em after all these years. Now, maybe we'll have
some more water down here. So we just grab this, choo, choo, choo, pull it down, and go across. Look at there, see? (chuckles) You just decide
where you think water should be and drop it in. We'll come back in here, put us in a little water line. And we could take a small knife, put a few rocks here and there. There's a rock. Little bit of highlight on our rock. Shoot, maybe pull that
over a little, there. Little more of the liquid white. All right. Come right along like that. This painting has, whew, it's got a lot of planes in it. It just goes back forever. But that's good, I like that in paintings. Let's put a little tree trunk in here. A little brown, a little white. Okay, find our fan brush,
put some green on it. And we'll come back in here. Put a few highlights on
our little evergreen tree so it stands out, don't put
a whole bunch of highlights 'cause evergreens are
normally pretty dark anyway. Wanna keep 'em dark. Especially down toward the base, want 'em to get darker and darker, darker down toward the base. Now then, let's take bright red, oh, dark sienna, van dyke brown. Making sort of a reddish brown color here. Okay, maybe in our world,
let's go up here. (chuckles) This is your bravery test. In our world, there lives,
boy, there does now, a big old tree, hangs right
off the side of this canvas. I'm just putting in some base color so that our lighter color will show. Maybe he lives right there. I know, I know, I know,
I know, let's get crazy. Maybe there's another tree over here. There, I know that's scary after you worked so hard
to put these things in, then you get up here and
some fuzzy haired crazy guy tells you to (chuckles)
drop a big old tree in. I know that's scary. And in your world, if you
don't wanna put this tree in, you don't put it in, you don't put it in. But if you want to, it's a lot of fun. Let's see here. I'm gonna take a little bit of brown. A little brown, little
brown, little brown. Right there on the fan brush. Put a little white on one side, then go shoo. Gotta have some kind of tree trunk to hold all that up. Like that. On the other side here,maybe
this is and old wiggly tree. There we go, take our liner brush, a little bit of that same brown color. And we can put an arm or two out here, wherever you think these
old tree limbs should be, up to you, totally and
completely up to you. Here we go, there's some over here. Maybe here's one that no leaves are on it. It's sort of a naked one. There. All right, we can come back, and we'll go right into yellow ochre and bright red mixed
together, whew, nice color. And let's put, yeah, isn't that great? Let's put some leaves
up here on these trees just using the corner of
the old brush, just like so. Just like so. If you have trouble making this stick, add a little bit of paint thinner. There we are. A few on the other side. Look at that, isn't that fantastic? I've painted thousands and
thousands of paintings, and it still gets me
excited to see this work. I think it's a moment of truth. Let's bring the camera
up here, and let's take the contact paper off
and see what we've got. (ripping) Look at there, isn't that something? I think we can sign this one. Take a little of the paint thinner, a little bit of bright
red, and we'll sign it. Really hope you've enjoyed it. This is quite a nice little painting. Give you a lot of practice
with all the equipment. I think you'll enjoy it. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. (light music)
