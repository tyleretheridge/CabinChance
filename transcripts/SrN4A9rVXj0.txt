- Hey. Welcome back. Certainly glad your could join us today. Today I thought we would
do the little painting that you had seen at the
beginning of the show. The one that's got the little character that walks in the snow. I'll show you how that one was done. But first let's start out and
and them run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I got done up here. I started with a regular
old 18 by 24 inch canvas but you can use whatever
size is convenient. Took a piece of contact paper and I just cut a shape out that sort of, in my mind, resembles a window. That's all. Then we took some masking tape and just made a couple of little
doers with masking tape up and down like that. We've covered the entire thing
then with a very thin coat of liquid white just to make it wet. And it's ready to go. So, let's just have some fun today. Let's start out today with a - Let's start with a bit
of the midnight black. Just a small amount on
the old two inch brush and a little Prussian blue. Just mix them together on the brush. It doesn't matter. Little of each. Alright, and let's go right up here. And we'll start up in here, just making our normal
little criss-cross strokes. Little Xs. And just paint right over
the top of the masking tape and everything. Just paint right over it
like it's not even there. Cause if you are looking out the window the little cross members
in the window would be in front of what you are seeing anyway. So just paint it on. Maybe a little bit in here. Wherever. Wherever. There. A little more of that color. We'll put a little up in here. Like so. There. Just make the little Xs though and it'll blend with the liquid
white that's on the canvas and automatically your color
will just blend together. There we are. Something about like that. Now then. We can just blend that. See there are spots that are
lighter than other spots. And we leave those in there intentionally. And you could go back with
a little titanium white if you wanted to and
brighten those little spots. In fact, i'll tell you why not
wash the brush and do that. Just to show you. But you can make those little spots as bright as you want them. Just shake off the brush and beat the devil out of it. Let's take just a little bit of white. Maybe, right up in here we
want a little brighter area. It's up to you. And you can just take
the white and drop it in. Maybe even one up in here. But that's all there is to it. Ok. Now this won't be an exact duplicate of what you see at the
opening of the show. But it'll certainly show
you how that one was made. Alright. Now, let's take - Use that same old color.
It's working pretty good. Black. Prussian blue and white. And we'll just mix them together. Mix them together. I'm going to make a light blue color here. Something that's getting
pretty close right there. You just sort of mix it until
it's the flavor that you like. And I sort of like that. So let's wipe off the old knife. Think I'll grab number three fan brush, since that's what I picked up. Load it full of paint. And let's go right up here. We have a little tree that's far away. So touch. Now this time we are going to push upwards sometimes we push down with the brush to make little evergreens. Today, I'm going to push upwards. Go right over the masking tape. Just like it wasn't even there. Don't worry about it. Don't even worry about it. Something about like that. Now then, And there's one right there. We just put these little trees wherever you think they
should live in your world. There we go. I like making little trees like this. They're a lot of fun. But just push upward. You're making the bristles bend
toward the top of the tree. There we are. Something about like that. Push in some little bushy things. Same basic way. We're just pushing upward with the brush. Ok. And that's basically
how we made the little background trees. You could take the knife
and you could put a little stick or twig. Maybe there's a little tree that's maybe not doing so well. Maybe doesn't even have any leaves on him. Just an old stalk sticking out there. Maybe there's a couple
of them. I don't know. Wherever you think they should be. Just just them in that easy. But you want these just a
little bit darker than the sky. Don't get too crazy. Now then, Let's take that color and
we'll just lay it over here for the time being. Might use it later. Who knows? Prussian blue, black, crimson. Throw a little alizarin crimson in there. We'll mix us up a pile of dark color. We're going to make some
dark trees later on, so we'll have that ready. Now then, since this is a winter scene we had snow in it. Cause I remembered the little guy, he walked around in the snow back here. Now, believe it or not,
the little guy was me too. It's hard to see. Alright. Now let's have
a little bit of snow right here. See there. That easy. Just pull it across. Snow is one of the easiest things to paint in this technique. There we are. There we are. That's simple. Old two inch brush will
do it in a heartbeat. Ok. Let's build a bigger tree and for that I'm going to get a bigger brush. I'm going to go to number 6, but you could continue
to use number three. It doesn't matter. Just a little faster with this one. Alright, we have another
tree in our world. There it is right there. Same thing though. I want to give it an upward push. There. It's got some upstanding limbs in here. There we go. This one is very dark. Pure color. There. Same color as the other one but without the white. Minus the white, that's all. And maybe it comes down to about there. Who knows. Who knows. Alright. Take the knife, I'll be scratching a little
indication of a trunk in there. I have several fan brushes going. So I'm going to take another
one and put some liquid white, and some titanium white
and mix them together. Liquid white is in there
only to make the paint a little thinner. Cause you know our golden rule, thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Alright, and we'll go up in here and with this phthylo blue and white we'll just put the
indiction of some highlights on this little tree. Little sparklers. That will make that rascal stand out. There. I'm going to grab a one inch brush and use some of that dark color and we have a little bush live right here. There he comes. Just push in a basic shape. That's all we're looking for here. Just a very basic little shape. About like that. See? But leave some of
that background in there. It helps create the illusion
of depth and distance in the painting. And we'll dip the brush
in the liquid white and pull it in one direction. One direction. To load it. Liquid white and through
the titanium white in one direction. Look at the end of the
brush. A lot of paint on it. Probably the biggest mistake
made is not enough paint. Let's go up here. Now with that, we can come up in here and we can put some
little snow covered bushes right under that tree. There. If you have trouble making that stick add the least little touch
of liquid white to it. There we are. Cause it needs to be thinner
than what's on the canvas. If the thinnest paint is on your canvas, it'll come off and go on your brush. If the paint on the canvas
is thinner than the brush. It's the most important. You want the paint on
your brush to be thinner than what's already on
the canvas, that way, the canvas will literally
pull the paint off. It'll take what it needs, just like a tax man. There we go. Come right in here, and we'll pull that down. Create a whole other
plane in this painting just by doing that. Intentionally grab a
little bit of that blue. It makes gorgeous little
shadows automatically. Automatically. There. Alright. Now, are you ready for a big tree? We'll just use the old fan brush. Load it full of the dark, dark color. Let's go up in here. Make a decision. Might as well just do it. Might as well just do it. An start pushing upward. We're going to create a monster tree here. A big tree. There he comes. Just keep pushing up. Think about individual limbs and branches, little arms on the tree. Little squirrels have
to have a place to go. In the wintertime, they get sort of cold. They have to go up here and
build themselves a nest. Sort of take life easy. There we are. Something about like that. That's a big tree. I wasn't kidding. I forgot how big that
tree was in that painting. But isn't that little opening neat with the little guy walking back there? That little opening is
the idea of one of my very good friends here at
the station, Gerry Morton, who is one of the engineers
that puts all of this together. He comes up with those. There we are. I don't know where he
gets all of his ideas but they are neat. I'm going to put another one right here. Alright. I like that little painter guy. For many years I wanted to
take that little painter guy and do a show with him. Let him do all kinds of things. And maybe, in the very near future, we can do something like that. I've had some fantastic people ask us to come to Branson, Missouri and do a little show with the painter man. So, maybe we'll do that. If you're there, stop by and say hello. I'd love to talk to you. Just take into pulling
that out, like that. And off we'll go. There. Now then, find my little brush that's
got the phthalo blue on it. A little phthalo blue, a little white, a little liquid white. You know that we want it
thinner so it'll stick on there. Phthalo blue, titanium
white, liquid white. See? Brush is loaded both sides. Let's go up here and we'll
come right into here. I use the phthalo blue because we use prussian blue in the sky
and I want it to stand out. And it sort of makes evergreens
look like blue spruce trees, which I love. When I lived in Alaska,
I had a huge blue spruce that lived in my front yard. Gorgeous tree. Absolutely one of God's
most beautiful creations. There we are. Darker, darker, darker down
here toward the bottom. Less and less. And this one back here in the back, I don't want a whole bunch. It's too far back. Don't want him to be really
important in this painting. Quiet little tree. There we are. Alright. Now then, in our little painting that
you saw at the beginning, we had a couple of huge birch trees. So let's do those. We'll take midnight black, and
just a little blue in there but it's mostly black. Mostly midnight black. Let's put a little Van
Dyke brown in it too. About like that. Pull it out flat. Cut across and get a little roll of paint. There you can see it. Right under the edge of the knife. Ok, this really is your bravery test. We're going to start way down here and we're just going to begin working up right across the tape. Right across everything. Just let this tree go all
the way out of the top. That's a big tree. That was serious, wasn't it? It is a big tree. But they're a lot of fun to make. And if you don't want
the tree in your world to be quite that big,
make it a little smaller. It's totally and completely up to you. Any size you want him to be. Alright I like big trees because they
reach right up to the sky. Nearly touch the sun. Alright, well not quite. If I remember, somebody
said the sun was about 93 million miles away. I guess a tree is not quite that tall. But he's a big tree. Oh right through my evergreen,
but we know he's back there. We know he's back there. And we learned how to paint
him, so it's not wasted. Anytime you learn, it's
not a wasted effort. There. And I like to paint birch trees, and other kind of trees too. When the paint is dry you
can literally feel the bark, just like a real tree. Alright. Now, let's got back to our titanium white. I'm just going to use
straight titanium white. And I want to touch and sort of give it a, I'm exaggerating, a round pull. Touch, and sort of give it a - and it makes the tree look round. And those little square
trees, they're sort of rare. You need to make your tree
have a round look to it. It would be nice if they
came in square, wouldn't it? You could just cut two
by fours off of them without even running
them through the mill. There we are. Big old birch tree. There. And this one. Now I've decided this one is in the front. So we'll do him last. Always do the thing that, in your mind, is the farthest away. And then work forward, forward, forward. There. These are fun. I like to make old birch trees. When I lived in Alaska, I
used to do a lot of paintings for the tourists there. And they always wanted birch
trees and northern lights. Of course that's sort of what
Alaska is noted for I guess. And they were a lot of
fun to paint anyway, so I don't mind. There. A little dark in there. About like that. And you can just keep
playing back and forth and building this up until
it gets to any degree of thickness or color that you want. There. Of course you can piddle it to death too. Alright. Let's take our liner brush, paint thinner. Put quite a bit of paint thinner up here. And let's make some thin
paint and we'll paint some arms on these little trees. Gotta have an arm on him. But it doesn't have any leaves. It got too cold. The leaves chickened out and
they went south for the winter. There we are. But there, just, the paint thinner will allow you to flow. The paint will flow
right off the bristles. Right onto the canvas. If you have trouble making it flow, add a little more paint thinner. This one seems to be working pretty good so we'll just keep on going with it. There we are. Big old arm. We can come back and put
a little highlight on it, maybe a little snow. But just pretend that the
tape is not even there. Just let the branches grow
the way they would grow if the tape wasn't there. Don't worry about it. When we pull that off, it'll
make it look realistic. Alright. See? And this is where I get letters
from people and they say "Bob, but I don't think I can paint. I've got a little nervous
twitch in my hand." This is your painting. Because if you have a
little nervous twitch it really works better
doing these tree branches. I have youngsters in their
nineties who write me and tell me that they never believed
that they could paint. And they're doing it. And they're doing it everyday. It's fantastic to hear success stories. There we are. So the tree over here says,
"he needs a limb too." Now this tree, we
decided was in the front. So his arm will go right over
the top of the other one. So we'll just start him right here. and he'll go distinctly over, that makes him look
like he's in the front. There. I don't want him to get angry at us. Nothing worse than a mad tree. Alright. And maybe here's one that goes off that way. We don't know where it goes. Don't know that it even matters
in this particular painting. You could just put arms
wherever you want them. And I'm going to clean the brush and just dip it into a little
bit of the liquid white. This is just liquid white. And maybe we can come back here and there and there and here. Just put the indication
that there's a little snow sitting in some of these places on here. Something about like that. But isn't that neat? It's all there is to it. Ok and with that, that gives
us a pretty good little tree. Down here at the bottom grab a fan brush. Put a little liquid white on my brush. Titanium white. Let's go down in here,
grab a little of the color and we'll put a little
snow right down there. There we got a little of that color. I want the color in there for a shadow. Something about like that. Ok. I can pop in a little
indication of a little bush. See? that easy. Alright. Now then. Over here, we had a little fence. So for that, I'm going to
take a little Van Dyke, a little dark sand and mix them together. And right here, just lives what remains of a little old fence. It's about gone. There. Something about like that. Come back with our one inch brush. Let's put a little brush on his foot. Just a little bush lives down in here. Something like that. Liquid white. And we'll go through titanium white, same as we did before, maybe
a little blue on that one. Cause there's white behind it, we need to separate with just
a little phthalo blue on it. A little snow-covered
bush lives right there. Little bit of the titanium
white to pull that out. Isn't that easy? Shoot, we got that rascal in there. Now, while I have liquid
white and titanium white mixed together, I wanna put the indication if you're looking out the
window, on the old window supports here, there's a little snow that has just collected in here. This is a gorgeous painting to
give as a christmas present. See? You can just put it
on right there like that. We'll have some up here. Go right over the tree branches because this would be right up front. There. But this paint is a little thinner. It's got liquid white in it. And maybe it's on all of them here. And here's one right here. Let's put a little bit right in there. Little more of the liquid white. Brighten that one up a
little bit so it shows. Alright. Even a little down here on the bottom. What the heck. Just a tiny bit. Something about like so. Alright. Now let's take us a script liner brush, dip it in a little paint thinner, and we can go around here
and there and there and here put in a few little sticks and twigs. Just little things that look
like little finished details in your painting. There. See? just a happy little old
stick that lives out there. And some little weeds around the fence. Shoot. Maybe there's still
even an indication of a little little wire hanging on some of those. Not much. Tell you what, I'm
going to take some white and a little touch of dark sand. A little white and a little dark sand. Cut off a little roll of paint. Let's go right up in here. And let's just highlight
this so it stands out a little bit more. Oh yeah. That's much better. Sort of rest in there.
we want it to pop out. There we go. Now, it looks more like an old fence. Now I can go back and put a few more little sticks and twigs in there. Maybe theres one down here. A wiggly one. Let your hand just sort of
jerk around a little bit. Make all them little
weird sticks and things because they're always there. They sort of stick up through the snow, wherever you want them to be. We got s second lift here. Maybe I'll put just a little
more detail on some of these limbs because I like to have a lot of little sticks and twigs on my - There we are. That's what makes it interesting. If you try this painting,
take your time and do a photograph and send it to us. I would love to see what you're doing and every so often we put them together and put them on a little board show them on TV so you can see what people
all over the country are doing with this. There are some that are
fantastic and some that are better than that. So just it's wonderful that
people have so much success in painting. There. Alright. Ok. We're about to get this
little devil finished here. Just figure out where you
want little sticks and twigs. Any old where. There's some. Right in there. Ok. I think we're about to the point where we can take the old contact paper off and see what we got here. So bring the camera up here. And pull this off. Isn't that fantastic? It does look like you're
looking out a window. But as I say, it's a very
simple little painting that you can do. Try it because I really think that
you're going to enjoy this one. Sort of different. Makes a beautiful gift to give to friends and relatives. Especially, as I mentioned
earlier, around christmas time. And no one appreciates a gift
more than one that you produce with your own hand. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting. God bless my friend. [Music]
