hey welcome back certainly glad you could join me today today I thought we'd paint a little animated opening that's a little picture you see at the beginning of each show and it just sort of happens and I'll show you how that picture was made now don't takes a few minutes to paint it takes a lot of fantastic people a long time to animate it so I tell you what let's start out having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let me tell you what I've done up here have my standard old pre-stretch canvas up here and I've covered it with a thin even coat of the liquid white so it's all ready to go so let's go today we'll start off with the big brush big old two inch brush I'm gonna go into a small amount of alizarin crimson and you need very little color here just want to put a little pinkish glow in the sky just a little okay now then let's go right up in here and we just makes a little crisscross strokes it will just lay in a happy little sky just like so there we go that's all there is to it well I hope there is now be careful when you put this on because we don't want to set this guy on fire we just want to give it a little glow make it warm there okay another well I have that going there's a hair I'll just knock it off I have that on the brush I had a little touch more same way just tap the brush into a small small amount and then put a little touch right here will be no there's gonna be some water and Crimson's not a very strong color so it doesn't matter where we put it if we don't like it we can cover it up easy okay now then we had some big clouds it was floating around the sky we just mixed with a brush II will go back into crimson I reached out here and get the least little touch of phthalo blue so we have alizarin crimson and phthalo blue make it a lavender color proportionately much more crimson in blue much much more okay let's go back up here now then we're just sort of using little circular strokes we just sort of danced in some some little cloud shapes little cloud shapes let me get a little more color on my brush there and use use a round go round round round my cat and makes beautiful little cloud things just sort of happen automatically you don't have to worry about it that the brushwork shoot this is this is a lazy man's way of painting here there we go and some little things down in here wherever we want them there maybe up in here now this will not be an exact duplicate of what we did for the animated opening but it'll be close enough that you can see exactly how it was made there we go Nicole cloud justice or now hangs right out here and plays around all we're doing is just filling in some color and by mixing these colors on the brush you could have you get a multitude of variations that happen in here that would be very difficult to do if you were just adding these two colors on all kinds of things just happen automatically and you don't even have to worry about it to think about it it just happens just let it go very quickly with a little practice you learn to use anything it happens here and that's when it's really fun okay and we'll wash the brush and we wash our brush you would just order this thinner shake it off and cover the whole studio you know I've made such a mess in here they're moving to a new studio there they've got the walls covered here all the camera people are covered okay now with a clean dry brush all I'm doing is just blending this out some just blend it out okay now I will take a little bit more of the color the same blue and crimson and and we'll put a little touch where we want ahead to emphasize a darker cloud want to stand out there just here and there maybe there's a little dark or something makes your sky a little stronger a little more interesting okay now while I have that color on my brush the phthalo blue and alizarin crimson wheel add just a little bit more and let's go down here for our waters gonna be and we can put in a little bit of water pull from the outside again so you have these little feathered edges here it's their not harsh strong edges it's easier to blend those out okay either side a little bit over here as I mentioned earlier this crimson that you have in the center will cover up very easy so be careful it'll go away and leave you there okay not very lightly we can just blend this together and that easy we have a happiness car and water in just a couple of minutes now here all I'm doing is just blending all this together that's a super way to make a very effective little sky now let's go let's go back into that same color lizard crimson phthalo blue just mix it right on the brush it's the easiest way and let's begin putting in some little shapes here for some little trees and stuff that live in the background I like this to be a little darker now so it stands out using just a corner of the brush we can just begin tapping in all kinds a little just little basic shapes you have to make big decisions now where is your tree how big is he does he live here does he live there or do you want it wherever you want him that's exactly the right place for him to be is he tall short okay there he goes there's a big one right there there see just sort of visualize this in your mind and drop it off that's all you have to do anything that your mind can see you can paint there okay maybe maybe there's another tree here as I mentioned earlier this will not be an exact duplicate of what was on the beginning of the show but it's certainly for sure you have was made certainly will show you that let's see here a little more color blue buzzard crimson let's go right in if you want to add a little black to that I want to start getting a little darker so it makes the shadows in there so we have crimson blue and then a little bit of a midnight black and a big tree here so we can begin putting that in there just like were you where you want the limbs to hang there's gonna be some big overhanging limbs there there they come and one there wherever you want okay and already see we have the whole background in all of our basic shapes and it only takes a second alright now you have to make a big decision or do you want reflections all you have to do grab it because the canvas is with the paint will slide the liquid whites under there it allows the paint to move just pull it straight down straight down like that and then go across lightly and we have instant reflexes weren't fantastic bad easy now let's use the liner brush we will dip it into some paint thinner and then go right into a little bit of Van Dyck Brown I want this to be very thin like ink just straight Van Dyke Brown turn the brush in there and pull it that brings it to a beautiful sharp point liner brush has very long bristles so it holds a lot of paint now we can come right up in here and let's just begin putting in the indication of some little tree trunks here and there they're seeing okay maybe there's a few little things that stick out here and there wherever you want them these are fun to make and if you have trouble making your paint flow add some paint thinner just means your paints not quite thin enough the paint's that we use are very very firm very dry it allows us to paint over the top of them others still wet if you start with a thin paint you're in gonna be an agony City gonna be upset with me very dry firm paint it's most most important there we are wherever you want just a few little sticks and twigs well let's use the one-inch brush today again putting some some highlights on some of those you can go right into a little bit of the yellow this is just CAD yellow reach up here be right back wait only there we are a little bit of SAP green add it to it now tap the brush tap it so you give it a little push there we are now let's go up here begin deciding where the leaves are on these trees all the little bright things just sort of touch it tap gently downward and begin building form and shape into your tree don't just hit these at random think about little limbs at live in here and all the little places the birds are gonna set on add little yellow ochre little Indian yellow here and there there we go she just makes some of the most fantastic little trees and bushes just using the corner of the brush 2 inch brush works over very well also okay there we are one over here don't this one left out okay and they only had a big one it's we appear in the sky Janus begin reading all kinds of little patterns and on his arms there there okay now I'm gonna add a little more SAP green to my color when I begin getting a little darker and maybe down in here we're beginning to pick up some little individual bushes I made this little darker because there's shadows down here there we go the trees cause shadows to be here so these shouldn't be quite as bright down here near the lights go to zing through and you might have one that shines overall a little bit darker there we go maybe over here I'll have a few but just sort of pick them out make determinations where you think they'd live and drop them in there we're okay shoot let's get crazy I'm gonna take some black some Prussian blue we'll use some Van Dyke Brown little salad green little crimson sort of mix it all together can we clean my knife off here and grab a fan brush there we go I'm gonna load the fan brush full of color a lot of paint at both sides will make up the little evergreens that were back here we'll have one that lives right there to start with the line use the corner of the brush you just sort of go back and forth back and forth there that little evergreen would just jump right out there okay let's have one right there hey there they hide that fresh all you have to do is just push him out let's go we over an end here and we'll put in a little evergreen or two over here there he is we'll give him a little friend trees need friends too okay now let's take a one inch brush pull it through that same color and let's begin putting in some dark backgrounds here for some bushes you need the dark so the light will show it's the only reason we're putting this in here just sober just so the light color will show if you put light against light you have nothing or dark against start you have absolutely nothing there you know then one inch brush and I'm going to dip it into a small amount of the liquid white and I dip it into the liquid white only to thin the paint only to thin it pull this in one direction a little lot of color into the bristles now then I want these to Sparkle want them to stand out look at that hmm here we're pushing upward with a brush there's a lot of paint so all you have to do is give it a gentle little push and you can just make beautiful beautiful little bushes back here that sometimes I get a lot of letters people have problems making this work usually the problem is that there's not enough paint in the bristles and you have to push too hard and in it sort of mushiya said it's a new word I just made up and do one Bush at a time each one of these is an individual treating as such there we go now then I'm gonna go back to my lavender color just a little blue and little crimson and underneath here we're gonna begin building some some landmasses we need a place for a little cabin to sit so all we do is add in a little bit of color once again we're putting in dark so our light will show anything it hangs down here you just pull it down turn it into a reflection look at that super instant reflections and then I won't grab another yeah there's a we use a two inch brush today what the heck we'll go right into the SAP green CAD yellow little yellow ocher just sort of mix these colors on the brush now then let's begin putting in some little grassy areas be nice place back here for the little cabin to sit there see their sound via what you can do with a big old brush all we're doing here is just tapping just tapping creates all those nice soft little grassy areas and I'm varying the colors between all the yellows and every once in a while the least little touch of the bright red don't need much of that but it gives it a nice orangie flavor once in a while sparkles it up there fantastic knew you could do it came out it let's have some fun I want to start working on my little cabin so come right up in here I'll scrape in a few little sticks stuff with a clean knife now then decide where your cabins gonna live and I think we'll have this one right about here take the knife scrape out a basic shape that's just about the easiest way I have found to lay out a cabin all you have to do is just sort of scrape out where you think he'll live and at this point you're still not committed you could still change your mind here and nope no problem then we'll take some Van Dyke Brown and we can begin just block any min and that's all we're doing here we're just applying color we're still not committed we could change your mind at this point if we wanted to see down the side down the front just blocking in color it's all once again we're putting his dark in so we put a lighter color on it it'll stand out okay now listen for the roof we'll use some red dark Sienna put a little yellow ochre in it - what the heck there may be a touch of white hmm nice color looks good enough to eat now a little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife just barely touching just sort of let it bounce right down the roof just blew bleep lutely see it's bear to touch make it look old like it's had a rough time Avedon at the least a little bit of white on my knife and just sort of highlight the edges so they stand out nice now you can see that rascal know a little the little knife um take some white and midnight black white and black on the small knife I'm looking for a gray color just pull it out and once again our little roll of paint even though we're using the small knife still that little roll of paint now just barely touching pull down a little bit on the other side there now toward the back of the cabin and my mind is gonna be less light hitting over here so I'm gonna add a little more black to my color to darken it and come right there that easy you can do anything on this canvas I have a little little line right across there and maybe here and there there's some little things just adds a little interest to your cabin give him a window to right here use a small edge of the small knife see there's one window there's another window that we can take the knife and we can do a cabin ectomy mm that's where we just cut it off so it looks right now back to my two inch brush a little bit of the grass color we can put some grass red around his foot sorry bring him all together be nice it was that easy to to have a lawn in your yard now there was a little little fence out here so just take an industry's little bit of liquid white on the liner brush see just there goes our little fence and it easy little more put some rails across it yeah we have a little white fence out here maybe watch here you put one up here and go that way make us sound again go around the corner I sneaky huh okay Navin I'm a big brush get a little more the lavender color just a little blue lettering crimson tapping into this brush okay now then let's begin working on some land masses here I have to make some big decisions I'm here was one camera right out like yeah there we go and right on down wherever you want we need to pull a little reflection under that though so it sets down in the water otherwise it won't look right just it won't come out and play with you okay back to my yellows with a big brush tap a little in there okay let's go back up here and and we can just begin highlighting all those little things see the dark color is only there once again I know you're tired of hearing that word but it's only there so that your light color just jumps out at you there layer after layer start apart does the father's two way and work forward always working forward there okay let's take the knife some van Dyck Brown let's put us in land here and there just indication need a little bit of land to hold all this together there we go like so maybe I'm here there we are little land out here we know what this we left out either and we could have a rock down here whatever whatever it makes you happy it's good do it take a little brown little white and just here and there just put the indication of a little highlight out here on this big stone a little like so okay and we'll take some liquid white and with that we can just put us in a little water line that cleans up the edges and brings everything together and do that firmly act like you're trying to cut a hole right through the canvas and have a little ripple here in there if you want it but keep these lines basically straight are your water but look as I've said before it'll look just like it's gonna run out of the paint get your floor will okay clean off all night here I think it's time we had some fun I'm gonna take a big bunch of Van Dyck Brown on my knife just pull it out pull it out cut off a big roll of paint okay now we had a big tree in our big tree lives does know right there just pull it in be brave this is your bravery test on this painting there we go these trees are fun and they really make your paintings stand out man I'm gonna take some height a little bit of brown touch of a little touch of the bright red in it they're just it's like you're laying snow on the mountain just let that graze just just barely touch barely touch when this is dry it'll feel like real bark that's what my dog does real art there little bit of blue on the other side just to indicate a little reflected light take our liner brush go back into the Van Dyck Brown and this has paint that early so it's very very thin and we can come right up in here in Herring there we just add the indication of a nice tree branch and Limousine all kinds of things wherever you want wherever you want back to our one inch brush one inch brush we'll go into some of the yellows and stuff at it let's put some highlights hmm that's fantastic all we're doing here is just tapping June let's put some highlights want this whole tree to stand out here big strong sign again they're now your thin paint will stick to the thicker paint there we go just let it go right across there you can put a little paint thinner and your paint if you want to just to make it a little bit thinner alright and I think with that we have a completed painting we're gonna call this one finished I hope you've enjoyed it from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless look forward to
