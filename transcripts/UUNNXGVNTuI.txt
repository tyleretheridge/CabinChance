welcome back certainly glad you could join us today I thought today maybe we just do a happy little desert saying just something that is very calm and peaceful enough I think you'll enjoy it so let's start out in hammer on all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us while they're doing that let me show you what I got going up here I have my standard old pre-stretched double primed canvas as usual I use an 18 by 24 inch canvas but you use any size it's convenient for you today I've taken a little contact paper and cut an oval out and stuck it on after I had the contact paper stuck on there and I've just taken and covered the inside area here with a very thin coat of liquid white so the canvas is all wet and slick and ready to go so let's just do a fun painting today thought today would start with your two-inch brush what the heck big old two-inch brush we'll put a little little Prussian blue on there and a little black we'll just mix them together right on the brush so we have black and blue or blue and black depending on your preference there the way I look when I get home late there you go all right let's just go in up in here and we just start like so just using little X's I'm holding the brush flat and making little X's let me get a little more color on the brush there something about like so V don't know maybe I'll have some long stringy clouds in there so we just leave some areas open and we'll come back and we'll we'll fill those up with beautiful little clouds show you a very simple way of making some clouds that are for fun and they're effective and you'll like them there we go I'm gonna be a little back in here wherever wherever we don't care something about like that all right and now we come to my favorite time of the whole painting already let's wash the old brush because if you painted with me before you know that may be the highlight of the painting all right we just scrub it right against the screen in the bottom of the can with odorless tanner in the can shake off the excess and we just cover everybody in the studio and with a clean brush just gonna quickly go across that just removing the excess paint now then I'm gonna take a little touch of yellow ochre a little yellow ochre and go right into the titanium white just load some color in the bristles okay let's go back up here and today I'm just going to tap in happy little cloud just take the brush and just tap just tap just think about some shapes that you'd like to have in your world and tap them in no big deal easy easy you can do this anybody can do this there we go in our newsletter we just featured a lady who's who is in her 90s and just beginning to paint it look fantastic there there's no age barriers in this anybody can do it alright we're just happen in some happy little clouds that's all maybe there's one it lives right about there just basically wherever you think one should live that's exactly exactly the right place for okay and that's all we that's all we need now we're taken now we're taking clean do brush again they're probably just just want to clean the brush again I look for excuses there shake it off and there we go now then very lightly very lightly just graze the canvas because you can always add more pressure and begin blending this and automatically automatically beautiful little clouds will just appear and you can pull them because there's liquid white on the canvas it's wet you can pull these clouds around you can move clouds in your world that easy there never knew you had that much power but on this piece of canvas you do and you go home you may be like me you have no power at all but here here you can do anything anything all right okay let's take the knife take a little Prussian blue depression blue little lizard crimson mix them together Oh Mike a lavender color but I want it to the blue side when you make lavender out of these two colors you can have it to the red side or the blue side sometimes you need to put a little white paint out there and check it out see if that's what you want or not that's pretty good let's use that shoot I like it okay cut off our little roll of paint relives right out of the edge of the knife let's go ahead up in here and we have to make some major decisions already where in the world our little mountains live where where do they live here they are and these are going to be far away I'm not looking for a lot of detail in these the fact I'm looking for almost no detail detail indicates closeness and I don't want them to look close I wouldn't look far away maybe some about like out how's that and the only thing you're worried about at this point is a nice top edge you could care less what's happening in here makes no difference in fact I'm scraping very friendly try to get off all the excess paint there we go let me go back to old two-inch brush I just want to grab this and just blend it out a little bit just a little there just blend it out because that's basically all I'm gonna do in these little distant mountains once again I don't want it to get ate up with too much detail I want to keep them very soft very far away just by stroke so we'll create the illusion of detail but you've done nothing that's our secret that's our secret yeah then let's take a little bit tiny bit of that white and then hit a yellow okra and we'll maybe I'll add just a touch more yellow ocher so we get white in the yellow ocher I want to create mist down here so I'm just gonna take little lip and rub it just rub it st. doesn't let it play around in there I don't know if I'll just do wonderful things if you just allow it to don't be afraid of it don't be afraid of it and see there and you may not see a lot of it yet but when we're finished that'll come out to look like a nice soft misty area there I'm like so say there you have to decide how far up you missed lives and how bright it is how quiet it is it's up to you up to you because in your world you can create any illusion that you want any illusion there okay that'll give us a little background mountains one that's far away not much going on in its world it takes more blue and crimson I just didn't mix up enough before same same color same identical color there we go now cut off a little roll of paint just like we had let's go back up here come right up in here let's start right in here and maybe this comes up we're going to have a big strong mountain that lives in the foreground we'll put a little more detail in that rascal because he's closer to us unlike the one that lives far away and we don't want detail in this one we'll have a little more detail in maybe like it that's a nice old mean-looking mountain shoot I tell you what maybe he had a good day maybe got even stronger it went way up to the top here we up to the very top it's up to you see just change your mind if you want to you can put your Mountain anywhere you want any shape you want this technique we don't do any drawing any Tracey we just sort of we learn to create as we paint that may be the beauty of this there we go we learn to create as we as we paint the scene maybe this goes who knows maybe comes all the way across if you wanted to come over across them be some little rolling hills back here maybe on this you know you can do that we just take the knife and rub that to there wipe off the excess paint you can do entire paintings using nothing but the knife and they're gorgeous some of the earlier series we've done one or two paintings using the entire knife a little harder to do in the timeframe that we have but you can do it you really can do it and it's gorgeous I do a lot of them when I'm at home using nothing but the knife saying if you want to put another layer I get carried away you doing this if you don't put another little layer there you just put a little more paint on decide where that next layer lives and we'll just rub it a little bit to like that I've had people tell me over and over again I bet your house is full of paintings you know it's funny most artists I think are like me they they sort of pick their own paintings apart and every time but I see something that in my mind I think I could have done better or it's it's not exactly what I wanted so in my own home I really hang other people's paintings I have paintings that people have sent me I have paintings that that some of our instructors have done I even have a couple of paintings my son Steve done which are very very special to me there and I have I have a lot of paintings by very close friends and associates Annette Kowalski my partner she does most gorgeous flowers you've ever seen I have some of her paintings hanging around in fact and that's doing her first book on flowers now which will be out soon I think you'll really enjoy that because she can paint some flowers I'm gonna get on the show here one day and get her to show you what she can do because I'm not much of a flower painter but she paints them well enough for both of us there I'm just taking off some of this excess paint I want this to remain very dark though and we can take a big brush and wipe it that too will remove paint I'm gonna put some highlights in there so the more of this paint that you can remove the easier it is to make the next layer stick we get out I want to lose this dark value it's not important to me it's very important okay let's mix this up a little highlight color and for that let's use some dark Sienna we'll put some bright red in there so bright red let's put a little white shoot I need my little crimson here and there awesome yellow ochre well we got a Miss go in there knowing you just sort of pittle around you find the color that you like and I like that so we cut off our little roll of paint we go back up here and now we just begin picking out little things that will make our mountain look special and today I'm just going to sort touch it and sort of just rub the knife on there a little bit just rub it out normally I would pull it down but today I'm just gonna sort of rub the knife in there just to create all kinds of little things there we go something like so add a little white to some of it so it'll be a little bit brighter and then you can take and pick out the areas that you think would that light would strike is it Zing's across there it has a good time there I don't want don't want this to get too bright though do I want it to get too bright okay in fact I'm going to sort of fuzz the edges right out there all right okay just something about my Kevin their baby comes all the way down I don't know where it goes yet will I make that decision pretty soon but right now we don't really much care we don't really much care okay mix up a little more color about to run out you may be out in here there ghosts just let that flow right down the side there and witness latest sort of this sort of disappear off into though to never Neverland right there only right there well then okay I'll take some of that dark color that we have and I want to retain this nice dark edge maybe it comes over and down and just disappears back here but that dark edge is our separator it's a good friend don't lose it don't lose it see there that's what separates pushes it back pushes him back and you can put a little highlight or two here and there wherever you think they should live their deserts are fantastic places there's a lot a lot of fantastic wildlife in there for example there's a lot of Cougars and big cats and recently I had an opportunity to spend a little time with a big old kitty cat that I think is just absolutely gorgeous this Kitty belongs to Carmen Shaw and the cat was given to her where she actually found it I'll tell you that story a minute and all her Carmen's friends have named this this beautiful cat Carmen after her this was a kitty that somebody had purchased as a pet the little kitty turned into a great big cougar grew up and they decided he didn't want it anymore so they put it in a little little kennel cage and they took it out and he left it in the woods to die and when Carmen got this thing it was just about dead she worked with it for a long time and she saved it and this is one of the most beautiful animals God's ever created didn't he gorgeous I can't imagine anybody hurting something like it but I'm sort of strange I like all these crushers anyway all right but I love a big ol kitty don't take a little SAP green little yellow maybe put a little yellow ocher a little browner to dull it down something like yeah maybe an artwork on here I'm going to just start laying a little color and we do this I'll just do a little this with a knife you could put it in with a brush or a knife I want to just put the indication that there's some little things happening back here at the base of this mountain we don't know exactly what they are it's little green things that are growing right back in here one to bright though the one them to be distracting just some little things there just have to wipe the knife off every once in a while but all I'm doing is just rubbing the knife just rubbing it you see there I say you could take the 1 inch or 2 inch brushing you could lay these in much faster but I like this effect it's very soft very misty you just sort of don't you don't know where edges start and stop here that way just very pretty very pretty but we all have individual taste so you do it however makes you happy a little bit Mountain color right here will just blend that down in here too what the heck shoot here and there we might even hit a little that lavender that we used in lace of the mountain just to sort of saw all the tones come together it's your world so you decide got to make big decisions that's a responsibility that comes with there we're speaking of big cats yesterday I had the opportunity to go one of the most fantastic zoos I've ever seen it's right outside of Muncie here who we filmed the show and it's it's called me Zoo and me stands for Max and Arlene the people who started it and they have a lot of very exotic animals beautiful animals but what makes it so special I think is the fact that they they devote their whole life to sharing this this fantastic zoo with other people especially handicapped children the elderly people who are very sick and it's all free to them every bit of it's free these two fantastic people have literally spent everything they have to create this Zoo and they give it away and that's what makes us a special you can find a zoo anywhere in the country but you can't find people like this and you know what makes it more special more special than anything else max has a terminal illness and this is how he has chose to spend the rest of his life he's helping other people through his animals that's what makes it so special so if you ever if you ever around the Muncie or Indianapolis area stop by and say hello tell em I sent you there okay maybe in our world let me clean off my knife hey what let's do let's take the old filbert brush what the heck I'll go into a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown little vendek Brown pick up a little black put in there with it shoot dark sing out - we don't care whatever you get and maybe back here maybe back here maybe there's some old cactus and we're gonna do a desert scene we need to have an old cactus there yes so feel regression and makes the right shape pretty easy maybe he's got another arm right there two or three of my clothes together there's one how many cactus you have in your painting that's up to you let's give that one little arm to like it nedderman right there that's that'll give us a few you can just take this old filbert push upward look make the indication of some little bushes that live far back here see they're just pushing out just pushing it just sort of like you put the foam on our ocean if you painted oceans with me nice take it same brush gone to little the yellows Indian yellow CAD yellow yellow ochre a little bit of a little bit of blue with the time to make a gorgeous green or a little SAP green and then let's just put a few little highlights here and there just a few why don't we stay sort of muted autumn real bright there ain't that neat these are far away so we're not seeing a lot of detail out just enough to make them stand out leave some of them totally dark don't don't don't cover them all up with highlights sometimes he gets feeling good you don't know when to stop I have the trouble all the time so there tell you heart we got a little lavender left right here let's just put some little doers like yes back here with a knife it's a little rock formations maybe that are far back in whatever just sort of you expect this if you'd paint a little pictures from Arizona New Mexico and all those gorgeous areas there something about like so that's good enough we'll take some of that nice this was the color I used to highlight the mountains and maybe right into here right under here I can begin applying just a little bit of sand color something like it there we go see there I'll take a little white it's got a little yellow ocher in it not much just a little mostly white and just begin putting in some highlights right on that barely crate grazing it barely betting crazy see there just to make it look like old sands and rocks and all those things are out there Juliana where it goes don't know that we care wherever it wants to go it's just right just right shoot I like making them cactus hmm doesn't make another one black Browns both Browns and blacks all they used in here and maybe we have a bagel cactus in our world yep we do now and he lives right there just using the old filbert the old filbert brush give him an arm too maybe he's got a friend lens right to him with him who knows maybe he's got two friends he's a popular little cactus she maybe he's got a party going on here who knows as I say make up little stories when you paint shoot us what makes it fun I want to take a little that green color and just come down here just go right all this so it has a little green flavor to it and just make a cat yell a little no SAP green there we go do something like so Manon we'll take we'll take we'll take some more that this is that basically that lavender color I was using maybe there's some little bushes and stuff at liver right along in here it was a big Bush Liz right there by the cactus I'd be a good place to live under this old cactus there would be a multitude of wildlife that lives in it so I'd be a good place to see some beautiful scenes right there right there yeah take a little bit of her yellow ochre CAD yellow little SAP green and let's come back in here and just pop in a few little highlights I'm still using a little filbert today I'm just using a little filbert but you use whatever brush works well for you liking it today I'm gonna let bright red in there to heckum I gotta have a little sparkler here there deserts have some gorgeous color on sometime it's like it's like God had his paintbrush out and he just went crazy with color you ever seen the desert after it comes a rain and and everything lights up just lights up that's got to be the most gorgeous gorgeous thing there let's take a little that blue and white but in here there maybe there's a little little bush it's about that color in there I like it I like it I like that one let's take a little bit of our soil colors dirt color what are we going to call it but right into here something like it just need this darks or Lytle show up on top of it look at there yeah then let's take a little hole use more yellow ocher in white I like that a little that in there this painting has a lot of color and I didn't know it's going to have a bunch of color when I started it but now I like it like that all right okay let's go back into we had some nice lavender color is using here pop in another little blush maybe it lives right there let's put one on the other side too maybe there's one airing there I don't know do you think there should be one there then there should be we go back to our greens little Sam green yellow yellow ocher put a little that here in there like so clean off your brush I know one don't go back to that blue and white I like that blue and white it's a cool color amongst all these warm colors so it sort of stands out there a little bit more of that there see it just a it's just a nice refreshing cool little area in your painting I will just take the old knife and clean it off it's dirty and just blend these areas together here where they come together something like so there shoot I think we're ready take the contact paper off and see what we got looks pretty cute so let's grab a hold of it give it a little pull and look at that it not a fantastic little scene and it's very simple to do you can do it take a little bright red little paint thinner right on the liner brush and I think we'll sign this little painting let's add it right here because we excited anywhere we want there we go since I have a very short name it's no problem just to stick it right in there that I think we have a finished painting I really hope you've enjoyed this one give it a try I'd love to hear from you and know how you do with it from all of us here happy painting and god bless my friend [Music] you [Music]
