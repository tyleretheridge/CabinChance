Hey welcome back I'm glad you could join me today today I have a very special treat for you I'm very proud to present my son Steve Steve's a fantastic artist that we send all over the country to teach the joy of painting and I've asked him to come in today and to show you what he can do in just a couple of minutes so we're going to turn the show over to Steve I'll be back at the end of the show and see what you've done thanks Dan well I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coating of liquid white and the way I'm going to start out today is just touching the brush into a little bit of a lizard and crimson and bringing it out into a separate space on the palate just tapping it straight down turn your brush over tap tap now when the alizarin crimson hits the liquid white it will turn a pink color it won't look like it does on the palate so I'm just going to start right in using horizontal strokes but holding the brush sideways instead of the traditional flat way like this this gives you a little bit more movement in your sky and with that same dirty brush can get a little bit more alizarin crimson and maybe a touch of phthalo blue and I'll come right up here to the left-hand corner and you just kind of bring that right down under the alizarin and always keep your corners the darkest because your sons coming from the center of this painting maybe a tiny bit of light blue in the center and a little bit more blue and alizarin and we'll go up into this corner and make a real dark to and we'll pick up a little bit more that and throw some water in real quick while we got it on the brush it's important that you use mostly the same colors throughout the whole painting it captures the eye better if you do if you use 70 different colors in one painting it usually doesn't look too good and I might even throw a little reflection in the center there now that we got all our shapes in here I'll go back with a clean brush and just blend that out blending the alizarin first because once you hit blue with your brush it'll destroy any alizarin it hits always using that X that's what gives you that movement if I was just to brush it straight back and forth across that just be one solid color and since your corners are real dark make sure you blend them real firmly the more pressure you add on the brush the more the paint will move for you and do a little hypnotizing and come down here in the water just pulling this all straight in okay now I'm going to use my fan brush and just going through a little bit of titanium white and you can add a touch of a lizard into that maybe make your clouds kind of pink now this painting is going to have big clouds and it won't start one right here sometimes you don't want such a bold looking cloud and if you didn't you'd use a probably number three fan brush rather than a number six like I'm using it's really your choice little clouds big clouds whichever you prefer and that's what you do if you get it here in your cloud clouds are usually real flat on the bottom and nice and puffy on top if you remember that you really can't go wrong on clouds now with my big brush preferably a clean one I'll blend the bottom of the cloud out I never touched the top of the cloud that's where you want the most of your highlight to stay and just pull up on it a tiny bit this is real light three hairs and some air as my dad would say and hypnotized it okay and that about does it for the sky now I'm going to take my pallet knife I go through a little bit of brown and a little bit of a lizard and a little bit of blue kind of stripe them out like that into three different piles then take a little bit from each one and put them together in the center and mix that together real good kind of gives you a dark purple color and will come right up here and make a big bold mountain now it's important that you don't kind of linger around here and and mess around with the shape too much because it really doesn't matter as long as you have three or four peaks the highlight is what really counts it's what really makes your mountain probably the thing I would want to tell you to stay away from right here is getting too much paint on the mountain you want to scrape it all the way down to bare canvas and then go back in with your big brush and pull it out and that way you get some of this paint glow down here to mix in with the mountain sometimes whether you do it on purpose or not it's good to leave a real dark line in back of the mountain because that kind of makes it look like a super super dark shadow when you're doing putting the highlights and shadows on sometimes that just turns out as a happy accident it usually just ends if they're on purpose in other words and all I'm doing is just getting a roll of paint on the knife like this just pull it out flat go straight through and you get your roll and touching and just barely just as light as a feather pulling and I've got a tiny bit of a loser in there just like in the clouds and maybe this mountain will have a big Valley and it you ever see that show the big Valley that's where this mountain comes from now I'm going to mix up a little bit of shadow color and to do that you just use the base color that you use for the mountain a little bit of white and some Prussian blue now you get a roll on your knife just like you did with the white except this time you push up into the white a little bit and pull away from it and that drags some of that light out onto the shadow side of the mountain too so it doesn't just look like it's split directly down the center push up and pull it gets kind of tight right in these curves and the valleys right there and you have to come back and clean that up a little bit sometimes see like right around this edge I don't want to come back and maybe over here we'll have a tiny little glacier and that need how you can just decide what you want in a painting and just put it right in there makes it so easy just like my dad I use little brushes for a long time before I ever started using big ones and it's just there's no comparison at all too much too much pedaling around with little stuff okay throw a shadow behind that and we're just about ready to make our mist and to do that we take our big brush tap tap tap tap with the angle of the mountain and pull up with the angle and if you have a shadow crossing over your light like right here then you can come back and put one or two little strokes there because obviously you can't have a shadow casting a highlight okay now with my one-inch brush I'll take a little bit of our base color brown alizarin blue and mix those all together and maybe I'll even throw a tad a SAP green in there and to that you mix white probably the ugliest color you could get at this point would be the best one to use because ugly colors look more natural in a painting than real bright flashy colors you know see what I mean here in a minute now without destroying the mist you have on the mountain you just want to tap in a shape kind of a rolling yellow shape don't make it any harder than it is though just as easy as it looks just splattering it right in and with a clean brush I'll come back and lift that up just maybe a quarter of an inch right on the top and this gives you the illusion of little trees in the background now if you don't pull it straight up it'll look like grass and we're definitely too far away to be seeing grass now when you get down in here just pull all this up and then take the edge of your brush and smash in and this will create mist down at the bottom you can pull that up now with that same dirty brush I used for the first foothill I'll add a little bit more Brown and blue always makes your paint on your brush so you can get a marbled effect in your color if you mix it up with a knife and you just have one flat color and you don't usually see that in nature and try to keep your shapes a little bit different on this one and like before pull this up if you want to get really realistic about it then you should pull these trees up a tiny bit higher than the last row because they are getting a tiny bit closer to you I've been traveling around teaching classes since I was about 15 years old I started out with my dad and by the time I was 17 I was teaching my own classes and I'll tell you one of the biggest things about teaching painting is not really the teaching of it but what you get out of the teaching of it and what you get out of the teaching of it is practice of course when you go into a classroom and teach people how to paint you might do 30 paintings worth of bushes or something trying to show them exactly how to do it so sometimes teaching can be a way to learn now over here on the left side I think I'll throw in a bushy tree and what trees are is just a lot of bushes in one so you make each individual bush and kind of bring them all together see how this is a bush here and this is one here and this is one here I'll just kind of bring a row of grass that's a little bit darker right in front of the foothill and you want to kind of make it come around like this so that when I pull the reflections out it'll look like this is around the bend or something it leads the eye into the painting rather than out of the painting if I had the land going up like this then you'd want to just have your eye go right out now I'm going to put in a little trunk this is just using Van Dyck Brown just touching and the way I'm doing that is just getting a tiny rule paint and touching the canvas real lightly down here at the bottom of course the trunk is going to be a little bit fatter to hold up that top part and maybe a little bit of highlight on that I'll just use a little bit of brown and white together just kind of pulling across the brown letting the thick areas pick up the light this will be an old birch tree and with the same and dirty brush you used to make the tree you can go into a little bit of paint thinner and threw some cadmium yellow just kind of pulling through the paint until you start to see little bushes in the paint like right there and that's when you know you're ready to turn the brush over where that heals to the top and come in and just barely touch sometimes it looks like we're taking a run and jumping leaf and smashing it in but we're really not we're just doing it real lightly and remember where your light source is coming from it's coming from over here so you don't want this side of the tree over here to be darker and don't bring leaves all the way down to the bottom of the tree there now with that same color well I've already got it on my brush I'll go out here and make a few little bushes one here and one there you don't want to make them all the same color so I'll take a little bit more paint thinner still using that same dirty brush you can almost get away with not ever cleaning the brushes if you do it just right this is yellow ochre I'm using now not the prettiest color but like I said at the beginning of the painting all colors aren't supposed to be pretty and maybe some Indian yellow there's a little trick that I teach my students when I'm not traveling around if you're going to put any sort of red in your painting then you want to put it in the center because the eyes always must attract it to the brightest color and if you put red in a painting then obviously it's going to be the brightest color I like to mix red and Indian yellow it gives you a real fire color and you don't need but maybe one of these are one little teeny idea of red you can see how much difference that makes now underneath all of this stuff hanging over the water will drop a little land and you do that just by getting a roll like you did for the mountain and touching and then pulling and sometimes you can even pull and then drop over like this that gives a real good effect still keeping that round Bend look and to highlight that we use that same old brown of white color maybe with a tiny bit of blue in it and I'm just letting the white pick up on the brown where it's real thick and real dense and it's important that you let some Brown come up into your bushes and stuff too so I can come back with a fan brush and a little bit of yellow on it maybe a drop of paint thinner to thin that down and make some grasses okay now I take my big brush and pull just a tiny bit of this out just barely grabbing the edge of the land and see is the land gets bigger so does a reflection naturally so when you get all the way over here pull it all the way down to the bottom and then you can use a clean brush or semi clean in this case to go back and forth make it look more like water and now I'm ready to make my dreaded water line this is where I run into more problems when I'm teaching everybody has problems with their water line you pull it out flat like I did there and you cut across it and what you're doing is just getting a real fine line white on the edge of your knife and then you're cutting it straight in almost like you're trying to cut a hole through the canvas and keep it straight all the way around the bend I know that sounds hard and you'll have a tendency to want to put in a sideways line but don't ever do it always keep it straight okay and maybe right over here we'll have one big huge pine tree and pine trees are real easy you just kind of make them in a in a zigzag shape see just kind of zigzag it right down a lady in one of my dance classes used to call these Z trees because you make it basically like a Z and here maybe a bush or two now with that same dirty fan brush you can go in and put a little bit of highlight on your tree and see how that dirty color you had on there mixes with the yellow and makes kind of a green that's what you're looking for and not every branch but maybe every third branch or every second branch you want a little bit of highlight and a small trunk maybe let's see and to finish it up some real bright bushes up front well as thieves finish to this painting up I would like to come in here and thanks to you very much for demonstrating the joy of painting today and we look forward to seeing you again so from Steve and I happy painting and God bless bye bye you you you
