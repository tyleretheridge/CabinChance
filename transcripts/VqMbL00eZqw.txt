hi I'm glad you could join me again today and they say sometimes you saved the best to last and this is our last show of this the seven series so maybe this is the best today I've got a little bit of a different effect going here I've already covered the canvas with liquid black around here and then liquid white right in here and then sort of just blended it together so tell you what let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this painting with me and they'll come across in the same water as I have them on my palette while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started have some fun I'm going to put a very colorful little sky in here will make a happy little painting I'm going to touch of Indian yellow just a touch just a touch pull a little bit of that out tap it into the bristles just like it just gently tap okay let's go up here now I may be right in here very lightly just making little Criss crosses just bouncing some happy little colors there we go that quick that easy without cleaning the brush I'm going right into a touch of alizarin crimson and just tap a little bit right onto the brush okay maybe I just float a little bit of that here and there there we go nice warm colors this is a happy sky this is one of those paintings that should make you make you relax and just really really enjoy it's very soft very quiet Kenny now that once again without cleaning the brush I won't go right into Van Dyck Brown and a little touch of the blue little touch you the blue line in the Van Dyck Brown okay let's go right up here all of this is mixing with a liquid white and all these effects just happen I don't want to I want to kill all these little colors there we go just want to lay a little this around right now right in here wherever you want wherever okay let me clean this brush scrub it off scrub it off shake off excess and just beat the devil out of it get now with a clean brush I'm gonna go back in here and then we'll again blending all of this just making little crisscross strokes and it doesn't hurt to take your brush you go ahead and pick up a little bit of this black and bring it back in just transfer some of this color back and forth if you want to dull down an area you can pick up a little ick would black bring it right back in and dull it down that easy that easy this liquid black is very good you know you're gonna have big dark areas in your paintings that are gonna be big shadow areas very quickly you can block all that in and it saves you a lot of time I'm lazy always look for an easy way to paint there yes blenders to logistic just the way you want it there we go just stroke across it that takes out all the brushstrokes and you're in business ready to go okay that easy we got a happy little sky let me grab more round brush here and let's mix up a little bit of we'll take some crimson and it's blue and make a purplish lavender color whatever more crimson and blue okay let me clean the knife off I'll take this round brush and tap it just tap it right into the color there you go see they're just tapping alright let's go up here now there's some little trees back in the background so very lightly just barely touching the canvas again laying in some happy little shapes right here how do you want this tree to look where does he live see they're that easy just let your imagination go in here pop in all these little happy shapes there's another one and very lightly lighter they are it look like your father and father away very light some of them we're gonna leave just like they are we get done very touch very to touch whisper light whisper whisper okay maybe right on down in here I don't know wherever you want them wherever you want but darker at the basin at the top okay I'm across that'll give us a nice little background trees that easy tell you what let's take the knife and I'll go into a little bit of the brown pull it out cut across and just a little tiny roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife there we go now just put the indication here and there a few little trunks and all I'm doing is just touching the canvas let the cam just pull off what it wants it'll give you back what's left there I'm just hearing there we're not looking for a lot of distinct shapes just little indications you can just take the clean point of the knife scratching all kind of happy little things out now same old dirty round brush single brush I'm gonna go into a little bit of blue hair a little bit of the crimson and some white and just tap it I'm mixing color right on the brush okay let's go up here put some happy little colors in here and begin deciding where some little highlights are chest just tap them in just tap them in and you can vary this back and forth a little bit between the two colors and put in all kinds of little things maybe right in here lives one it it has a little more of the crimson color it's a little brighter it shines a little more you're gonna have with a little bit of white make it really stand oh look at there all these little things just drop them in wherever you want but not a great deal of paint this is just just indications back here don't overkill and a little bit of Indian yellow too right into the same color same old dirty brush don't don't overbeat it just a little bit of a bright red tiniest little bit don't beat it too much just tap it get away from it okay maybe right in here lives a yep just little indications of all kinds of happy thanks little CAD yellow added to the brush and you can make a multitude of things in here and this should make you happy painting should make you happy just tapping okay let's see there just just tap it let's go ahead up here there's one lives right there so we'd have some blues and some pinks and some lavenders just getting crazy here all kinds of pretty little colors now a little bit of land back here for all that to set on would be nice so I'll go right into some Van Dyke Brown pull that knife or curls get that little roll of paint there we are and right up in here bed make a big decision where's your layin live just let the knife slide right across right across maybe I'll have some water coming down here so I'm gonna leave it higher here than here this water is gonna be moving down we don't know exactly where it's gonna go don't care at this point commit Ryan in there somewhere then we'll take a little bit of yellow little SAP green mixed with it that all these little colors just happen cut across let's go right up here see if that stands out enough yeah nice color very nice hmm just barely grazing the canvas just caress it Kanan you could even take a little bit of Tiny's a little touch of lighter color singing basic color nearly just lighter it just whisper whisper whisper just here and there don't get carried away with this just to make a few little indications it's all you need okay then we could take out a fan brush I go into a little other lavenders and the yellows and greens and all those pretty things okay and a few little bushes it just go right down covers up the edge of all this brings it all together ties it in just ties it all together we're maybe a little color oh right there that's pretty wash your fan brush now go back with a knife now I'm just gonna once again just scratch in a few little trunk indications just here in here just hanging there not overdoing pun overkill wherever you think they ought to be okay that gives us a nice little background to play with now we can come up here and really get crazy and today let's put some water right in there I'm gonna go right into a little bit of the phthalo blue just load a little on the brush I think I'll add a little brown to that just to dull it down blue and brown can't you see how that's loaded though tap it into it okay let's go up here now that I'm gonna come right in here and I'm just adding some blue color this is just 100 color we could care less just to thunder color we'll go right across the black with it even though you can't see it it's blue there the blue is there now then let's have some fun clean that off real quick alright let's go back into the to the titanium white I'm gonna load a lot of paint into the brushes time pull it across I'll add a little tiniest touch of blue into that so it now the portent thing important thing here is to pull it and then just on the last stroke give it a little a little push inward let's do that again pull it and then last moment push it puts a little Ridge of paint right on the edge of the knife now watch here I want to make the indication of thousands of little ripples this water is just floating along here and playing now do you legally pull it get that a little tiny edge of paint now you can't you can't keep playing with this or to go ahead and leave you there look at all the little things that happen didn't that sneaky that's one thing we have tried to do continually in all this series is bring you new ideas new ways of using the equipment new equipment whatever trying to keep you interested keep you happy and most of the shows that we designed and believe it or not come from ideas that people send us if you have ideas drop us a line we'd love to hear from you okay let's say that goes to got right there now there let's have some fun go right into a little bit of the dark Sienna a little Van Dyke Brown little touch it white maybe we'll even throw some red into it just all these nice warm colors all right now right here right here in my mind they're gonna have a nice little tree I just turn this brush he lives right there right there then you get lighter and lighter as you work up for you all right here he's got a friend that lives still into the Browns Abbey right on out here I'm just using straight Brown ooh look at there comes right out my cat now let's sort of capture that water back here and hold it down maybe tell you what maybe I know what I want to do here today I'm gonna put a tiny little waterfall right there so we need we need areas that are higher to contain all this little waterfall maybe let's go right in here we just throw in some nice dark color in here it's beautiful little leaves I live up here and come out see how this liquid black here it really it's done half the work for you already it's one of the nicest things about it super way to use pre-plan your paintings a little bit and think about it if you're gonna have big dark areas Lua can save you a lot of time a lot of time there we go and down in here we don't care that's dark enough we're going to alright gonna have a waterfall let's build a little waterfall go into the liquid white into the firm white a fan brush load a lot of paint into it okay let's go up here maybe the water is traveling along is a little higher here so it's bubbling along total to do Telugu comes here it goes bloop tune and just falls over see it helps to make a little sounds just let it fall over follower see there that simple little tiny waterfall it gets down here and it hits and splashes and got a little churning action just like yet I'll tell you what actually that was so much fun making water like that let's do that again all right now two inch brush and all I'm doing is touching try to keep these lines basically straight there we go all the little foamy things happening this churning and bubbling just traveling alone here maybe it goes let's have a go right off the canvas here I just let it wander around - it goes right off there this is just blue and titanium white they go blue titanium white there we go all right yeah we can begin playing I'm gonna get another fan brush here I have several of them going right into the Van Dyck Brown I load it full well it for on alright right up here we have an indication of a little tree so we put the indication of a little trunk need something to hold that little rascal up here they are here and there maybe on the other side over here back in the woods maybe there's several trees they live back here soon little arms on them we're not looking for a lot of detail yet all we're looking for is these would just be little indications and some of them are sort of show through and they'll make you happy when you see maybe just the least little touch of a indication of a little highlight here and there don't overdo too far away too far away just here and there okay now we can go round back into this old round brush and I'll put some put a little yellow ochre in it and some red tap them together Oh Cass go ahead up here hmm few little indications here maybe I'll add a little white to that so it stands out a little bit I don't know if you can see that too great there that's a little better don't want to get too bright but I want you to be able to see it there we go just a few little leaves hanging on that tree and live out here okay now then I'm gonna take a one-inch brush and go into some SAP green and a little bit of the yellows pull it in one direction through there I want to keep his quite dark also can this go up here now right along in here here's all kinds of little oh look at all the little things living right there see you see you there they come go and back here in the shadows maybe there's some dark things don't want to get too bright back in here stay nice and dark and quiet but all kinds of little things are happening back here we know they're there when you know they're there let's go on the other side for a second here's one here only need to put a few little happy leaves on him there they are don't over do you keep his painting quite dark except out here where it's standing out the light Oh kinds of little things see too many layers doing layers layer after layer after layer tell you what we need here we need something to hold that water in it so let's take some brown on our knife and let's just put a little rock right there maybe there's some landmasses that live right here come out wherever you want them from drop them in over here maybe there's wine projects in front of us ci pushes all that back helps create the illusion of distance there we go they're you know doing the last show of a series is always sort of a sad time for me I know it's that I'm gonna be finished for a while but the next series will be started very soon so we'll be back we'll be back and if you've missed any of the previous shows we have gosh we have over 90 shows now it's almost unreal it's something that's over 45 hours of television but if you've missed any of them give your local station a call tell them you'd like to see them they listen to you let them know what you want okay let's put a little highlight on some of these don't come right out here and just maybe around the edges there just barely grazing barely barely touching hmm but all these little things just happen okay now sometimes it's nice to take the little knife a little bit of dark color on it and create the illusion of little ledges for here there see how you can it's just a little better it gets in there to those little places all right yeah let me go back to my one-inch brush and let's begin dropping in all these happy little things that live right in here okay mmm we'll bring them right on down tell you what maybe they just we don't know where they go I just go right over it I can't pushes water over a little there maybe damn it tell you what maybe there's a little bit of land area right down in here there just let this all a little bit of little bit of land showing there just a pretty little thing little green Indian yellow yellow ochre the reds and this is gonna be out in the Sun more so he's color than that I'll let him shine okay bring us down over here get a little more color there's a happy little Bush right there he's got a friend there and wherever you want him to go wherever mm we'll take the point the knife just scraped in the little trunk indications little sticks and twigs they helped help add interest to your painting people think you took a little one hair brush and work for weeks in there we don't tell any different either we do Shh secret okay let's have some fun here nerds have some fun maybe I'll take your soul big brush and just tap into a little color I'll put just indication it back in here some little leaves that are showing through very light very little color just enough to give a few little indications okay okay now let's grab our fan brush I want to put some huge trees in there let's have some fun go right into the brown load that brush full a lot of paint both sides okay let's go up here maybe maybe an old tree fell over boom you know trees get tired too they have to lay down the job just like I do what snow huh hmm he just fell over right there and tell you what right here lives oh my gosh does know Oh big monster big tree all we're doing is just getting the paint on the canvas peg tree he lives in front of this one that was lazy Hegel tree just put him in maybe there's an arm that goes here we don't know you don't know and over here we can't leave aside up maybe there's even a stump right here we don't know what's here a little stump this trees already fell over and all this lift is as littlefoot's Bigfoot's huh tell you what oh there we go put another one there and in your world you put as many or as few of these big old trees as you want you may not want any if you don't don't put them in I just want to show you how to put them in and then you make the decision all right don't go into some brown and white little dark sienna just mix it all up here so it's marble till I can okay let's go up here and let's begin just laying in the indication of some happy little highlights on this tree like so it's barely touching and it bounced letting it bounce since think we're the light would strike there like your dad hmm bagel tree this one back here maybe maybe in this one here maybe there's just a little light singing through just enough to make this edge shine a little bit just a tiny bit there oh my god just a little indication let's go over here on this one we don't want him left out touch give it a little pull safe let all those little colors huh just mix just mix in here we go a little bit right in there add a little bit more white this one standing right out here no light mm-hmm really make him show had this whole stump he too would still have a little bark left on him there a clean knife take a little blue and put a little shadow inside of this stump look there all right a little bit of that blue I will just touch the other side of the tree little reflected light not much just here and there okay let's do the same thing on this other big one wherever drop him in yeah then I'm going to take put some of the liquid black on the pallet use my liner brush with paint thinner make this a very very thin and with that let's put up let's put some happy little tree limbs here in there maybe this old tree over here is dead so we just have some nicely I'm showing this is just the liquid black with a little paint thinner he put his many or as few as you want on your tree maybe some of them hanging this way too you know they they got hurt we decided this old tree was dead so you can put all kinds of little funny things on the other however many you want all right over here on this big one he's got a few little limbs and grow off the side here too we don't want him left out this one does too okay you go right into the liquid white put a little highlight on a few of them just like so there give you an idea how to do that now they're just going to take a little bit of green on the brush first and then right into my yellows and with that let's go up here and let's put put some leaves on this whole big tree just sort of let them float around here maybe here and there touching forehead just let all these big old leaves just float around there and at home you put as many leaves on yours as you want can make up a very soft beautiful little area lay all these little things in just like so and I think with that we're going to have a completed painting I'd like to thank you for being with me the series I hope we see you again in the very near future until then thanks a million for having me into your home each week god bless and happy
