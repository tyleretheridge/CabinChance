hey welcome back glad you could join me today today I thought we'd do a fun little painting like you really enjoy this one so let's start out and have them graphically run all the colors across your screen that you need to do this painting along with me and as usual they'll come across in the same order as I have them on the palette starting with a white working around while they're doing that let's go up here and talk a little bit about what I've done already as you can see today we have a black canvas now we make these black canvases by coating them with just a thin coat of black acrylic paint and allowing that to dry completely this one's a little bit different because this time I started with yellow I used in the yellow acrylic right in here then I took a little contact paper and cut out a little circle and glued it on to the yellow and then I painted it black then I let it dry and just before we started this I covered the entire canvas with a thin even coat of alizarin crimson now crimson is a very very transparent color this still looks black because it's so transparent now we're ready to start off and have some fun this particular painting I'm going to do today came to me the idea did in the form of a postcard from young man in Arizona so if you're watching thanks you know who you are you're about eleven twelve years old and we write each other I'm going to start out with a little bit of white and I'm going to go right into CAD yellow white and yellow put the white inner just to make the yellow a little brighter there we go really load that brush full look at there a lot of paint in the brush okay let's go right up here now this is going to be our Sun we're gonna have a beautiful sunset so this is the Sun so we'll start from here and work outward we want this area to be the brightest part of our painting okay ready let's just go in here hit it and begin doing this oh my gosh they just start look at that see that way automatically it gets darker darker darker darker as it works out from the side look at that now then the problem is if you need to clean that brush between every loading you don't want to ever take this dark color back into the Sun back into our yellow and white load the brush really full really fold can just do that again right into here boom take out all your frustrations just really sock it spin that brush and begin working on some basic shapes you know an Arizona New Mexico they have some of the most beautiful sunsets a anywhere in the country I have a lot of friends that live there there we go Kate clean the brush again I'm back into my white and cad yellow little brush full alright now that may be boom right here there it comes here there's another this big alarm is coming out from here just make all these beautiful shakes but you can see how this yellow is picking up at crimson its underneath and don't stay in one place and keep grinding it move it keep adding rescue moving washing the brush again I bet we're out of fan brush here yellow and white hey let's go right in here hit it again this time we'll just bring this one maybe it just works right on off in here just like so maybe there's this happy little things floating around here and there wherever you want wherever and right along in here let's just do some little stringy things just put a few of those and a few little fluffy ones just as many of these as you want there we go okay now then if you just tried blending all this chances are it would just mush up and you'd end up with a mess I'm gonna take the knife and very lightly just zip off some of the heavier areas where there's a lot of paint that color remains in the canvas don't worry about it see there just zip it right off hope you wore your sunglasses today this is going to be a bright painting there we go and when you're doing these black canvasses you can do the base color with any of the transparent colors the blues the greens that they all work just as well so experiment to have some fun all right let's take the two-inch brush and now very gently let's just begin blend they start in the light area and work outward look at their looker there all kinds of beautiful effects will just happen automatically these are our happy accidents don't fight them don't really try to play them this just just sort of do it and see what happens okay now I'm going to wash the brush I'm beginning to pick up a little bit more paint than I want so wash your brush at least by the time you finish this painting you're gonna be an expert brush washer let's go up in here and continue to blend anytime you go back to this light area you always have a clean brush whether it's a fan brush a two inch brush makes no difference always a clean brush in there look at all the beautiful red colors that are just shining hmm that is one fantastic sky and they're very easy to do and as I said earlier on you when you're trying this at home experiment a little try all kinds of different colors try some of the Oh like they low blue is very transparent Prussian blue all the greens are very transparent you can just make some unbelievable effects on these black canvases now then let's have some more fun take the same color same color loaded back on the fan brush and let's just put let's put some more of these little stringy clouds in here I like you they're sort of close to the horizon I'm sure there's a proper name for these clouds I just call them little stringy clouds I'm bad about making up words so don't go to your dictionary and try to find half of them there we go just just little happy things there okay now very gently just blend these see they're that easy that easy now let's have some fun let's come up here and let's remove this piece of contact paper that I have here and I'll show you what's underneath it so let's come right in here watch just take the knife pick up the edge grab it and look at there look at that mm-hmm getting that a super easy way to put in a happy little son can now then let me find a clean fan brush and I'm gonna bring a little bit of that color over just to bring the edges together with two soffit she has to soften it all together look at that see there may be there's a happy little cloud it just sort of floats across there you can just pick up a little the color and bring it right across and you can make a a beautiful moon this way too didn't have to be the Sun it could be the moon and then it would take a little more of that bright yellow color that's white with a little care yellow maybe there's a little cloud or two it just just literally floats right across I can't however many of you want and with a clean dry two inch brush very gently just blend all that together that easy okay Hayden Anna in that a sneaky little way of making a beautiful beautiful sky very easy I thought you'd like it let's have some more fun we'll take some Van Dyke Brown some dark sienna throw in a little black to what the heck we're just looking mainly for dark colors we can throw in some crimson whatever you got to start drop it in there load that brush full of paint look at all the paint can let's go right up in here and maybe there's a maybe there's a happy little mountain we're gonna have a small mountain disc because we want it to be far far away and I'm just going to use that just the corner of the fan brush to put in our basic shape what as I say New Mexico Arizona and all those they have some of the most beautiful beautiful mountain formations certainly not like the mountains that I grew up with in Alaska but beautiful okay maybe we'll have this one grow a little bit have some of the most unique rock formations there we go see that oh I know what the snoop let's have some fun right underneath here I'm gonna take some of the same yellowish color and pull it straight down like a reflection so you pull it straight down go straight down and we'll take a big brush grab it pull hard see and we're gonna have some light under there look at that see now we have a little light area and our little mountain color same mountain color we can just pull that right on down it goes right off into there wherever we don't know where it goes don't really care okay and we let me grab another fan brush I have several fan brushes going so I don't have to spend all my time cleaning you go into a little yellow little bright red yellow ochre a little Indian yell just just sort of mix all these colors up on the brush I'm gonna reach up here and grab a little bit of the dark seeing it too there there may be a little more red okay now we have a multitude of colors going on that brush is not just one color that you can see a little better look at a hold of things happening good let's go up here now then here's our light source so we're gonna touch and begin just creating the illusion of all kinds of beautiful little rock formations I'm just using them just the corner the fan brush look at all those it's a super nice easy way to make some of the beautiful mountains some fantastic rock colors that you see in that part of the country hmm see I know there's an old coyote sitting out there I can just sort of feel it he said we down here to base looking up at the moon and he's singing his song there we are maybe a little touch over in here don't too much don't too much in anywhere you want you to go back with the dark and shadow it you can change these as often as you want come back put a little more red right in there or they let that one really sing hmm and that neat oh that you can do them that easy okay come grab a little touch more of the red that look so good put something there too just throwing all kinds of little highlights we get some of the most fantastic letters from our friends and in this part of the country you know it's it's unreal in some parts of some parts of the country in Arizona specifically they're playing our show is as much as an hour and a half a day three shows a day that's that's unbelievable cata thank you very much and if we're not playing the show as often as you'd like in your you call you station let him know what you'd like to see they'd like to hear from you okay sometimes I I get to talk in here and forget to paint so with paint we'll go back and we'll get right into our dark sienna and a little Van Dyke Brown tap a little color in there Kenny let's go ahead up here now then we begin to worry about the lay of the land just gonna begin picking up some little things here don't want to kill this little bright eerie I want to look like is a little light shining through there when we're finished leave some of those little soft mysterious so I want this back here to be very dark okay now I'm gonna touch just a little bit of that same color that we used to highlight the mountain here and begin playing a little bit here and there just where I think light would strike don't overdo don't overdo there I just work right down into there see that little little soft area still stays in there that's what we're looking for okay maybe there's another little hill right here so you could just begin creating all kinds of illusions there we go well that is one fantastic sky I hope you enjoy this guy every day hope you try it said earlier a young friend sent me a postcard it it really gave me the idea for this painting we get so many of our ideas from from cards and photographs of people send so if you have something you'd like you'd like to see painting send them current I'd love to hear from you yeah then maybe over here we have a little hill coming down here I'm back to my dark color just dropping that in I tell you what that looks just like a natural place or to be a happy little path going we'll do that in a minute group a little path in there why not don't let your color get too bright on these canvases these black canvases show color it seems like a hundred times more than a white canvas so be careful with them be careful be careful color just stands out on let's take a let's take a fan brush here and I'm just going to very lightly come right up in here just sort of work it back and forth and Creasy just that easy you can create the illusion of a little path and okay all you had to have a way to walk up and get up on this mountain so he could sing to the moon or the Sun whatever I think we said this was a sunset didn't look like a moon scene to me though look at the efficacy can you see that path just coming right in there that easy and it sort of goes around the corner try to avoid having your path perfectly straight it really looks a little bitter it's got a little oh and it little bend in it just a gentle bill it sounds like a good name for a TV show on gentlemen gonna have to remember that there we go now then back to my back to my two inch brush let's just tap in a little bit more of this color just this this is yellow ocher little Indian yell over the CAD yellow and it's on that dirty brush it has the brown in it so just allow these colors to all mix on the brush just have it okay and you have to sort of make big decisions here whereas where's your next little hill going to be there it is see and you can create plane after plane after plane just that easy that easy and fantastic it you can make such effects so quickly darker darker target architecture see and that sort of closes that little path in there we go this is Arizona New Mexico and I know we got to put a cactus in this side I got we can we got to have a cactus now I gotta admit to you where I live in Alaska there is not a whole bunch of cactus they're sort of rare but but I'll do my best here I'll do my best so if the cactus don't look just like it does in your yard if you live in that area pretend there's snow on it there we go okay see that easy we've got some nice little Hills here and it creates a lot of distance by having all of these different planes you can see we back in there there all right this has some fun with them some cactus I'm gonna go right into the liquid black with a liner brush just just dip it right in okay maybe there's a little cacti and that what you call him cacti or maybe that's more than one he lives we back in the distance right there and he's got arm see there get a little more paint we'll give him another arm look at there maybe you can just see the indication of a third arm there by golly that's not a bad-looking little cactus let's have one right here in front of the moon will make us one even further back father back he's tiny little cactus tiny just using the liner brush there give him a little arm right there okay now then let's have a big cactus we need a big strong cactus he he really got a lot of light and life was good to him so let's see let's build a big one big ol cactus a lot of black I think this big cactus is gonna live he certainly is right now right there right there there this is just straight midnight black okay like that we just make you with a fan brush let's give him a big arm right here bagel our comes right down and bins OOP just like yet there we are give him a big strong he stands out here and waves and everybody that goes by bring it around I can't does that look like a cactus there we go and down here we need a big strong bottom so it holds up all these arms and maybe we can just see the indication here of a third arm it comes right out here comes right on down just use your fan brush look at there see now this cactus has three arms be hard to make a sweater for him there we go now we can begin getting the shape all the way we want it all right I came a little bigger down here at the base he needs a strong foots to hold a fall that weight and sometimes sometimes there's just little cactuses that little barrel cactuses are on it look like it they look like the little post stuck in the ground nearly there pretty there we go yeah okay okay that gives us a basic shape for a little cactus let me wash it fan brush here and in your painting you put as many cactus as you want for forest view now cactus a normally green so I'm going to go right into the black a little black right there and a touch of the yellow say just a touch when you mix black and yellow it makes a beautiful green and I'm going to tap I want to tap the brush and remove any the excess paint maybe so it'll show up a little bit of a light at least little touch of white that's when you're painting yours maybe you don't want to add the white I just want you to be able to see it better tap out that excess paint their tents go back up here I want to make just look like here's a whole bunch of little sticky things on it so just touch see and start on the edge because here's your light coming from coming from the moon over here the Sun and just begin tapping so you start at the bright edge and work around that way it'll get dark or darker darker as it works around the cactus and it makes it look around and that's sort of nice I'm square cactus if they're sort of rare there we go either just tap tap tap and it gives the feeling of roundness to your cactus maybe maybe right out here lights plan through and you can see a little bit of fuzzy things right out of edge there little fuzzy things what sticking your finger when you touch him make you go oh just just a tank we don't want this arm over here to be left tail so you see what's happening there all we're doing is just touching just touch start with the outside edge do it first so it'll automatically be the brightest and then tap tap tap run around like it maybe a touch more right to it listen we all really let some light dropper right in look at their little bit of lights just singing right to that want to stand out nicely now if you want to keep that when looking like it's in the back I'll take my dark paint pull it distinctly over it so that way it makes that arm stay around that side if you don't watch it these alarms will sneak around on this side on you there's make you little dudes okay this little round cactus here we want some most highlight right on the top like yet and then just gently gently come down the side same way just barely barely tapping lighter lighter lighter so it gets dark or darker as it comes around we let it come right on out there we go and I hope this gives you a nice idea I hope my friends like this in Arizona in New Mexico because they broke me several letters wanting to have some paintings that showed their part of the country they're very proud of their part and it is some of the prettiest prettiest country in the world I went to the Grand Canyon one time never seen such a hole in the ground good gosh it's beautiful all right T now we can just put on a few little highlights here and there well brighten these up a little I'm using just a yellow-green D and yellow touch of the bright red just a touch just sharpen those up be careful with that red when it son of a gun will eat up your whole world in a second there we are okay I think we're getting the feeling of a nice desert II type thing here now one of the things that worked very well was this light area that we put in here that really really does help let's take a little bit of red will sign this when they call it done I hope you've enjoyed it and I look forward to seeing you again next week so from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless you
