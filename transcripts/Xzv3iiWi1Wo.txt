- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. It's a fantastic day here. And I hope it is wherever you're at. Let's start out today and have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what I got done up here. Have my standard old pre-stretched
double primed canvas, and I've just covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of liquid white. The liquid white's there just
to make it slick and wet, and it makes painting much easier. I thought maybe today we'd do a... Maybe a winter scene that's very warm, and I think you'll like it. Let's start out with
a little Indian yellow on the old two inch brush. Don't need much, just a small
amount of Indian yellow. We'll go right up in here. Sometimes winter scenes can be so cold that they're almost difficult to look at. So I thought today we'd do a winter scene that's very warm, that's very pretty. It'll just sort of make you feel good. There, pretty bit of the Indian yellow. Without even washing the brush, we'll go right into some yellow ochre. Little bit of yellow ochre. We'll just blend that using little X's, little crisscross strokes. But you don't even have to wash the brush, you can go right into the yellow ochre. No big deal. There. Shoot, that's working so good. Tell you what, we'll go right into, once again without washing the brush, a little bit of the bright red. We'll just have a
firecracker of a sky up here. Beautiful sky. One that makes you feel
good when you look at it. You hang this in your room, when you walk in, it'll
absolutely warm up a room. There we are. And we all have rooms in our home that need to be warmed up. There. All right. Yeah, maybe I'll wash
the old brush finally. But already we've blended
those colors together. It's very pretty. Indian yellow, yellow ochre, and then the bright red. And now let's wash the brush. As you know, we wash our brushes in odorless paint thinner. And we'll shake off the excess. (whipping) (chuckling) And you just beat the devil out of it. That really is the fun part. Now then, I'mma go into
a little bit of the, little bit of the pthalo blue. Just a small amount. Let's go right up here to the top. Still using little
crisscrosses, little X-strokes. We'll just put in the rest of
the sky using the pthalo blue. That easy. Something about like that. There. Then I'll wash the brush, and come back and blend those together. All right. Now that we have that blue in there, let's just go across the bottom. We're gonna have a little snow, that'll just end up being
some beautiful shadows in our snow. And it's good way to wipe the excess paint out of your brush. Okay. And one more time we'll
wash the old brush. Really and truly, the brush washing is the most fun part of this. (brush whipping) (chuckling) That's the way I get even with the crew for hassling me. All right. Now that we have a clean, dry brush, I just want to blend these areas together. About like that. And that's all we're looking for. All right. (brush whipping) Now, today let's take a little fan brush. I'm using a number six fan brush. Sometimes some people like
to use a number three. It's a little smaller, and some people feel a little
more comfortable with it. It's up to you. Okay, maybe in our world there's
a happy little cloud. Just sort of floats
around in the sky up here and has a good time. There, a little more color. There we are. See, just let it float around, though. Clouds may be one of the
freest things in nature. So just let 'em go, let 'em have a good time in your world. All right. Now then, back to a two inch brush... And very gently I'm just gonna blend that back edge out til it disappears. Right into nothing. Then we'll fluff the cloud. See there? Just sort of fluff it up. Fluff it up. All right. Then it gives the indication of a little cloud that's living far away. Tell you what, shoot... Cloud needs a little friend. So we'll give him one, lives right there. Just a happy little guy. In my world, everything is happy. So we have happy little
clouds and happy trees. All right, there we go. And once again... (whipping) I beat the brush just to knock any, any excess paint off of it, so I don't have to go through
the whole cleaning procedure. There. If you just have a
little paint on the tip, that way you can clean the brush without going through all the washing and splattering everybody. Just makes it a lot easier. There we are. Something about like that. And I just want the indication of some little happy clouds, as I say, far away. Don't need a lot of detail. All right. Let's have some fun. Let's take, let's take, we'll use today some Prussian blue, a little bit of black, put a little crimson in it, too. What the heck. Maybe a little more crimson. And some white. Notice I'm leaving part of it dark and putting white only on one side. That's so I can use the same color in a darker value later on. It's called lazy man's way of painting. Wipe the old knife off. And we'll use, shoot, we'll just use that same old brush, it doesn't matter. Gonna tap a little color right into the bristles
of the two inch brush. And let's go up in here. Maybe in our world, yeah, a little footy hill lives way back here. Here it comes. There. Just sort of let it run across here. Wherever you want it to go. All right. Then I'm gonna give it a
little small, upward lift so it looks like the top's
of little distant trees that live far, far away. Far away, we don't need
to know where they live. Don't know that we care. Clean two inch brush, and I'm gonna tap the base of this to create the illusion of mist. Something about like that. There we go. I just want to soften the bottom edge. There. 'Cuz I want to put another layer in. Back to the brush that
had the dark color on it. Now I'm going back into the
darkest part of that color. This is the darkest part. Still has a little white in it, but it's darker than
what's up there already. Let's go back up here. Maybe there's another little foothill that lives right in here. Notice that little misty area that we put in there. That becomes the separator. Becomes your best friend. Cherish it, take care of it. Take care of it 'cuz it'll
separate these two areas. Now I'm gonna lift up once again. Chickity, chickity, chickity. Gotta make those little noises. There. Something about like that. And one more time, I'm just trading brushes here. I'm going back to the clean one so I can tap the base of this and create more of that misty area. If you need it, you could actually take a little bit of titanium white paint on the brush... And create more distinct mist. Today we don't need it. But maybe when you're painting, you want a little lighter
area than we have here. Just add a little titanium
white to your brush. You can do that. All right. But now see, this one, the second one is darker
than the first one so it makes it look closer
to you in the landscape. All right, let's have some fun. I'm gonna clean that up. Let's take the same color, Prussian blue, black, and alizarin crimson. And we just mix them together once again. Okay, wipe off the old knife. Here we are. Now, today let's get a fan brush. I want to make the
indication of some trees that are living closer to us. So now this is pure color, it has no white in it at all. These will be the closest, so I want them to be the darkest. And all we'll do is just tap 'em downward. Just tap downward like that. Don't want too much detail. It's too far away. When you're painting
things that are far away, the lack of detail helps create that illusion of distance. If you have too much detail
when it's far, far away, it'll boggle your eye, even if you don't really understand why. I know you've looked at
paintings and you've said, "Hey, something's wrong in that painting. "Don't know what it is, "but something's wrong with it." Sometimes it can be
something as simple as that. And your mind tells you... It just isn't right. There. You decide where they live in your world. Wherever. Let's say about there, that's good. Now then, we can take this brush, and I'm just gonna lift
it upward a little bit. Just a little. Sort of to smooth it together. I want to leave these little
light areas down at the base. I'll show you why in just a second. 'Cuz I'm gonna put some
snow underneath these. So I want those little
areas to stay in there. If everything works just right, it'll look like misty little tree trunks and all kinds of happy
little things in there. Okay. Let's wash the old brush again. (chuckles) You figured it out. I just like to wash the brush. Shake it off. (whipping) (chuckling) And just beat
them, I'll get two of 'em. Let's wash 'em both. We'll wash 'em both while we got it goin'. (whipping)
There. People have realized this
brush-beating is so much fun, I get letters from friends
all over the country. They tell me they really
don't want to paint, they just bought a brush and beat it to take out their
hostilities and frustrations, and that's okay. Titanium white, we're
gonna use the big brush. Load a lot of color into it like that. So often we avoid this big brush, because it is big. It will do wonderful things. Watch, watch, watch. Maybe, watch, right there. Just make a decision. And we have snow in our world. That easy. Put a little more on there. I'm just adding some
more white to my brush. There. Snow is one of the easiest
things there is to paint. Look it there. But see that blue that we
put on now shows through, and it looks like shadows. Right back there in our world. Okay. Now then, grab another, another little two inch brush. I'm gonna take a little bit of the, we'll use a little Van Dyke
brown, a little dark sienna, just mixed together, something like so. And let's put a little tree back here. We'll just make it with a two inch brush. I'm just gonna tap in... Just a basic shape of a little tree. This'll be a good place for
my little squirrel to live in. You know, speakin' of my little squirrel, I've got a new little baby squirrel. I wanna show him to ya. He's the cutest little
devil you've ever seen. Watch him. Look at him,
isn't he somethin'? He is so pretty. I call him Peapod, Jr. If you've painted with me for a while, you know that Peapod was a little squirrel that I had for a long time who lived in my pocket. There. Isn't that the cutest
little devil you ever seen? If you're not careful, you can get attached to
these little rascals. And I do. They're very, very special to me. And every year I raise several of them, and we turn 'em loose. And normally they go out-- (whipping) Beating my brush there. They go out and just live in my yard. We have a good time. And they're happy out there. We sort of maintain 'em. We turn 'em loose, but at the same time, I
keep food out there for 'em. I'm thinkin' a little bit of white, a little bit of the bright red. Just tapping the corner
of the brush into it. Just like that. Okay, let's go up in here. I want to use that just
to put the indication of a few little highlights on this tree. Little snowy things. There. I don't want it to be too distinct, just some indications. Wherever. But think about some basic
shapes and forms in this. Don't just throw 'em on at random. It is important that they have shape. It gives the tree personality. There. All right, maybe a little
bit right in there. Something like that. Wherever. In your world, you make
these big decisions where all these little things live. It is totally and completely up to you. Just scrape in the indication
of a few little sticks and arms that live in the tree. Shoot, we're in business. Now then... Let's see what we got goin' here. Prussian blue, black, alizarin crimson, maybe even a little Van
Dyke, it doesn't matter. As long as it's good and dark, and has some blue in it. Clean off the knife. And let's see, we'll grab a, there's old fan brush. I'm gonna load it full of this dark color. Just full of it. There we are. Maybe, maybe, you know me, I like trees. It's your bravery test, are you ready? Let's come right up in here. Right there. Just start by making a
little touch on the canvas. Then use the corner of the brush, working back and forth, forth and back. There we are. See? They live right
here in your fan brush. All you gotta do is just
sort of scare 'em out. Here he comes. We'll just come right down
the front of this tree. 'Cuz in your world, you
can make these decisions, and you can move 'em
anywhere that you want 'em. Shoot, I like that. I'm gonna have another tree. Load a little bit more paint. We'll have one right above this. Right over the top. There. See? That easy, we got another little tree. We'll just take the
knife, cut through here. Make it look like there's
a little trunk in there. There. Now then... I'm gonna wash my fan
brush off a little bit. Fan brush isn't as much fun
to wash as a two inch brush. You can have a lot of
fun with a two inch brush and get even with anybody
that's hassling you. Fan brush isn't much fun. I'm gonna take a little white. Put a little liquid white in it, too, just to thin it down. Little bit of pthalo blue. Pthalo blue. There. And we'll go up in here. And with that let's put a few highlights on this tree. I want to keep it pretty dark. But a few highlights. This is a blue spruce,
it looks like to me. There you go, few more
little duders right in there. And off we go. All right. Now maybe grab a one inch brush. Okay, one inch brush. We'll go into a little pthalo blue and that dark color we had, it doesn't much matter. Want a little pthalo blue in it, though. And right up in here, maybe there's a happy little
bush lives right here. I don't know. Up to you. You make the decision where you think all these little things would live in your world. About like that. And let's see, we'll grab
another one inch brush. I have several of them going. Show you a little trick. I'll take some liquid white, put that here. There, let me grab some more of that. Some liquid white, I'm gonna
put a little bright red in it to make a nice pinkish color that is very, very thin, though. Very thin. Okay. Now. We'll take our one inch brush, and we dip it in the liquid white. 'Cuz as you know, our
golden rule is a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Get a little touch of the pthalo blue. I'll be right back, I'm gonna grab a little
more of the liquid white. I want it a little thinner. Pull the brush in one direction. Now right at the last here, I'm gonna take it over and take just the top through a little bit of
that pink color we've made. Okay? Now when we put highlights
on these little bushes... They'll have nice little
pinky tops on 'em. And it just warms 'em up, makes 'em pretty. Sneaky, isn't it? There. That easy. That easy. You can do it. Just gives a little
sparkle to your painting. If you want 'em all
blue, that's okay, too. It's up to you. Totally and completely up to you. Go back to an old two inch brush, put some white on it. And I'm gonna grab, and intentionally I'm grabbing a little bit of this dark color. And I wanna pull it. Pull it. There. See? And we'll change the angle of the snow. Right there. That easy. Just with using this big ol' brush. As I say, snow is very,
very easy to paint. when you're using brushes this big. It doesn't take but just a second. Shoot. You know me, (chuckles) I want a little
cabin right out here. 'Cuz this would be an ideal place to live. Let's scrape out the paint. By scraping the paint
out it does two things: it allows us just to sort of
lay out our basic shape... And secondly, it removes excess paint. Take a little Van Dyke brown. Praint the back eave, the front. Just about like that. There. See? But you're still not committed. You can change your mind. That's what so great about this. A little dark sienna mixed in there, too. There. And we'll take a little white. Little bit of the brown, mix it together. Barely grazing the canvas. Barely touching it. Just let it float right down there. Make it look like old wood. Now on the other side, not much light's gonna hit over there. I want it very dark. Just, that's enough. Just enough to give a hint of color. While we have that dark on the knife, shoop, now we have a little door. That easy. And we can come back, make it look like a old, slab building. Put some boards on it. Now the most important part, we gotta put a roof on it. We don't want it to snow in on him. So we'll take a little
of the titanium white. Come right up in here. I like to sort of lay out the shapes, so I have a nice straight
edge to work from there. And then when you pull it down, shoop, it's nice and straight. That easy. Over here on the other side, just a little snow. Like that. Take a little touch of light color, sort of outline the door. Little bit. There we are. And we're in business. Take your knife and do a cabin-ectomy. That means we just cut it off to however we want it. There we go. Now, back to our old brush, our old two inch brush
that had the white on it. Come down here and clean
up the edges a little. Shoop. About like that. Shoot, we're in business. Now... Maybe a few little bushes
growing around the edge here. Something about like so. Because he probably was like me, he didn't take care of his lawn very well and it grew up. Come winter time hit, still there. Now then, come back in here. Tap in a few little bushes. This is once again the
liquid white, titanium white. Just mixed together to thin the paint a little. It's the only you're doing, just thinning the paint a little bit so it'll stick right on the top of that. Now. All right, I like that side. Let's do the other side. Bravery test. Gonna load it full of dark color. Right there. Let's have a big old tree
that lives in our world. I like big trees. There they are. And you could actually make these trees with a one inch brush, two inch brush, whatever. Up to you. I like the fan brush sometimes. When you want a little more detail, it does give you a little more detail. We'll create another one right there. Something about like that. Recently we took a trip to Japan... And met all of our friends
in Japan who are painting. And we did a painting
very similar to this. And it went over so well. People liked it. Some fantastic painters there. Fantastic. We have a whole group
of instructors in Japan that are literally spreading the joy from one end of Japan to the other. There. All right. How's that? We got three trees now. And once again, we can take the knife, Just scrape in some indication of a few little trunks and things... That live in there. All you're doin' is
scrapin' through the paint, let the canvas show a little. Maybe there's a stick there, we don't know. All right. Back to our one inch brush. I want to change the angle here. So I'll put in a bush or
two right here like that. Yeah, yeah, that'll do it. Liquid white on the fan brush, back in to a little titanium white, a little pthalo blue. Okay, let's go back up in here. Now, I have to decide
which tree is in the front. I think the big one is. So I'm gonna put a little indication on the ones that are farther behind first. Darker, darker, darker. Just turn the brush over, we use this one. There, just let it disappear. Let it disappear. It gets
darker toward the base. Then we can come in here. This tree is in the foreground, so we make it the predominant tree. This is the boss tree. There. All right. Now, we're gonna dip our one inch brush into liquid white, little
bit of the pthalo blue. Once again I'm gonna take the tips through that little bit of pink. I like that little pink right on the edge. And we'll just drop that right in somethin' like so. See there? And we'll put in all kind of little bushes where they live here. There. Back to the old two inch brush, put a little snow right in like that. There. Somethin' about like that. All right. Hey then, that easy, we got a happy little duder there. And we'll take the little liner brush. Just a little bit of brown on it. I'll put the indication right here. Doo, doo, little fence that goes back off, back in there. There he goes. Something like so. Shoot, I think with that, we got a finished painting. This is one I hope you'll try. I know you'll enjoy it. Until next time, from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friends. (mellow soft rock music)
