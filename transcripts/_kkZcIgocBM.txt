- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, cause it's a fantastic day here. And I hope it is wherever you're at. Today, I thoubght we'd do something that's just a little bit
different, but, as usual, I'll start out and run all
the colors across the screen. They'll come right there. So
you can paint along at home. Today, I have an oval. This
is an oval canvas, and you can purchase these at any art
dealer in the country, I guess. It's just an oval canvas.
Normally, we make a lot of ovals and we use contact paper. Today, I thought we'd
just make the oval itself. Something just a little
more interesting, isn't it? It's very interesting when
you hang these in your house. They do make oval frames that
fit these so they're gorgeous. I've covered the entire little
oval with a thin, even coat of liquid white, so it's
all wet and ready to go, and let's just have some fun today. Let's start with our
little two-inch brush. I'm going to a small amount
of the indian yellow. Very, very small amount.
I don't need much. Just tap the brush into it a little bit. Okay, let's go up in here. Let's
just make a little painting on this oval that's
very warm. We'll use ... Let's just use all nice
earth tones, browns, and a very, very warm little
painting. One that'll ... it'll make you feel good. And that's what painting's all about. We'll just start out making
a little doer like that. Take a little yellow ochre.
I didn't clean the brush, a little yellow ochre, and
we'll go right around that. We're making little tiny
criss-cross strokes because they're easier to blend out
than if you make a big circle. So make little criss-cross
strokes. Make your life easier. We're looking for easy ways to paint here. We want things to work very, very easy. There. And you can take this out
to wherever you want it. It's up to you. Totally,
and completely, up to you. There we go. Maybe about to there. We'll come back in a minute
and blend all this together. There we are. We have somethin' for the Museum of Modern Art already.
We can stop right there. Now then, I've made a
brown color today by mixing alizarin crimson, and sap green together in about equal proportions. And I just pre-mixed that
to save a few minutes. It's just these two colors mixed together. It makes a very warm brown,
and you can take it to the reddish side or the
greenish side. Up to you. There we are. I sorta like
mine to the reddish side a little bit, once in a while,
so. If you want to add more, you can just reach over here
and get a little of the red and add it right in there. Let's go up in here. Now, around this edge,
I'm just going to begin blending that same color all
the way around, like that. All the way around, we don't care. Wherever, we'll go all
the way out to the ... let's go out to the edge of the canvas. Now, make it just a little bit
darker than you want it to be because it's gonna continually
mix with the liquid white that's on the canvas, and
automatically, your color's gonna get a little bit lighter. There! Yeah. While I have a
little brown on there, let's just do somethin' like this. This is just the brown made
from crimson and sap green. That's all it is. About like that. That's
what we're looking for. Now, fun time, let me wash the ole brush. I just like to wash the brush. Okay, we wash our brush
with odorless paint thinner. In the bottom of this little
bucket here, there's a screen that I scrub the bristles against. That allows the solid materials to sort of settle to the bottom.
[brush beats on bucket] Kick the bucket, there. [chuckle] If your solid material
settles to the bottom, then it keeps your paint
thinner relatively clean. Okay, I'm going to a little
bit of titanium white. Just in the corner of the brush. Start right here in the center,
and begin working around. All the way around. Work outward, continually
blending outward. We start in the light area,
and work toward the dark. If you reverse that, you're
gonna lose your nice, light area in the center. Just blend this out until
it's nice and smooth, and you can't tell where one color
stops and the next color starts. There, something about like that. There we are. Okay. I'm just beating
the brush to remove any excess paint off of it. Then we can blend the entire sky area. We're basically in business!
That's all I'm gonna do for this little sky. It's very simple. It works well, and it's gorgeous. And we get to wash the brush again. That's really the most fun
part of this whole technique. There. All right. Let's take ... Let's take a little brown.
That's the same brown we made, that's the only brown we're using today. It's just the crimson and the sap green. Be right back, I'm gonna get
a little white to mix with it. So, we make a light color
brown, about like a, maybe a little more white.
Let me wipe the knife. And today, I'll tell you,
let's use a fan brush. I'm gonna load both sides full of color. Just work it right through
the paint. About like that. Let me get a little more white. I want that a little lighter. Yeah. Maybe even ... Shoot, let's get crazy. Add a little bit of yellow ochre to it. I like that better, it's warmer. Okay let's go up in here. Now, maybe in our world here,
there's a little tree line, and it comes right here,
and all we're gonna do is just begin tapping the canvas.
That's all there is to it. There. See? Just tap these in, and I want
them to just sort of disappear out here on the edge. The color is almost the
same there. Almost the same. There we go. All we're doing is just tapping
downward with the fan brush. Very, very easy. Even
if you've never painted, this one you can do. It's a
very easy little painting. Okay, a little more color. Maybe these go ... We don't know. On over here somewhere. You make the big decision.
What's fun about painting is you get to control complete worlds here. Okay back to my two-inch brush.
[brush beats against bucket] Now, all I want to do,
is just tap it. Tap it so this blends right out. You
can even tap a little bit of titanium white on your
brush if you want to create a more distinct, misty area.
Tap it in that easy. Up to you. All right. Now Maybe, in our world, let me
get a little bit more brown on my brush. Maybe there's
another layer of little trees and stuff that live back
here in the background. As things get closer to
you in the landscape, you want to get darker,
and darker, so we just add a little more brown to that same color. Load the fan brush back
up. These trees in my mind are a little closer so we're
gonna see a little more detail. Take the corner of the
brush, just the corner, and begin working down the tree. Down, down, down, like
that. Just like that. We just put in a few
little indications here. Corner of the brush. As you
work down, apply more pressure. You're bending the bristles
downward. Forcing them downward. There. Okay. Let's have one more, what the heck. Just make a little clump of trees here. And, maybe, in our world,
you're right. There's one. You just decide where
they live. Drop 'em in. Drop 'em in. There's another one. Turn the brush over, use the other side. You can use both sides.
We're not concerned in here. All we're looking for is
basic shape. Basic shape. Maybe there's a big one that lives here. Big ole, strong tree. There he comes. They live right here in your fan brush. Sometimes you have to
sort of scare 'em out. There we go. It's working so
well, no use stopping now. Once again, you decide how
many trees live in your world. Here's little bushy areas back here. Take that same color
on the knife, and just put the indication of
little things that are happening in between. This is how you turn a few
trees into a lot of trees. There we go. Now, we're not sure how many
trees live in that clump. Same thing over here. Just here and there. Tell you what, let's go
to the two-inch brush. We're going to some brown,
a little white in it. Maybe in our world, this comes ... Yep. Yep, you're right. Right over like that. We'll need a little place
for all those little trees to stand. And there it is. About like that. Okay, while we got that ole
brush going, I'm gonna get into a little yellow, get a
little sap green on the brush. Same ole brush, I haven't cleaned it. I want to colors to
stay in the earth tones, so I don't want to get them too dark. I want them light, airy. When you do yours, you
decide what color you want. Let's go back up in here. Same ole brush. We'll just tap in some nice
little highlights on this. Just nice little highlights. Yellow ochre, indian yellow, cadmium
yellow, little sap green. Just whatever. You make the decision. There. I know, I know. I know, I know. Sometimes you see things. If you have this little
opening right here, you'd have to put a
little cabin, right there. Now scrape out a basic little shape. There. And we scrape it
just to remove excess paint. Give us a general idea
of where we're going. And we'll take a little
brown, and let's begin. Let's begin figuring out
all of our little angles. There we are. Tchoom! Over on this side, maybe it
comes out here, like that. I don't know. It's up to you. Down under here. Tchoom. Here we are. And then down, tchoom. At this point, you're not committed. I know. Maybe ... Yep, let's get crazy. Maybe there's a little, maybe
a little shed on this cabin. You need a place to put
your tools. Right there. Or your fish and tackle. I'd rather put my fish
and tackle in there. All right. We'll take a little brown, let's get some bright red. Nice color. Just makes you feel
good. Bright red, white, a little of that brown we made. Don't over mix it. Leave it
marbel-ley, if that's a word. Cut off a little row of paint. Let;s go up here, and
just let that bounce, right down the side.
[soft clicking sounds] So it looks like, maybe,
old shingles that are falling off the roof. Times are hard out here. Real hard. There. I like to make old
buildings and stuff that look like they've had a rough life. There. Okay. Maybe, I'll tell you
what. Take a little white, a little of the brown,
without the red in it. And with that, Tchoom! Just put the indication
of some highlights there. And, a little bit more in there. Making the front a little
brighter, so it stands out. Wipe off the ole knife, and you take a little of that brown paint on the edge of the knife,
and just make it look like old boards that live in there. See there? Just old boards. Now, back to our roof
color, and let's put a roof right here on this little shed,
see? [soft clicking sounds] Gotta make those little
noises, or it doesn't work. Just brown and white again. Tchoom. Leave a little bit out
there. tchoom-tchoom-tchoom. We'll put some little
board in there like that. Shoot, that's about to give
us a basic little shape there. About there, and you can
just use he brush to cut off wherever you want it. Like there. Tell you what, let's take a little brown, on the small edge of the knife. Tchoom. Just put a little window in
there. Maybe one right there. That easy. That easy. All right. Back to all
of our little colors. Just begin working it down like that. Take the ole two-inch brush,
little bit of that brown on it, and here and there we can just
tap in using the top corner. Indication of some little
bushes that live in there. Wherever. Wherever. There. Very soft, very gentle. Now then. Back to my brush that has some
of that brown we made on it. Let's pull it straight down. Tchoom. We'll make a little reflection
right there in the water. Straight down. It's most important that it goes straight
down. And then go across. It creates that illusion of a reflection that lives right there. That easy. That easy. Well, while we got that
ole brown brush going here, you ready? Maybe in our world there lives just a big ole ... Ooh there goes a nice evergreen. But it's not wasted, because
we learned how to make 'em. Any time you learn, it
certainly is not failure. There, all right. See? Just use the top
corner of that ole brush. We can tap an indication here and there. Just a big ole tree that lives out here. Down in here, I'm gonna
go into a little bit of the midnight black. I want it to be darker in here. Deep shadow. Deep shadow in there. Maybe it comes all the way down. I don't know, you make
the decision. There. Let's bring it all the
way down into the front. It's our world, and we
can do anything here that we want to do. This is that brown we made
with just a little black in it, to darken it. All right. In this painting, one
thing I like about it, is it uses a very limited palette. By limited palette, that
means very, very few colors. Very few colors. It's not
something that you have to have a million colors to do. There. You can do this one. Very easy. I'm gonna take a liner brush. going to a little bit
of dark with one side, and, let's see. Let me get a
little liquid white up here. Okay, a little of the dark color. Then one side of it only, throw
a little bit of light color. We can go in here, and this
just creates the indication of little stones. Thin paint. And it just like we do
with a little filbert, only you can do it with the liner, and it looks like little stones
that live all back in here. Tiny little things. There. Okay, let's take a ... Well I
got a number 3 fan brush here. We'll load one side with dark. Then I'll come right
over here, get a little of the light color. On one side only. So, you've got light, dark. Let's go up in here. Maybe we can make out the indication of a few little tree trunks
that live back in here. Just here and there, there's a few. Just a few little happy things. Back to our liner brush, and
I'm adding paint thinner. Cause a thin paint, as you know, will go over the top of the thick paint, without mixing so bad. Turn that brush. It brings it to a nice, sharp point. Holds a lot of paint. See
there? You can see it. Now, with that, we can go back in here, and put the indication of a
few old limbs and branches that live out there in
our world. Just a few. Here and there. Some of them
show, some of them don't. It's up to you. Shoot, I'll just use a ole two-inch brush, it doesn't make any difference.
Whatever works for you. Little bit of green, sap
green. Little bit of yellow. Little yellow ochre, but
mostly in the yellows. Okay let's go up in here. Maybe back in here we'll
just have an indication of just a few highlights
in some of these trees. We don't want much, this
is in the background. Just a few little things.
Few little things. All right. That's probably
about enough of that, 'cause I want to put some trees,
I think, in the foreground. Get a little paint thinner in
there. I want to thin that. Let's go into some yellow.
We'll use some cadmium yellow. All right. See, all I'm
doing is tapping the corner. You can see it very close.
That's a beautiful close-up shot. Thanks, Kathy. All right, let's go right up in here. And maybe right up in
here lives a little bush. If you have trouble
making the paint stick, all you need to do is add a
little bit of paint thinner. A little bit of paint thinner. Doesn't take much. Or liquid white. So you can dip it in the liquid white. liquid white, let's just do it. It'll make it a little
bit brighter. There. All right. I think it's time
for a bravery test [chuckle]. You ready? All right let's go. Let's go into straight brown.
That brown that we made. I want to put a little black in there too. I want it dark and strong.
A lot of paint on the brush. All right, here's your
bravery test. Tchoom! Ooh. That's scary isn't
it? Isn't that scary. Worked on it so long, and so hard, and some crazy guy tells you
just to draw a big ole tree. Right there. Two of 'em. I like two. He needs a friend. There. All right. We'll take a
little touch of the white. And light seems to be coming
from the left in this painting, so we'll take, and give it a little pull. Make this a little birch tree.
Something about like that. Titanium white, you can
put a little brown in it if you want to. Just so it follows along with everything else in the painting. Little bit on this tree, here we go. There. And sometimes you can
see a little reflected light on the other side, it's okay. You can make it any way you want it. Now, back to our liner brush.
Little bit of the brown. Needs to be very, very thin though. So it'll flow right across there. Lot of paint in the brush. All right, let's go up in here. Maybe there's a big
ole limb that lives ... Yep, you're right. Right
out here. There we go. Let's see, this one
needs an arm on him, too. We don't want him left out. Little ole tree's gotta
have an arm on him. Reach up here, gather the sunlight. Birds' gotta have a place to sit too. Shoot, you don't want them
out here with no place to sit. All right. And when you do yours, you put as many limbs on
your tree as you want. I think today, I'll
use the ole oval brush. We'll put a little sap green on it. Maybe even a little of that
brown to dull it, okay? And we'll go into our yellows. Here it is. There. Little green, little
yellow. Yellow ochre. All the yellows. Give it a little push. It loads a little ridge
of paint right on the end. We can go up in here, and
we just touch the canvas. Tap in the indication
of some little leaves that live out here. There, see? You decide where and how many. All right. Super little thing,
that's all there is to it. Little oval brush works so
good for these kind of things. Now, we can go right back in. I'm gonna use the old two-inch brush. That's working pretty good put
a little paint thinner on it. Just the top corner. Let's put the indication here
and there, and there and here. Get a little red in there, too, of just some little bushes
that live all down here. Do one little bush at a
time, don't get in a hurry. One little bush at a time. Just
let these little rascals go. There's another one. See,
by doing one at a time, it creates the illusion
of depth and distance in your painting. Add a
little sap green in there. Make a little darker color
with this right in there. Something like so. And this is a good way to clean
up the foots of those trees. You just put a little
bush in front of them, and then they fit. Then they fit. Let's have some fun today. Every once in a while
you need to get crazy. Put a little liquid white on the canvas. There. Maybe, and I'm
really not a floral painter, but maybe there's few
little daisies out here. We need Annette here to paint florals. Our partner, Annette, is one
of the best floral painters in the country. I'm gonna get her on here one day. We'll have her just do some flowers. Let you see how easy they can be. There. All right! You put as many as you want in there. Just some little indications, though. Look like little daisies or
somethin' that live out here. And these are so simple to do. Anybody can do these little rascals. And we'll take a little red
and yellow, mix it together. Make it look like orange. We just touch each one
right in the center. Give the indication of a little
center button in daisies. Little bit of brown, here and there. We can put in some sticks, and twigs. Somethin' about like that. And you can always take the
knife and cut in the sticks, just by scraping through the paint, wherever you think they should live. Shoot, I think we about got a
little finished painting here. So a very simple little
painting, and on the oval, It makes it very unique. It's a wonderful gift to give
to friends and relatives. Hope you try this one. You'll
enjoy it, make you happy. We'll sign it, call it complete. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting. Thank you for being with us
today, and God bless, my friend. [Light jazz music]
