- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us
today. Let's do a fantastic
little painting together. So tell you what, let's start
out and have them run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint along
with us. And they'll come across, as
usual, In the same order as I
have them on the palette, starting with the white
and working around. While they're doing that, let me show you what
I've got done up here. I have my standard old
pre-stretched, double-prime canvas up here. I use an 18 by 24, but you use whatever size is convenient. Now, today I've covered the
entire canvas with a thin, and let me say that
again, a thin, thin even coat of liquid
clear. Now when you're using this
clear, I say thin several times because you need such a very, very small
amount. It's transparent, you can't see
it. There's a tendency to put too
much on. Very little. Okay, and with that, let's
just have a good time today. I'm gonna take little yellow
ochre maybe. Little bit of yellow ochre. Let's just do a winter scene
today that's very nice. I'll be right back, let me get a
little, little dark sienna mixed in with
it. A little winter scene that is
warm. Let's go up here. Sometimes winter scenes
can become so cold, they're almost unpleasant. So let's do one today that has a
lot of just beautiful little
things happening in it. And we just start out and use a two-inch brush and just make little circles
and little patterns, just let all these little
things just happen. There you go. This is a time to have fun. Just enjoy this. Let it work and play. But try not to, I don't want to have just
a dead old flat sky today. I want to have something that
has movement and life in it, and is
interesting, and it's fun. So by doing these little
circles, going one way a while, then
go the other way a while. Look at what happens. Look at all the forms and
shapes that are happening. Just automatically. Okay, a little more color. Put a little over in here. There. And try not to stay in one
area and keep working it. Because it'll just look like
it's dead. It's not interesting. There we are. And this clear does not dilute
the color. If you had liquid white on the
canvas like we'd normally use, it would dilute the color, because it would blend with it. And the white would continually
mix. And today I thought we'd just do
something where we don't mix color. Alright. Maybe just a touch more color. We put a little something
right up in here. Alright, boy that is a fantastic
way of making a very effective
little sky. Now then. Now comes the fun part. Let's wash the old brush. If you've painted with me
before, you know that's the most
interesting part of this whole technique. And we wash our brushes, as
usual, with odorless paint thinner. Just shake off the excess and, cover everybody in about
a two-block radius. When you're doing this at home, you might want to get a
little brush beater rack that you put down in the bottom of a waste paper basket, and it'll save your happy home. Okay, now. I'm just gonna take a little
bit of titanium white, right on that same old two-inch
brush. Just a little, we don't need
much. And let's go up in here. And let's just start, maybe
this'll be our light area. And let's just sort of bounce
that around. Just bounce it around, let it
play. There. I'm using just the corner
of the brush, though. Okay now. Sometimes it's nice to leave the
sky like we had it a minute ago. Sometimes it's nice to take like
this and add highlights to it. It's up to you. This piece of canvas is truly
your world, and you can do anything
here that makes you happy. It's such a fantastic day here, I thought I'd put a little
bright spot in the sky, and I hope the painting brings a little brightness to
your life when you do it. But we don't need a great deal, I just want a little. Because I don't want to lose all
these beautiful patterns that we have
up here. There, a little more white, you can make this as
bright as you want it, and the more you blend it, of
course, the more the dark sienna and
yellow ochre will mix in there and dilute it. Okay. Maybe just the least
little touch right in here. Just so there's a little
contrast in there. Maybe in our world, there's
a little bit of light that zings right through
that little cloud. Okay. Now then, very lightly. Two hairs and some air, we can just blend that out. Alright. And that makes a very good, very effective little sky that you can do in just
a couple of minutes. And once again, we get
to wash the old brush. Alright. Okay. I tell you what let's do. Let's mix up, let's make
a little lavender color. We'll use a little alizarin
crimson, a little touch of phthalo blue. Proportionately, much, much much
much much more of the blue than
crimson. Okay, and we'll put a
little white out here. And dilute that color down. Just value it down. Ooh, that's a nice lavender
color. Alright, we'll grab the
old two-inch brush here. Let's just take a two-inch
brush and tap the corner. I'm just gonna tap the corner,
see? Right into a little bit of that
color. We're not getting a great
deal of paint on the brush. We'll go up in here, and maybe in our world there
lives just the indication of some
very, very soft little bushes back in here. And all we're using is the top
corner of the two-inch brush, and with this we can form basic
shapes. And that's all we're looking
for. I don't want these to be too
distinct, because then they'll look
like they're too close to us. I want these to be far
back in the distance. Very basic little shapes. Alright, very good. Something about like that. And wherever you think they
should be. And you can vary these a little
bit, some of them be a little
darker than others, and the ones that are lighter
like that, when the painting is
finished, will look like they're much much farther away. So if you put one in front
of it that's a little darker, it'll help strengthen that
illusion. Alright. Sometimes we can even take the
brush and just push sideways like
that. It'll make it look like a little
tree that's far back in there. There we go. Little bit more of the color. Put a little darker one
right here in the foreground. Whatever you want. Just let your imagination
go when you're doing these. Okay. Now sometimes, I'll
show you a little trick. Let me show you something
that's a great deal of fun. Okay, let me get a clean brush. Sometimes it's fun to just dip just the corner of the
brush, just the corner, into a little paint thinner. Because we have liquid clear up
here, paint thinner and liquid clear have almost a violent reaction when you put them together. And you can take and just flick a little paint thinner on
there, just like so. Let me get just a touch more. And you can do this with
a fan brush or whatever. But everywhere that paint
thinner touches, it'll begin to remove the paint. That means little dots will
appear, and it looks like little leaves
and stuff that are way back here on your little trees and all that. But it's just a very neat little
way of making a lot of effects very quickly, very easily. And people will go crazy trying to figure out how you've
done this. Okay, but be careful that you
don't get too much paint thinner. There, that should be about
enough for what we're doing. Okay. Isn't that sneaky? But try that, you will
be absolutely amazed, and it takes a couple of
minutes. As this painting progresses, you'll begin to see these
little spots appear. Okay, let's take, put another
layer of little things in there. For that we'll use yellow
ochre, be right back, and dark sienna. Just yellow ochre and dark
sienna mixed together. Like that. Let's go back up here. Now then, right in front of
these lavender little bushes, I'm going to begin to just put an indication of
some happy little things that live right in here that are this color. Just varying the colors
back and forth here. Back and forth. Little Indian yellow here and
there. There. Okay, now I'm gonna go
back to the lavender. And all I'm doing, I'm not
even cleaning the brush, I'm just sort of working back
and forth, so you have all kinds of
different little things happening in here. Add this least little
touch of the cad yellow. This is cadmium yellow. Make that a little bit
brighter, right here. Because here's our light
source, right above it. That way it's a little bit
brighter right in there. Be careful with the cadmium
yellow, it'll eat up your whole
world here in a minute. We don't want too much of it. Going back to the lavender
color. And if lavender and yellow get
together, it just makes brown, and in this painting, that's
wonderful. We don't mind at all. Don't mind at all. There. Now then. There's one that's a little bit
lighter. But see all the different layers that you can create? Just with the top point
of a great big old brush. Little touch of more of
the Indian yellow there. That's gorgeous. Maybe, maybe back here in our world, let's have a few little tree
branches and sticks and twigs, and for that, we'll just use
that same lavender color, what the heck. You can use anything that you
like. But think we'll just use that
lavender. A little paint thinner, go into
that, turn the brush. That brings it to a nice sharp
point, loads the bristles full of
paint. Okay? Now, maybe in our world, there lives a little
tree right back there. There. Put some arms on him. There we go. Little sticks and twigs. Just wherever you think they
should be. Let your imagination take you
anywhere that you want to go. There we are. And put them in the different
layers, so that they layer all
in different planes. That helps separate the
different
planes in your painting. Get a touch more of the paint
thinner. Maybe, yep, let's put
a big one right here. Now the paint thinner's gonna
react against the liquid clear
that's on the canvas, and these will start turning
whitish. So they'll look like they're
highlighted without you hardly doing a
thing. It will take a few minutes
for that to happen. As the paint thinner and
the clear begin to react. Use this reaction to your
advantage. You can make some fantastic
things. A little darker color. Who knows, maybe there's a, oh there we are, oh that one, it goes right over like that. If you've painted with me
before, you know I don't like all my
trees to just be perfectly straight, I like trees that have
character. I like trees that are like
people. They're all different,
and they're all wonderful. There we are. You just sometimes have
to look for the good, but it's there. Always there. Alright. Maybe on the other side, we'll have a couple over here. I'm gonna add the least little
touch of dark sienna to that too. So we just change the
flavor a little maybe. Or you could add a little of
the Van Dyke brown, whatever. Just so we have some variety
here. I don't want all my little
trees to look exactly the same. There's one. And however many you want. We could even take a little
of the titanium white and thin it down, and here and
there, you have one that's white. Because there are always a lot
of little white sticks and twigs in the
woods. Okay, good. Now then. Maybe down in here,
tell you what let's do, let's take a little of
that alizarin crimson, a little phthalo blue, I'm
just making some more lavender is all I'm doing. I'm just making it on the brush, because I'm about out. And let's just put some color
down here. Right on top of the clear. This will just end up being, maybe we'll have snow
and this will be shadows. Or if you wanted to have water, this could end up being your
water. But I think today I'll
just have some snow there. We'll grab another two-inch
brush, and we'll go into just
pure titanium white, nothing else. Pure old titanium white. And we'll start back here, and just begin laying in some
snow. I'm gonna bring this
snow all the way up here, and while I'm doing that, I wanna share with you one of the most fantastic little
creatures that you've ever seen. Because this'll all be just the
same. This is a little deer that Diana Schafer there
brought, brought here to the station for
us to see. She's the bird lady here in
Muncie. This deer was found
right outside of Muncie, in a farmer's field. And it had been orphaned, and Diana has raised this little
deer, and today it's been set free, and he really is doing
fantastic. But I had such a good time
with this little fella. I spent several hours
just playing with him, and I thank Diana for
sharing that with us. He is absolutely gorgeous. We didn't even name him. But it always looks like Bambi
to me when I see a little deer. Isn't he something? That has to be one of the
most gorgeous creatures God has ever made. I'd like to take him home
and just keep him as a pet. But that's not what he's meant
to be. He's meant to be free. So I say he's already been
turned loose. This was shot about three months
ago. There. But isn't he the most
beautiful little thing? I get to watching the deer, I have a monitor here. I get watching the deer and quit
painting. Anyway, all I'm doing here is
just taking titanium white. Pay attention to the angles,
though. Angles are very important
when you're doing snow. All I wanna do is make it look
like there's a little place
right in here, like that. And by paying attention to the
angles, see how easy that is to do? And already, you see
the illusion of distance coming through here. There we are. Okay. Okay, we can take, we'll use a fan brush, what the
heck. And we'll get some of those same
colors. Dark sienna, yellow ochre. A little bit of cad yellow,
little Indian yellow. Just mix them together. I always like to mix color on
the brush, that way you have a variety
of colors on the brush. It's just not one dead old
color. And we go up here, and here and there and there and
here. I'm gonna add a little
white, that's too dark. Oh that's much better. There. See, now we can begin putting
some little, little things here, that
breaks up that straight line, looks like little weeds that
are growing right out here, just push up with the fan brush, all you have to do. Just push up with the fan brush. There. Wherever you think they should
be. Now we'll take another fan
brush, and I have several going. Just plain titanium white. And we can clean these
edges up right here, just grab it, pull it, be sure to follow the same
angles though. But that easy. Snow is one of the easiest
things to paint in this method. No problem. When I was a traditional
painter, I used to labor over things like
snow and reflections. My gosh, reflections
are one of those things that just drove you crazy. In this technique, it is
absolutely the easiest thing there is to
do. There. And then we can take a little bit more of
that lavender that we had on the liner brush, and maybe here and there, put the indication of some
little sticks and twigs that live right out in here. They don't all live in the
background, some live up here, a little
closer. Okay. Shoot, you know me. You know me. This is such a beautiful spot. I'd have to have me a
little cabin out here, and this is where I'd like to
stay. You could stay out here and
watch that little deer grow up. Alright. Let's start with a little
bit of Van Dyke brown on the knife, the first decision we have to
make is where is our cabin gonna
live. I think today we'll put a
little cabin right here. Start a little Van Dyke brown, and we'll paint the back eve
of the little cabin first. Then we'll load the knife
full of titanium white, and there's snow on our roof, so we'll put in the
other side of the roof. That easy. Maybe our cabin's gonna be about there. And see how easy it is? Just drop that little
rascal right in there. Now, we just come back, and we'll put some wood
in here for the front, and I'm just still using Van
Dyke brown, this is just a base color. We'll come back and
highlight it a little bit. Just touch and pull. Touch it and pull. All we're doing is just
blocking in color right here. Okay, a little bit right here. There we are. Now I'm gonna take white and dark sienna, and a
little bit of the Van Dyke all mixed together. But not overmixed, I want
it left marbled like that. A very small level of paint, then we can go up here, and with no pressure,
just touch and pull down. No pressure though, no pressure. Absolutely no pressure. Let the paint break. Make the wood look old. Then you can play back and
forth. You want a little shadow up
here? You take a little dark, pull down, see there. That wood looks so old, it's
unreal. Now maybe take some more
of the Van Dyke brown. Maybe we have, in our cabin, maybe there's a door right
there. Gotta have a way to get in. Maybe this is a spectacular
cabin, maybe it has a window right
here. And we can do that. Just take a little of the brown,
lay in. Shoot, who knows. Take the small knife,
it's just the right size. Over here, maybe there's another
window. We can have as many windows in
our cabin as we want, shoot. Take a little light color, just sorta outline this so it
stands out. There. Okay. Same over here, just a little
highlight so it looks like a little
light's playing across the window there. Shoot, you can even get crazy
and put curtains in there if you want to. Now then, we can take
a little Van Dyke brown and make the indication of old
boards just by touching. Just by touching. Now, time to get our proportions
correct. So we just take the knife and do a cabinectomy. See, you can cut that old cabin
off anywhere you want it. Just like so. Fan brush, a little bit of
titanium white, and we can bring that
snow right up to the door. Right up to the door. Sometimes it's nice, if you wanna be sneaky,
take a touch of that little dark lavender here, little bit, make the indication, maybe somebody's walked in and
out of here a couple times. Just the indication of a little
path that goes up in there. There haven't been many people
here, so I don't want to do, I don't want to do a whole
bunch. If you had a lot of people
living here, then that little deer would go
away. And we want to keep him. Alright, let's take a
little bit of dark sienna, a little bit of yellow ochre, tap it together here. And let's go right up in here, right up here, and just tap in the indication
of some little bushes that live on this side. There we are. See? Maybe they come, I don't know, maybe this little bush
comes right down here. This guy, maybe he's like me, and he doesn't cut the yard very
often, and it's growing up over. There. I'm not a very good yard keeper. Okay, tell you what let's do. Maybe over here on the other
side, we need something to fill this
up. Let's just take, still just using the top corner of the old two-inch brush. You can do fantastic things
with very few brushes if you just practice and
make friends with them a little bit. Now I'm going back to the yellow
ochres, Indian yellow, a little touch
of cad yellow here and there. And also, here and there, a little bit of titanium white, just so you can see different
layers, just to lighten. Something like so. Maybe down like that. When you do yours, just sort of look at it, and you'll see things happening
in it. Use those little things that
happen, don't fight them. Take a little white on the
two-inch brush. Put a little indication
of snow right there. There. See, and it'll push
all that back in there. Same thing on the other side, maybe this snow bank comes right
down, like that. Who knows. Only you do. Only you do, in your world, you're the only one who knows. Okay, good. Okay, see there? That easy. And then like before, we can
take the little fan brush and just
tap in some little grassy areas that're
living right out here. Some over on this side, too. Just a few. Another fan brush with white, just like before, clean up the
bottom. And a little over here. Alright. I think it's time to have some
fun. You know me. I like those big trees. Let's go into Van Dyke brown,
dark sienna, just mix them together on the
brush, it doesn't matter. And maybe in our world, here we go. I get letters sometimes, people
say, "you had the most beautiful
painting, and then you put that big old
tree in it, and I don't like it anymore." But when you do your painting, that's the beauty of this. If you don't want a
big tree in your world, leave it out. That's the beauty. That's why we don't do any
tracings here or we don't do any drawing. When we're teaching our
instructors, that's one of the things
that we emphasize, we want to teach people
creativity, not just to copy. Not just to copy, that's
very important to me, that you learn creativity, because it makes you feel good
in here. We'll take a little dark sienna, and white, mostly white, and just tap right along this
edge here, and put the indication
of a little hightlight on this old tree. But I like to tap this
because it looks fuzzy, and to me a lot of times,
especially evergreens, look fuzzy, and the edges
and the bark are all ragged. If you want a straight tree,
just pull it straight down and make it with a knife. I just happen to like those kind
of trees. Now, paint thinner. Get a little more paint thinner. Go right into those same two
browns. Make the paint thin like ink. And let's go right up in here, and maybe in our tree,
there's a big old limb, hangs right down like that. There he is. See? Putting some little arms out
here. Maybe this is an old evergreen
tree. And they have just a lot
of little sticks and twigs and things that hang off of
them. There. Okay, see all those little
rascals? Maybe there's a big old
limb, lives right there. But think like a tree
when you're doing this. If you were a tree, where
would you want an arm? Maybe something like so. As many or as few as you want. There, look at all them old
rascals. Maybe this one comes up and goes
around. Whatever. But isn't that a
fantastic little painting? It's a good way to use the
liquid clear. Try it. I think you'll really enjoy it. And from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy
painting and God bless, my friend. (cheerful music)
