- Hi, welcome back. Today I thought we'd do a little seascape that's right off of the California Oregon Coast. I've taken the liberty because we do have time restraints here of going ahead and covering a black canvas with transparent color. Now, what I've done in the center here I've put Alizarin Crimson right in the center, and going out in both directions, and around that Phthalo Blue, and on the bottom the same thing, so we have a circle here of Crimson protruding in both directions, and Blue around the edges, okay? Now, let's take the one-inch brush, and a little bit of Titanium White paint. Let's figure out here where we want the sun to be. We're gonna start, say, right about here, and we make little tiny X's, or crisscross strokes, and just begin working them out never going back toward the center always working outward because you're gonna soon be picking up the Blue color. Let that run right on out like so, there we go. See now how it's picking up the Blue. Now let me clean the brush, and we can brighten it up just a little bit more. A little more Titanium White. Be sure your brush is clean and dry right into the center working outward. There we go. Look at that son of a gun shine now. Work it all the way out to the outside edges here. Now with a large brush we're gonna go in and blend this still making the crisscross strokes. There we go, gentle just let it go back and forth just to blend the colors together. Now very carefully take the brush marks out. Let's wash this old big brush out. There we go. Now if you wanted to make it a little bit brighter we can add just the slightest amount of Cad Yellow and White. Now you have to be very careful with this because if the Yellow touches the Blue we've got a Green sky, so all we want to do is right around in here put a little bit of Yellow, just a tiny bit. There, that's enough because we're getting very close to the Blue. Now, once again, with a large brush we'll blend this out. Take out the brush strokes, and we've got the beginnings of a beautiful little sunset here. Let's use the Fan Brush, and we'll take some Van Dyke Brown, and add it to a little bit of Alizarin Crimson. Brown and Alizarin Crimson. We'll make some happy little clouds floating around up here in the sky, so let's go right along here. We'll start with a little cloud coming right across the sun maybe. There we go. Push this paint into the canvas, really work it. Maybe there's a big old cloud up here. Clouds are very free. Just let them float and have fun. There we go. One of the freest things in nature. There's a little one here. Once again, just sort of let your imagination go crazy, and wherever you see a little cloud just drop it in. This is your world, your sunset. Maybe there's another one right in here. And maybe up in here, there we go. Have a big old dark one, it's just hiding up here. Okay, that gives you some basic cloud shapes to work with. Now we need to highlight these happy little clouds, and let some sunlight play on them. So let's take a little bit of Yellow. This is Cad Yellow, and the smallest amount of Permanent Red. Just mix them together here. There we go. We'll make you some bright, sparkly little clouds. A lot of paint on the Fan Brush. Now, just right above the dark touch the canvas. Maybe a tiny bit more of the Permanent Red in there. We'll brighten him up a little. Just touch the canvas, and lay a little bit of this color right on top of the dark. Just push it off the Fan Brush. There we go. Little things happen in some of these clouds. This one will be highlighted on the bottom since the light source is below it. Don't let that little rascal fool you. We'll put some light down here. Maybe there's just a little trickle hitting up on top of this cloud somewhere. Just here and there little tiny bits. Then we have this big dark one that's hiding way up here, so we'll put some little highlights on him too. Don't want this one as bright. See he's farther away from the light source. There we go. Now let's see, you can with a big brush all we're gonna do is just gently wipe across this, and watch what happens. Just bring all this together. There we go. Look at those son of a guns. Isn't that something? You can fluff them up, move them around. But you must have a paint that's very firm that's underneath. If you using, again, a lot of paint you become a mud mixer. Okey-dokey. Nice simple, very effective little sky. Let's move right along here. We'll take a little bit of Titanium White with a least little touch of Cad Yellow in it. A very, very small amount, and figure out where your water line is gonna be here. Maybe right about here we'll just begin by touching the canvas. Just touch, allow the paint to be pulled off onto the canvas. Start under the sun and work outward, so automatically it gets darker as it goes out. This line needs to be pretty straight. If this gets crooks and bumps in it it will sort of bother you. We'll lay a little color right here. A little bit of a light is just reflecting through the water. There we go. Just let it play and have fun. Now we need the big brush, and very gently we're just gonna blend right across this, and bring it together. There we go. Clean up our brush here. That is fun, that's better than arguing with your spouse. Take the almighty Fan Brush, and I'll put a little tiny bit of Magic White with it, the tiniest little bit. Okay, now, we're gonna begin making some little wave actions in here, so just touch, and then once in a while give it a little push, so it bends upward. A tiny little push. You want it to bend upward, though. You see how it picks up the Crimson that's underneath, and makes all those pretty little things happen automatically. You don't have to worry about them. There we go. Just let it get darker and darker toward the edges over here. We're beginning to see some little things happen, so you can put a little more detail in some of these waves. You can see now it's beginning to pick up the Blue that's underneath there. What a super way to make little waves. Well, if we're gonna make a California Oregon type seascape here let's start putting some little rocks in the water maybe way back here. There's a little stone out here in the water, or it's really a big stone that's far away, but it looks small perspective. Let's highlight this with some Burnt Umber, and the least little touch of Yellow in it. A very, very small amount of Yellow in it. There we go. Just barely touch it, just let the paint break. Now then we can splash some water upon that rock. We'll take the Fan Brush again, a little bit of the Magic White with it to thin it, and we'll just begin bringing some water right up here, and let it hit and splash, and have fun and sort of give it a little pull upward. Let's have another little rock in there. Maybe he comes right along here, like that. There we go. This is just Van Dyke Brown with a little of Burnt Umber in it. Okay, and we'll lay some highlights on that one, the same color. Burnt Umber with a little bit of Yellow. Just here and there. Then maybe this ones a little bigger. Maybe there's a little grass that grows out there. We need to have some vegetation on these rocks. They're quite large, so we'll make a little Sap Green and Yellow, and a little tiny bit of Permanent Red in it just to dull it down a little, and then just pop some little grassy things out here on this. There, don't want them too bright. Don't want them too bright. Be careful they don't get so bright you can't stand them. Want to keep it quite dark. Got behind in my brush cleaning. Now, I'll take a little Van Dyke Brown, and the Burnt Umber just mixed on the Fan Brush here. Let's put a few little trees back here on this one. All we're gonna do is just touch. All we're looking for is silhouettes, so just touch here and there. There we go, just a few little happy things. I'll use the Liner Brush with a little bit of thin oil in it, and just turn that brush until it gets real sharp, there we go. We'll put a few little trunks on those trees. These may be quite hard for you to see, but they are here, and when you do your painting at home you'll want to have all this little detail in here. It really makes the painting stand out. Now, let's highlight those little trees just a tiny bit. We're gonna use a little bit of Ochre with Permanent Red, Yellow Ochre, with a little touch of Permanent Red in it. And just highlight them, just a little, just so they stand out. These trees have quite flat tops on them. There, that's good. A little bit more of the wave action here, just touch, let it bend, push it up that mountain, and let it spin up here right up the rocks. Maybe there's another wave right here. Make little stories up when you're doing this, little sounds, think you're at the ocean. Think of the sounds, how the wave feels, the wind blowing in your face. All these things help put you in the mood to do paintings like these. There we go. Let these little waves happen. Don't let them get too bright on you again. Let's make a bigger stone, same color Van Dyke Brown with Burnt Umber, and maybe this one comes way up like this. Maybe we're up above looking down off one of the big cliffs. There we go. Let's really go crazy. Let's put one out here like so. And just let him wander on down. I'm just filling all this in with Van Dyke Brown, and a little bit of Burnt Umber. This painting is a little different than things we've done in the past, but it gives you a whole new bunch of ideas to go with. Always look for new ways to do this. All we want to do here is give you the basic technique, and turn you loose on the world. But always believe in yourself, and believe in your ability of what you can do. There we go, all that's covered now in just Brown. Let's put a few little highlights in here. This is Burnt Umber with Yellow, and a little touch of Permanent Red in it. Let's turn this into some almighty big stones here. Just let that paint run down there and break. That's what I mean by breaking is when the paint has all the holes and stuff in it. Just let it come down here and play. There, look at all those things happening. Right here maybe a little light striking, and it's playing through here. Mix up just a touch more color here. A little bit of Permanent Red in it. A little bit of light on this stone over here. There we go, just let these things happen. Okay, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe there's a little light right there. There, look at that. You can do it. All right. Now let's take a little Crimson and a little bit of Van Dyke Brown, and just put some pretty little bushes, and stuff up here. Maybe there's a little plant that lives right here, and the trees that live here really catch the devil. All of the wind beats on them all the time, so they're scrawny little trees. Oh, they've been hurt, look at there. Flatten the tops out. There, maybe there's one back in here that grows on the ground, too. And maybe up here. I have a big tall one up here in the sky. Let's see, we'll take a little bit of Yellow, a little bit of Magic White, Permanent Red and then we'll go right into the Burnt Umber to make a dark Reddish Brown color, and with that I'm gonna start highlighting some of these. Gently touch the canvas. Look at all those pretty colors that happen automatically. Okay, maybe there's one up here. Don't let it get too bright. Go all the way to the top. Remember where your light is coming from. You want those sides to be brighter. There we go. A little bit right here. There we are. There we go. Let's take, and wash out a Fan Brush here, and we'll begin putting some trunks on these trees. We'll use a Van Dyke Brown, and Burnt Umber. Very dark, and with the Fan Brush use this sideways. All we do here is touch, and gently begin pulling in our general shapes. Isn't that something? Okay, put a little down here. Maybe it comes down. Oh, poor old tree, poor old tree, rough life. They're all bent up. Maybe if we can see a little bit of a stem back in here. Now I'll take a lighter color. This is some of the Umber Yellow I had left, and highlight one side. Pull it down like so. Just follow the curvature. Just follow the curvature of the tree. Now, very gently take the brush, and begin working that over, so it gives a round appearance to the tree. Just barely touch it and pull it. There we go. We'll just come right down here, and use some Sap Green, and a little bit of Yellow and Permanent Red, and we'll just make some little grassy areas all around in here just using the Fan Brush. Let is bounce and play. You're gonna pick up the dark color that's underneath, and automatically this is gonna get darker in value for you. Let it happen, don't fight it. Let all these little things happen. Learn to use them. Maybe there's grass and stuff that comes right down here. Remember, this is your world. You make all the decisions. Look at that. Let's see here. Let's clean this up a little bit, like so. Then we'll put a happy little bush in the front of the tree, so it sits down in there. There we go. Now we'll highlight those little bushes, and I'll use some Permanent Red, a little touch of Yellow, and some Magic White. Put a little Permanent Red in there. I still don't want it to get bright, so I'll add just a touch of this Umber color to it to dull it down, and just touch. Don't let it smear. Touch, bend the bristles, get away from it. Maybe there's a happy little bush lives right here. Wherever you want a little bush just drop one in. There we go. Now we can take the knife, cut in a few little sticks here and there. Just make that stone come down a little sharper. There we go. Just a few little touches. At home you have unlimited time you can play with this put in tremendous detail. Here we're sort of limited so we have to just try to give you an idea, and let you take it from there. Put your dream on canvas. Take a little more of the grass color here, and brighten up this little corner, but it's absolutely unreal what can be done on these black canvases. All the colors that we put underneath here were transparent colors, so it still looks black until you begin applying color to it. Once you begin applying color then the base colors that you put on the transparent colors begin picking up and showing all the beautiful detail. So we could put a few more little details here and there if you wanted to very quickly. Maybe there's a little tree right over here in the dark side. Things like, yes, this is the kind of things you can do at home when you have all this due time, and you can just play. Ooh, that is a nice one. Then we can highlight him a little bit. Just a little. Wow, okay, now I think I'm starting to piddle. You know, one of the hardest things in the world is to figure out when to stop, so I think I'm about ready to stop. Okay, we'll take the Liner Brush, put a small amount of oil on it, bring it to a nice sharp point, and turn that brush when you're doing that, turn it. People seem to have such difficulty signing the painting. Turn it, and we'll sign this one. There we go. Once again, it's nice to have a very short name. I can sign these paintings on the air for you so you can see them being signed, but I think this painting is finished, and I'm gonna stop piddling with it right now. Next week have a White canvas ready, and we'll do a fantastic scene using a White canvas. I sincerely hope you've enjoyed this. Once again, it is something a little bit different, but it does stir the imagination, so with that we'll bring this show to a close. We wish each and every one of you happy painting. God Bless.
