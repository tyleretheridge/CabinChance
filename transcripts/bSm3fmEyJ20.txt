(light jazz music) - Well there. Hi, welcome back, glad
you could join us today. Today I have one of my
little friends here. You know I've got several letters since I've shown these
in the previous shows asking how in the world do you go about feeding a little squirrel. Well it's a very delicate operation. Diana has worked me for a long time. Diana's the bird lady here in Muncie who loaned me this little rascal. And this is how hard it is to
get a little squirrel to eat. That's all there is to it. Aren't they the most
precious little characters you've ever seen? Yeah, poor guy, he hadn't
nothing to eat for years. You could feed 'em 10 times a day, and they'll always be
just about this hungry. Hey, you know I have to go to work, yeah I have to go to work. Okay? All right, I'm gonna
set him right over here and let him finish lunch. And while he's doing that,
we'll just get started. So let's start out and
have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you
need to paint along with us. While they're doing that,
let me grab my pallet here and show you what I've got done up here. I've got my standard ol'
pre-stretched, double-primed canvas and today I've covered
it with a very thin coat of liquid white and liquid
clear mixed together. So you have both of 'em
today, clear and liquid white because I want a translucent effect. So by putting the both on, the liquid white is very opaque, the liquid clear of course is clear. Let's start out today with a
little bit of phthalo blue, just a small amount on
the ol' two inch brush. Just work a little into the bristles. Something about like so,
and we'll go up in here and use our little crisscross
strokes, little x patterns. And we just very quickly put
in a little, a little sky. Very light, I don't want
this to be very dark. Just enough tot sort of tint the sky so we know that it's blue back here. In this particular painting,
the sky's going to be very unimportant, we don't really care. Probably won't even see
much of it when we're done. Thought today we'd do
some, some big trees. Since we have our little squirrel
there that's having lunch, let's have a big tree
that he could play in. There. Something about like that,
that's really all we're looking for today. And that's about all
I'm gonna do for a sky. Something about like that. All right, now then, let's take, I'm gonna mix up a brown made from alizarin crimson and sap green. Maybe just a little
more crimson than green, depending on your taste,
what flavor you want it. Sorta try it and see. 'Cause everybody's different
and you sort of decide if you want yours the reddish
side or to the green side. It's up to you. There. We'll just guess that
that's about right there. Then we wipe the ol' knife off. We just wipe the knife on a paper towel. We'll grab another two inch brush and add a little color to it. And today, today let's
just play, let's just play. Let's take this nice brown
color and start right in here. And let's just, still using
little crisscross strokes, let's just make the indication, okay, we'll go all the way to
the top, what the heck. All I'm looking or here
is some basic shapes. I'm gonna come back and
turn that into a tree, believe it or not. But all we're looking for right here, it's just very basic shapes. I'm gonna add a little black
right down here at the bottom so we have a dark area. That'll end up being the darkest part, that'll be the shadows. There, maybe here and there. Just indication of a little tree. Little bush, whatever. All we're doing in putting
in background shape, we don't care. Cannot make a mistake. We really don't care. There, something, wherever. You just sort of figure
out where they're at and drop 'em in. That's all there is to it. And while we have that
going, shoot, tell you what. Let's just go down here, ooh
I had a little red there. That's all right, doesn't matter. Must not have mixed the color well. So we'll just go ahead
and cover the rest of the, the canvas here with just color, that's all. About like that. There. All right. But that's all there is to
putting in a little background for this particular painting. There. Okay. Then we take out liner brush,
a little paint thinner, a little bit of that same brown color. We want this to be very thin, very, very thin. Something about like that. Almost to the consistency of ink. All right let's go up in here. Now, back in here, there's gonna be a few old tree
trunks and limbs and sticks. Wherever you want 'em, you
decide where they live. If your paint's thin enough though it'll literally just slide right over there. And we're going to put
leaves and stuff in here, so don't worry about a lot of detail. A few of 'em will show
through, but we don't, we don't worry about much. There, see something about like that. And maybe (whistling) right there. Lives another little rascal. Wherever you think they should be. There he comes. Just as many or as few as you want. Like that. Okay, a few little
indications over in here. Once again, I'm not looking
for a lot of detail here. All we're looking for is just indications. This is gonna be in the background, too far away to really worry about it. Too far away. There. See, just an indication. Don't you like that little squirrel? Isn't he a mess? You know it's fantastic,
there's people like Diana Shaffer that I've
mentioned here in Muncie, but people like her all over the country that take care of these animals, injured and orphaned animals. And they do it strictly out of love. There's absolutely no
financial reward to it. In fact most of 'em support
it out of their own pocket. And it's done, it's done strictly and completely out of here. It's just for love of these creatures. And to Diana and all the
people around the country who take care of these
animals, I tilt my hat 'cause I think you're the most
fantastic people there is. All right, I'm gonna use
a little round brush. And we'll go into a
little bit of the yellows, all the yellows, a little
bit of the bright red here and there. Ooh, nice color, but
just tap it to load it. That's all you're doing, just tapping. And by going through these colors, there's actually layers
of colors in your brush. All different colors in there. Okay let's go up in here. Now then comes the fun part. Let's begin picking out our tree. All we need was a little background, now we can go in here
and begin picking out all the little individual shapes that make this tree an individual. This little small round
brush is fantastic. We have a round brush that's
big and one that's small. This is the small one, but
you could use either one, whichever one you have, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. There. Okay, see, but just think
about shape and form here, build individual bushes in there. Now you're sort of seeing
it from a different angle than I am so it might
look a little different. When we get a straight on
shot, it'll look right to you. And we're varying the colors, just sort of varying the
flavors a little bit. There comes one, just pick 'em out. Pick 'em out, pick 'em out, there. They live all back here. All back here, wherever you want 'em. There's a happy little tree. In my world everything's happy. There. Once in a while I'm adding
a little bit of that brown to the color that I used
just to keep it dull. A little bit of the bright red. Up to you, you decide, you decide. All right. And we don't want this one left out, we'll put a little bit over in here. But I'm tapping with the
top corner of the brush, top corner of the brush. There. All right. Hmm, I hear my little squirrel
over there on the other side of the studio, he's still
looking for the rest of his dinner, I don't
think he got it all. And in reality, there's
four squirrels in the box so they wouldn't be lonely. So they're just having
a good time over there looking for lunch. There. All kinds of little bushies. See by varying the flavor
a little bit, or the color, you can make 'em stand
out from one another. Try to leave some dark at the bottom. Try to leave a little
dark down at the bottom. That way the next one will show up. Work in layers, doing the bush or the tree that you think's the farthest away, and work forward, forward, forward. Always working forward. And begin thinking about
the lay of the land, or planes, whatever you wanna
call 'em, it doesn't matter, but the way the land flows. That's what we have to start working on. There. Shoot, let's get this
ol' two inch brush here and go into some nice, same
colors, the yellows and all of those, little bit of
bright red here and there. But just tap. Push, wanna push up that
little ridge of paint. Then we can come back
in here and we can begin laying in little, little indications, once again of the lay of the land. Maybe something about like that. There, but just vary the colors. Maybe this is a little fall scene. There. But isn't that neat? That's all there is to it. Just something about like that. There. See and that dark under color, automatically it picks that
up, so it's bright out here than it is there. Let the canvas and the paint work for you. Shoot, it's the lazy man's
way of painting here. There. I look for ways to make it easier. Let's take a clean brush because we have liquid clear under there and it's transparent, it'll begin looking lighter in color. And if you have a little
paint thinner on your brush, it'll cause the liquid
clear to begin to react. There, 'cause liquid
clear and paint thinner have a violent reaction. There we are. Now we can just use this
brush, what the heck, put in another little bush
there using the top corner of the two inch brush. Let's put a little
brighter color on the brush and highlight that one a
little so it stands out. See, that's all there is to it. If it doesn't stand out,
change the color a little bit. And then it stands right
out as an individual. Take our liner brush,
a little bit of brown, and here and there and there and here, we can put an indication of
few little sticks and twigs. Wherever you want 'em, see
that's about all we need, just some here and there, not too many. Don't want it to look too busy. Maybe right in here. But that helps create
the illusion of distance because it shows, once again,
more planes in your painting. More areas that it moves back. All right. You ready for your bravery test? It's time. Let's use a little filbert today. Check out your bravery. We'll use that brown
we made from sap green and alizarin crimson. I'll load a lot of paint on the brush, just a lot of paint. Let's go up here. I want a big tree. Maybe a ol' big tree lives (whistles) right there, right there. Let's really make a big tree. Let's give him a lot of arms. I like trees with character. Okay, why not. (laughing) this is our world, we can do anything here that we wanna do. Anything here that we wanna do. My little squirrels need
a place to really play. Shoot, this is just like, this is like going to
the carnival for 'em. They can run up and down this tree, have more fun. All right, maybe wherever. You decide where your
limbs live on this tree. Big ol' tree. Maybe right over in here even, does not matter. Just about any way you can paint
a tree seems like somewhere there's one that looks
just about like that. That's the nice thing
about doing landscapes. If you paint a portrait of somebody and you put the eyes in the wrong place, chances are they're gonna notice. Chances are. But if you paint a tree
wrong, somebody'll come along and say, hey, I know that
tree, he's an old friend, he lives in my front
yard, has for many years. So you can't hardly do him wrong. Take a little white, a little
bit of that same brown, just mix 'em right here on the brush. No big deal, see just sort of mix 'em. Think about where a light's coming from. Maybe, we haven't really
determined this painting, maybe it's coming from the left today. Doesn't matter, it's up to you. So we'll put a little highlight over here on the left side of the tree. Just let the little filbert
brush just bounce along and play so the paint's thick here,
let the highlights pick up the paint, just let the highlights or the high spots, I'm
sorry I said highlights, high spots on the paint pick up the color. Sometime when you get my age the tongue gets over the eye-teeth and
you can see what you're saying. There. All right. Something like that. Okay. But that's a nice little
way of making a tree. And you can really spend
some time and make one that's got a lot of detail in it. And we need to put a
few little arms on him. I'm gonna put some leaves
on him, so it doesn't much, it doesn't much matter. It doesn't much matter. Any area of the tree you don't like, you just put leaves on it. The areas that you do
like, you leave them naked, let the limbs show through. There we go. And each painting will be different. Everybody's painting will be different. That's the beauty of it. There, let's see, wherever. Just want to put a few little indications. Once again, I'm gonna cover
this up with a bunch of leaves so most of this will disappear. But a little bit of
it's gonna show through and people will think
that you worked for weeks trying to put this rascal together. All right. Tell you what, let's use just
a plain ol' one inch brush. I'm gonna take a little
bit of yellow ochre, a little bit of that brown color I made, a little bright red, mix it together. A little more yellow ochre. Yeah, that's nice, just
gonna tape the brush into it. Something like so, I'm
just looking for color that's a little darker
than what I want the high, yeah that's good, that'll work fine. I'm just gonna tap in
some basic little shapes. This is the absolute easiest
way I know of putting a lot of leaves on a tree. Just tape in some basic
shapes, that's all we're doing. Just tap, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. We're gonna come back and highlight it. And put the nice colors
on the outside of it, that's what really makes it sparkle. This is just dark color
so our light'll show up. Because you can't have light in a painting unless you have dark. As I've mentioned before,
it's just like in life, you really can't know
happiness, I don't believe, unless you've known a
little sorrow in your life. Otherwise you wouldn't know
when the happy times come. Now I'm gonna take another,
another one inch brush, I have several, put a little bit of the, a little bit of the liquid white on it. 'Cause you know our golden rule, a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So I'm thinning this just a small amount. And the yellows are a little thinner than the other colors anyway. I want 'em even thinner. A lot of paint, look on
the end, a lot of paint. Let's go up here. Now then, I'm just gonna very carefully pick out the highlights
here by just touching. Just by touching. Once again, this is
absolutely the easiest way I've ever seen of putting a
lot of little leaf indications on a big tree without doing a lot of work. Just reload the brush frequently. There. Just frequently. Put in all your highlights,
wherever you want 'em to live. Wherever you want 'em to live. There, hope you enjoy
all the little critters that we've put on the show. If you've painted with
me, been with me before, you know that they really do
make up a very important part of my life. And I like to share 'em with everyone. 'Cause I think it brings in an awareness. These little critters, we've
gotta take care of 'em. Get on my soapbox here,
but I think we oughtta take care of these little rascals. I'd like for my great, great grandchildren to be able to see animals. And not just in zoos. There. I let my little squirrel,
you probably remember him, Pea Pod the Pocket Squirrel
that was with me for so long. I turned him loose 'cause I
don't keep any of these animals. But he hangs around the
house, he stays there. And everyday when I walk
out, he comes running to me and we just have a good time together. Anyway, let's just take, put something like so. See, we just take our
little brush and tap it in. There. I'm gonna put a little color
in that, but not a great deal. The color that we have on the canvas here will do most of it for us. Just a little indications here and there. Little bit of the bright red. There. Let's take a fan brush, use a little bit of that light brown. Same color we used for
the background of the tree leaves up here. Just gently, gently just
want to put the indication of a little, maybe there's
a little path right here. It looks like a natural place. A little light color, a
little bit of white, not much. Not much, just enough to make
it stand out a little better. There, something about like that. So it gives the indication that maybe, maybe somebody's walked
back here into the woods, had a good time. Let's take a filbert,
put some brown on it, put brown on both sides. And on the one side, just one side only, I'm gonna put light color, see. So it's dark on one
side, light on the dark. Dark, light. Now maybe in our world there lives, this is your bravery test for real. (imitating swooshing) Right about there. Maybe there's an old
fence, what's left of it. Goes right on out. make that one a little darker. Maybe, maybe they had, maybe this old fence had some,
a lot of little arms in it. Maybe they've patched
it up a lot of times. See (imitating swooshing)
comes across like so. This is just a double
loaded filbert brush, very easy to do. In fact maybe, maybe back in here you can see that fence just going way off in the distance somewhere. Just an indication. Comes around the tree, how's that? It's our world, we can do anything. Couple of old boards
that live right there. There we go, out, down. There. But isn't that a neat way
of making an old fence? Works very easily. Take a little bit of the color, just all the colors we've used, put a little indication
around his foots down here of some shadows coming back. Just a few little things,
we don't want a lot. About like that. This is just a very
peaceful little woodsy scene that's easy to do. If we had time it'd be neat
to paint a couple little kids just up walking down here going fishing or maybe back in the woods to play. Let's go back to our little
filbert with some brown in it. Ah, well let's see, not a big tree, just maybe there's an old tree (light growling) lives right there. You thought I was gonna do
a great big tree didn't you? Just a little old tree. Maybe this tree's dead. Got some ol' arms hanging out here though. There, something about like that. Boy it's a pitiful looking old tree. He had a rough life, he's like me. There we are. You know I travel around and
meet a lot of the people who, who watch this show across the country. One of the things they
always are surprised about is that I look taller in real life than I do on TV. If you've seen my son on
here, the one we call shorty, he's nearly six foot six,
and I'm nearly six two. So we're pretty tall rascals. There, put a few little weeds and sticks around some of these things and shoot, we're about to the point have a finished painting. I think we'll take a
little red, sign this one, call it done. I really hope you've enjoyed
this little painting. It's very simple, it's
something you can do, and it'll make you
happy, bring a lot of joy to your painting life. So from all of us here,
we'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless my friend. (light jazz music)
