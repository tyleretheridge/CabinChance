hey welcome back certainly glad you could spend a little time with us today and do a fantastic little painting so I tell you what let's get started haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and they'll come across in the same orders I have them on the palette starting with the white and working around today as you can plainly see I have a black canvas up here and I've just covered this with black gesso allowed it to dry completely and then on top of that I've added a mixture of midnight black and a little bit of Prussian blue not much pression blue just enough to give it a little bluish tint and I thought they would do a little mountain winter scene something let's just do it and see what happens okay start off with the old two-inch brush today go right into a small amount of titanium white as I've mentioned before these black canvases are fantastic if you want to if you want Atma's friends and relatives and etc because they don't see you put the color on top of the black it is transparent and then when you come in here and you add a little bit of white just all kinds of beautiful little things just happen and today I just want to add a very small amount of the titanium white just to get the indication of a little color here and there don't want a lot of color today just a little I will put some clouds I think in here so all I'm looking for is just a little background color this one this is behind the clouds you'll do that first any will come in with drop in a happy little cloud here and there I like these black canvases because a little bit of color shows up so strong and so beautiful it just it sounded real what you can do with them you know I get letters from people every day and they send me photographs of the paintings that they're doing at home and these black canvases maybe some of the favorites and these are from people that a lot of them have never had they've never even suspected they had any art talent they've never had any lessons they just watch the shows picked up ideas got enough confidence grab the old brush and they're doing some beautiful paintings and you can too you really can let's wash the brush shake it up beat the devil out of it all right let's get us a 1 inch brush if we're going to have a happy little cloud we'll just continue to use the titanium white just pull a little color into the bristles now we have to make our first major decision here where does our low clouds live in our world maybe yep you're right there he is I'm just using that top corner of the brush and just making tiny little circles just tiny little circles tiny little circles there you go this is saying along as you as you're doing this think about tiny little circles there you go okay and blend it out look at that let's look how color stands out on this black canvas it's unreal it's unreal maybe there's another little cloud he just floats around right here whatever wherever there we are okay maybe a little more of the color maybe yeah you're right let's have another clad this this will give us a little bit of practice doing some happy little clouds they're a lot of fun a lot of fun and they're very easy to do very easy to do maybe he comes right on we don't know where it goes here a little fluffer there clouds are so free so free they're just one of the freest things in nature maybe it comes out through here there where's the job I want my next life only come back get cloud and just float around have a good time older maintain out take a large brush and I'm very gently just begin beginning to blend the base of this very lightly Jesus blended blended blending once again color shows up so much stronger on the black canvases much stronger than on a white canvas there we go you can blend these till they're dead so don't overdo it just blend just enough to stir them up a little bit mix about their a little bit right in there now I beat the brush just to remove excess paint off of it so I don't have to clean it again then I'm going to fluff them let them tease of pull them this is not not a very firm pressure on applying that just gentle just gentle just enough to grab it move it a little bit and very lightly very lightly look at that look at that I had some fantastic little cloud look there they stand out once again so strong from these black canvases this black gesso is one of the most fantastic things years ago I used to just use black house paint listen I've had some letters and people they wrote and told me that didn't do too well so the black gesso is designed specifically for this hmm okay let's build us a mountain let's build us a mountain today I'm going to use just black and vendek very own little Prussian blue we'll throw some alizarin crimson in there too what the heck looking for a color that looks very dark looks black okay cut off a little roll of paint have it right on the edge of the knife and then you have to make a major decision where did your mountain live in your world I think he's going to live over here so let's go right up in here and let's just drop us in a nice big mountain nice big nut I like I like to do mountains because it gives you gives you a lot of experience with a knife once you learn how to do mountains with this knife oh it's your friend you can do anything maybe this comes over here and there's another peak lives right there wherever you want there if you can do mountains with this knife you can do off just do rocks stones and roads and buildings and some of the past series we've done entire paintings using nothing but the knife absolutely nothing but tonight we'll have to do some more of those type shows it's interesting to see why can be done just using a knife it's a little difficult because of the time restraints there we go now I'm just using a two inch brush I just want to pull this down this is an excellent way of laying out highlights and shadows you can see those brushstrokes in there every stroke you make it stands out I hope you can see those on you on your TV set but you can lay out entire mountains just just using the brush strokes and you're not committed you can change it free feeted lee literally hundreds of times but it teaches you how to how to make your mountain look the way you want it to look there so we just can carry away make all kinds of beautiful effects okay let's put some snow on that mountain for that I'm going to use titanium white and put a little bit of black with it just to dull it down just a dollar so it's not pure white pull the paint out firmly just really get in there and raise the devil with it and then cut us off a little roll of pain again you want that to be right on the edge of the knife okay now that no pressure just let it touch the canvas and Gray's all this touching is that roller paint it just grazes the canvas graze it and caress it there make good friends with it look at that that the paint break and work for you we have a very firm paint and it's designed specifically for this technique and it works so well but you need a very firm dry paint most most important now you have to make some big decisions where does these Peaks live are they in the background in the foreground we'll put this one in the foreground like so here we are just let them go or everyone think about where the light would strike Keawe takes a light use some pression blue Prussian blue some black looking for a gray blue color sort of a grayish blue that's not bad something like so once again our little roll of paint now we can come back in here and we can begin playing in all cancelin shadows just follow the lay of the mountain here say here comes one to me looks like there's a valley right in there so just pull it create that illusion the illusion there now they don't see that peak right there I want to push it back watch here right here you might have seen me do this before but it's always fun just come directly distinctly through that and it pushes that son-of-a-gun right on the back and here I'm going to leave that dark so it looks like our nice recessed area leave some dark in there times there we go here's a nice one and here and there there's one you can put the indication of shadows and it causes like little ridges and all kinds of beautiful little effects very simply there we go change that let that go where we want to but practice these mountains it will open whole new worlds for you once you learn to to make friends with this knife get a little more of the titanium white with a touch of black in it so without flat once again our little rule of paint I want to put a few highlights over here on this little mountain this reminds me of my home in Alaska where God was having a good day when he made Alaska so beautiful if you've never been there your your to go see it while it's still wild you can see more creatures there in one day so beautiful my favorite uncle sent me there Uncle Sam you know he he asked me if I'd like to go up there for a while and if you don't go you're going to jail you know how I'll say I'm ask you to go but I went up there and I fell in love with a crazy place it is so spectacular I was born and raised in Florida I didn't know that things like that even existed I've never dreamed of there no pressure want that paint to break creats all of those beautiful little effects just sort of bring that together right in there like like a little valley lives now little mountain goat has to have a place to go hide now then we'll take we'll take two-inch brush and very lightly will begin tapping always following the angles in the mountain now I'm going to have snow down here so it doesn't matter if we get a little paint down here we're going to cover it all up so don't be worried about it don't be worried about over here we want to follow these angles look at the angles in your mountain and follow them want to create that illusion of mist beat the brush to remove excess paint now maybe right in here sometimes you can very gently just blend things together here see just blend them together it'll make it look like it's a little misty or you're laying right between those there bring it right on down now very lightly two hairs and some air grab that and lift upward gently lift upward upward upward there over here follow these ankles lift it upward now you're just lifting right in here you don't want to lift and destroy all these just diffuse the bottom of the mountain so it looks like it's sitting right there right in mist okay we wash your sole brush give him a good scrub shake him up cover cup of cameraman and wearing business business all right let's use the same old dark color here we had some black some Prussian blue some Van Dyck Brown Blizzard crimson doesn't matter there's some dark sienna we can throw that in there whatever you have well there when we clean the knife let's grab us a fan brush here there and I'm going to load it full of this dark color that we just made full of color a lot of paint and back in here back in here we're going to have some little evergreen trees that are far away now they'll stand out against that lighter mountain color maybe they come down there we go and what this just to be straight so I'm gonna have it go uphill here a little bit so we have some we have some variation in our in our land make him look a little more a little more interesting if it goes every which way there maybe comes right I don't up here I don't know wherever you want it wherever you want I help push all those mountains back but you need that little misty area in between a little mystery is your separator it keeps it keeps the mountains and the trees apart I'm gonna put a little bit of that shadow color head left here and just lift up worthy to create the the illusion a little distant tree trunks I want this very subdued very quiet see just shows up good that's all now if you get one that's too bright you don't like it all you have to do is continue to rub it and it'll go away it'll go away now maybe back here true let's have some fun a lot of paint a lot of paint what a messy brush I got there look at that son of again I got paint all the way up to the furrow that's okay maybe back in here there lives a few trees are closer to us and they're big and they're strong there they are see now if you have problems making your paint stick over this mountain because it's there's a lot of paint back here add some paint thinner to your dark I'm doing all right right here today but sometimes you have a little problem if that occurs just add a little thinner because a thin paint will stick on top of a thicker paint there and I do realize that happens sometime people write and tell me that they're having some problems usually if you just add a little paint thinner that'll cure there you don't mention before we travel all over the country we give painting demonstrations and work with PBS stations and other charity groups around the country to help we'll make a happy buck or two and if we get to your area come see us shoot I'd love to have the opportunity to meet you and talk with you I've met with literally thousands of people it's it's fantastic they bring photographs of their paintings in sound real what people are doing and if you'd like to know what I'm going to be in your area drop me a line just put your name and address on my card and send it to the address at the end of the station they'll send it to me we maintain a little mailing list amell I'll try to drop your card and let you know who we're going to be in your area well we got a whole mess of trees going there and then it's going to take a knife just hearing here I know those are hard to see but there's little lines in there we need to brighten this picture up I'll put some snow in it that'll that'll zing it you find a big brush okay let's get serious we write into titanium white now we have color on the canvas already we have a blue and black mixture so hungry when we put color on get a little less shadow color too and we put color on there it's going to get a little darker than what we have on the brush and we're depending on that okay got to make a big decision towards you snow live let's say soon goes right let's go uphill down likes dancing or I know you saying Bobby made a mess this time you may be right too I've certainly been known to do this there we go but we don't we don't make mistakes you don't we have happy accidents very soon very soon if you start painting in this method you'll learn that there's nothing that goes wrong and correct anything it happens one of the things when I was teaching classes continually that's so good and if you were teaching this will help you with students is if you sure that they're there are no mistakes you can fix everything it happens and that really helps get you over some of that fear well we have a lot of fear we first touch a big old blank canvas once you once you get over that that's when you're really really beginning experience enjoy a pain there see there that's quickly well we get a whole snow bank in there just like so okay weirdin brush go there it is let's have an evergreen on the other side same old color same ol color I'm really loading that brush full of color a lot of paint both sides alright maybe it is a tree that lives in our world yep right there all right there here he comes there kind of just work back and forth making the bristles Bend downward as you work down a tree get stronger and stronger and more and more pressure I commend more it makes those little things that hang under the limbs little I call them hang you downs for lack of a better word but they're always an evergreen trees those little hanging down thanks there see how this one's closer to us and by putting trees in different places that once again helps create that illusion of distance though having a little friend right there okay now that we can reach up under here grab some of that dark and pull it down that creates our shadow under our tree fixes the bottom of the tree calls one stroke and then I'm going to take some white and a little bit of phthalo blue I like a phthalo blue it's a brighter blue nice bright blue okay maybe there's a happy little a little path need a little more blue doesn't show up enough you see it well there see just a little path and lives right in there there yes that blue makes it cold but table blue so quite warm it's a nice blue and here and there you can bring some little things down the fan brush you can really get in there and smooth things out put little individual things and blend them just make all kinds of happy little things going on I'll tell you what this is a nice place for a little building let's have maybe right back here against these trees come right up here so we can I'm gonna scrape out a basic shape just take the knife scrape out a basic idea of what it is that you want here just scrape it out there we go see still not committed at that point are you doing just scrape it out okay take some white let's put a roof on there need a roof now here's a little trick so you can come down that edge get all your lines nice and straight and when you pull this down then you'll have a beautiful straight edge sneaky huh there we go now we need a little bit of snow on the other side of the roof over here just like it get into some Van Dyke Brown there we are see there we putting in all we're doing is blocking in some color they're just blocking it in now we'll take some dark sienna that's some white very gently very gently just pull straight down make us a nice boards there add a little Van Dyke Brown to that darken it down a little more there yeah we can just whack off the bottom get it the way we want it you know what time maybe I'll tell you what let's go right up in here excuse Marvin just a second you can see that I will put some little things like it then we go right up here on the top a little little bit of winning maybe we'll just take and turn this into a little Church this lives out here but a little steeple right up there just all covered with snow boy it's really cold out here there the snow laying all up around there yeah maybe tell you what let's do this maybe getting ready for a service they've turned they turned lights on here they've got the lights burning in the windows so let's just creep out the indication of some happy little windows won't take a little bit of CAD yellow just put in in the case of a little light coming through those windows there people gonna be arriving pretty soon cold a cold day okay back to my fan brush here that in this put some snow right up around the foot here I can't okay maybe tell you what maybe right here in the foreground let's just put a little treat and is right there hair is give him a little friend or two just want to put a little something here it'll push everything back and that helps create that illusion of distance in your painting a little bit up a little bit of shadow underneath should I think with that have a a finished painting hope this gives you some ideas shows you what can be done black canvas hope you enjoy our little Church in the in the snow from all of us here happy painting and God bless you Oh you
