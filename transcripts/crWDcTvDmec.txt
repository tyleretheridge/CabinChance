- Hi, certainly glad
you could join us today. i thought today we'd just do a little winter scene, just very simple. It'll make you feel good. Lets start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. They'll come across right about there. While they're doing that, come on up here, let me show you what I've got done. Today I have my standard
old pre-stretched, double primed canvas. Say that with a mouthful of rocks. And I've just covered the entire canvas with a very, very thin
coat of liquid white. So the canvas is wet and it's slick and it's ready to go, so as I say let's just have some fun today. Let's do a winter scene that's
got a little color in it. Sometimes winter scenes
can become too cold. So I'm going to take a little bit of the cadmium yellow, a very, very small amount. I just want a little tiny
bit of color in this. Let's go up here. Now, up in here, let's
just start, and this probably won't even show now. It will as we progress in the
painting I believe though. A little bit of yellow,
right along in there. Just making little X's,
or criss-cross strokes. Whatever you want to call them. A little bit more of that, I like that. There, I just want a little glow in the sky so it's not, it's not a totally dead winter scene. Alright, that's really
enough, and as I say it probably doesn't show up much yet. It will, it will. I'm going to take some white, and some midnight black. I'm going to make a gray color. There, dark gray. Okay, let me wipe the old knife off here. We just wipe the knife on a paper towel. I'll just use that same
old brush, that's fine. Go into a little bit of that color, just tap a little color into the bristles. All right, let go right up in here. Then we can just begin. Winter has a lot of gray skies, so that's what I want to make today. Just making little X's,
little criss-cross strokes. Like so. Just put in a little bit of color. There, see that's all there is to it. Start at the top, and work downward. That way your paint is continually mixing with the liquid white
that's on the canvas and automatically, automatically your sky will get lighter, and lighter
toward the horizon. And in a landscape, that's exactly what you're looking for. All right, something about like so. I don't want to lose all my little yellowish color there. I won't have a glow in my sky, and I want a glow there. All right, let me grab another brush, I have several of them going here. Make sure it's dry, and then
I'm going to blend this. Start in the light area and blend toward the dark area. Now when you're at home you can take your time and really,
really blend this out, so it's just as smooth as silk. There, alright. And then we'll just go across the entire canvas to remove the brush strokes. Okay, I'm going back to my brush that had all that nice, gray color on it. And let's take, and once again, all I'm doing is just tapping the bristles right into a little bit of color. Just tap, see you can see one corner is hitting, but the back
is really not hitting,. It's just the front corner I'm using. Let's go up in here. And maybe in our world there lives, does now, does now, that easy. Just a happy little cloud that floats around the sky here all day. And I'm just using that corner that you watched us load, just using that corner and doing tiny
little circles with it. The back of the brush is
not touching the canvas. It's just that corner. Something about like so. Like that, just making little circles. Okay, going back to my
brush that's sort of clean, and then very gently, very gently I'm going to blend the base of that out, so it just disappears, just dissolves right into that sky. There we go. Once again because the liquid white is on there, this works very simply. I'm going to lift it, fluff it. You could use you're little blender brush to do that if you wanted to. There, something about like that. Speaking of the little blender brush, you can take it, I'm going to tap the corner of it, same way
as we did the other, into a small amount of titanium white. Just a little. And this brush is so soft, you can go right back over, and
maybe there's a little light that zings right through there. Just blend it right in. Right in, have a little
light spot up in there. There, we can reinforce
our cloud a little, and we're in business, that easy. That easy. I love to paint skies,
they're a lot of fun. Lot of fun. Okay, same old brush. It has the gray color on it. I'm going to take it now and go into some titanium white, I want to lighten the color. And pull the brush, wiggle it. Wiggle it as you pull it, that pulls the paint towards
the end of the bristles. It make the brush very sharp. See there? Good. Now with that, let's go up in here and lets make the indication of some little distant trees. They live far back in the distance. we're just using the side of the brush, and bending it sidewards. This is a super way of making little trees that are far away, far away. I don't want a lot of detail in these. As trees get closer to us, then we'll put more detail in. right now, we're just looking for indications of little trees. There, isn't that an easy,
easy way of making them? You can do this, you can do this. Give them a little friend right there. Something about like that. we just put a few little doers in there. And we'll come back, we'll come back and blend them out some. Okay? Watch. Clean dry brush. And get mean with it here. This is where you get tough and take out all of your frustrations and hostilities, just get in there and really tap it. Just tap it. We want to create the illusion of mist down at the base of these, Lift upward, it takes out
all of the little tap marks. Shoot, we got it, that easy. I'm going back to that brush. Now I'm going into that
same color, it's just grey. And we'll put the least little touch of Prussian blue into it. Least little touch, least little touch. Not much, I want it to be gray. Just want to change the
flavor a little bit. Now then, maybe we're getting into some trees that are closest to us. So we touch, and this time I'm going to give it a little upward push, so it looks like the bristles on the tree. I mean the limbs on the tree. The bristles are on the brush. Looks like the limbs on the tree are sort of going upward. Look at that, isn't that the easiest way to make a tree you've ever seen? Shoot, trees aren't difficult. There, just put them in. Decide where they live in your world and drop them in. Now we have two trees. This is mostly black, a touch of prussian blue, a little white, but mostly, mostly black and white. Once again, I'm pushing sort of upward. I want these limbs to sort of go upward on the tree. And you decide, in your
world, how many there are. You decide. There see, here comes another one. Now sometimes, sometimes you get a little crazy. Of course if you're an
artist, that's expected. You can even, you can
take the big brush here. Look there, there's a tree, maybe he got a little more sunlight,
he's a little stronger. Got a little more detail to him. About like that. And we'll go back. I'm just getting a clean, two inch brush, and all I'm, when I beat
it on easel like that, the only thing I'm doing is removing any excess paint that
's accumulated on it. And now I'm, once again,
beating it very hard. Really getting in there and tapping it. There. Now these, these planes create the illusion of depth and
distance in your painting, They're very valuable. They're your best friend. Take care of them, take care of them. Now I'm going a bit into
the black some more, I'm just, same color I'm
just making it darker. I might even put a little
Van Dyke Brown in there too. I want it to get much darker now. Alright, let's have one more row of trees that covers up this side, and it starts right in there. See bust sort of pushing upward at the same time going
sidewards and upwards at the same time. There. And you put as many as you want. Once again, you create your own world here, any way that you want it. You do it. I tell you what, get
brave, here's a big one. Push, I'm really pushing
hard toward the bottom. As you run our of paint
you push harder and harder. Get it all out. That's the beauty of
using these big brushes. There we go. There and just a few more
little things here and there. Wherever you want them. There. Okay, there's one. Something about like that. Alright. You have to decide where theses go. Sometimes when you have this much power, you have to make these big decisions. That's the price you pay for power, you have to make decisions. And that's what we're doing right here. We're making decisions where our world is. And where it goes. There. Alright. But the nice thing about it here is you can change your decisions. You can change them at anytime. It doesn't matter. You could also put these in, these basic shaped in with a fan brush, if you so desired. it works too. Sometimes I do them with a fan brush, sometimes a two inch brush, just whatever. Find what works for you and do it, use it. Use it. The biggest thing here is that each layer becomes a little darker. And that way it creates that illusion of depth, and distance. Yeah, there. Boy we have a whole forest here. I didn't know we were going to paint a forest, but that's okay. It gives you a lot of practice. You learn by repetition. Doing it over and over and over. In some circles they call that practice. And if there's any secret to this technique or any technique it's practice. That's all, just practice. It's like tying your shoe when you first started it was quite difficult. You had to look, and take your time and really work at it, and now you probably do it without even looking. I told that to a lady one time and she looked down and she said "Why are you wearing loafers then?". So anyway. Some of us learn better than others. Now I want to tap the base here. Tap it firmly. Firmly, I want to create a lot of mist. A lot of mist. Really get in here and take out all of your frustrations and hostilities. There, this is better than arguing with your spouse or picking on the dog or whatever. There we go. Something like that. Then lift upward gently, gently. After we do all that hard tapping, now you got to lift up gently. But that will make mist
that looks like it's so soft and everything is just floating in there. Time to wash your brush. I really just wanted to get even with the camera people,
they've been hassling me. Now then. In this painting, let's have some snow. There's many ways to make snow. The easiest way is just to load the brush and pull it. But sometimes you want to make snow that looks like powder. I think we did that in another
painting in this series. We'll do it one more time. Just tap. Then we'll go up here and just like we're putting grass in a summer
scene, just tap in. Just tap it. Just pretend your making a little hill of grass back here, only it's not green, it's white. Because green snow is bad, it really bothers people when they look at your painting. There, okay. now, let's take our little blender, that's just as tender as it can be, and very gently, very gently, just go over that, and it makes it look like snow that's just powdery. I hope that's a word. Now then, I tell you what, I'm going to take the
least little touch of the blue there, on the blender and add a little bit of
blue, right down in here. A little Prussian blue. A little Prussian blue. That will be our shadows in
snow that's closer to us. Just blue. There, something like that. Wherever you want it. Alright, now that we
have a shadow in there, maybe there's another
little layer of snow. This is what creates the lay
of the land in your painting, Let it go right down
into that nice shadow. Tell you what, maybe
it comes, i don't know, make a decision here, maybe it comes around like that. It would be very simple to turn this into water, if you wanted a little
pond in your painting. Be very simple. All you'd need to do is put a little reflection under it and pull it down. But I don't think we'll do that today. See now you have all
these different layers. I tell you what, let's do, yep, right here, right there, that's a good spot. Lets put us in, lets put
a little house in here. Wouldn't this be a gorgeous place to have a little house? There, come right on out here. All I'm doing is scraping out a very basic little design. Just so I have an idea, Let's go into the Van Dyke Brown, dark Sienna mixed together. Put a little crimson in there too. Now then, the side. There he is, see? I'm putting the dark in first because I'm going to have snow on his roof. So just decide basically
where the roof line is. This is both browns with
a little crimson in it. Not much, just a little crimson. Just want to warm the brown up even more. There, I don't want this
painting to be too cold. You have to put your
coat on to look at it. Something like that. All we're looking for is
a very basic little shape. Alright. i tell you what, let's get crazy. Let's make, let's turn our little house into a log cabin. You want to do that? Okay, we'll put some little doers across this way for the top. There, I lived in Alaska for a long time and there's some of the most gorgeous log cabins I've ever seen in my life. You wouldn't think they were log cabins, they look like castles made out of logs. Whew, beautiful. In Anchorage there's a couple that you have to see to believe. Now here, we're going to have
logs going the other way. And all we'll do is first
put in a little light area. Don't worry about it. There, see? Pay attention to the angle, that's probably the most important thing. because we're looking at whats called a three-quarter view of the cabin. We see both the front, and the side. So you have to play with angles, they're important here. There. Now on the other side, maybe theres not as much light, so
I'll add some brown to it, and we'll put the indication of a few little things over here too. There, something about like that. That's all we need. That will give us what we're looking for. Maybe, I tell you what, let's get crazy. Let me get the small
knife, that ones too big. Maybe, we'll have a window. I always do cabins, nearly in my paintings where there's nobody home. So let's put the indication maybe somebody's home. Take a little of that yellow, Cad yellow, a little white, and we'll just put some
light in the window here. Of course, maybe the lights are on, and nobody's home. There. I've been accused of having that disease myself. But that's okay. Artists are expected to
be a little bit different. And I take full advantage of it. There. Alright, we'll just put some little window panes in there. That easy, that easy. We need a roof, because right now, right now, this little fellows probably getting cold. Now, one of the easiest ways here is to sort of outline it, see? And then you come down, just come right on down. Once again though, angles
are very important. Very important. There. Alright. Alright, I think we're in business there. now we need a little snow on the other side to show that it's deep. It's very deep. Now you can make it very smooth, I like to leave it rough sometimes, because snow begins to decay on you. There, I tell you what,
you want to get crazy? Let's do it. Maybe, maybe this little carpenter that built this was industrious and
maybe he put a porch on it. So we pull out a little of that color just to get rid of that brown. Then we'll come back in here, a little white, got to put a little snow out here on the porch too. If it's snowing on the roof, it's snowing on the porch. Something like that. Here, let me just wipe the knife off. Take a little brown, and put about the same, basic thing out here. We need a little place
to set the rocking chair. Alright, lets put, Just a few little posts
to hold the roof up. Something like that. Take a little color, and just come along the edge here and just sort of clean the edge up. Bring it all together. Shoot, we do a cabin-ectomy here to get all of our angles right, and we're coming along pretty good. Let's go back to our snow brush. Put a little snow that
lives right in here. Right along in here. Maybe it comes right on out, I don't know. Wherever you want it. Then back to our little blender brush, and very lightly, barely, barely touching. Something about like that. Shoot, that's almost too
good, I have to do it. I have to do it. This is just the perfect place to have a little path. Take a little white,
let is just wander back, a little road maybe goes
right on back up in here. Something about like that. It just meanders up the way there, as they say. There. A little darker color in
here where the ruts are. Shoot, maybe this comes all
the way up, I don't know. Then take a little more white and make that snow bank a little
more distinct right there. So now we have just a little indication of a little road that goes up in there. Our little blender brush,
bring it all together. Alright, now then. Let me find the old knife. One more thing I'll put in here. Take a little bit of brown. Maybe in our world there lives, maybe there's what remains
of an old fence right here, Something about like that. And we need a rail that
goes across the old fence. And here comes another one. About like that, and we can take a, let me wipe the knife, we can take a little bit of white, and
just go right above it so it looks like there's some snow laying on the fence too. There, see there? There it is, there it is. You can do that. Maybe a little snow on
top of that post too. Alright. Let me get a little liner brush. There, usually at the
bottom of a fence post, there's little weeds, and sticks and stuff that grow in here. Because you can't cut
too close to the fence. So you get these little things, maybe there's all kinds
of little doers here. Alright. You know me, I like, I like trees. Take that same color. There, if you have trouble making it come off of your brush, all you need to do is add just a little
bit more paint thinner. Because a thin paint will slide right over the top of a thick paint. It's that easy. There, something about like that. Just decide where they live, drop them in. In your world you can put them anywhere that you want them. It's totally, and completely up to you. And you can add all
kinds of little branches, or maybe that old tree is dead and there's not many left on it. But you've got to have a few things here for the little birds to sit on. In the winter time, they
need a place to sit. Of course they do in the summer time too, but here they can sit
and watch you here, and wait for you to bring
them out some bird seed or something to eat. I raise a lot of little birds every year and turn them loose, and so I have a special place in my
heart for little birds. There. Sometimes you can take a little of the liquid white if you want to make it look like icicles hanging off
and just pull a little, just here and there. A few little icicles. You can even highlight one side of these posts so they
show up a little better. There. Okay. When you do yours you take your time and you fix all these little details. There. Alright. And wherever you want to have some little indications that little
things are still growing, just drop them in. There's some up here too. I'll put a couple up in here. There, wherever. Wherever. if you want to make the
road look a little deeper, take a little bit of
that, I mean the bank here on the road look a little deeper, take a little of that gray color, and just sort of outline it a little, and then blend it right in. There, see? And it gives depth to
that side of the road. There, like that. And shoot, with that we're about to the point where we have a finished painting. Let that come right on up. I'm going to take a little bit of red, and sign this one. I think we're going to call it done. I hope you've enjoyed
this little winter scene. It's very simple. You'll have a lot of fun doing it, and if you have time, after you do it, take a picture of it and send to us. We'd love to see it here. Sometimes, when time permits, we show them on the air, what people just like yourself have done. Until then from all of us here, I'd like to Wish you Happy Painting and God bless my friend. ♫
