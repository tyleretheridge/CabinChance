hello welcome back I'm certainly glad to see you today let's do a little painting today that I think you're really liking and let me tell you what I've already get done up here I've got a black canvas as you can plainly see but the thing that you might not be able to see on your screen at home is there's a an oval cut out and put on here this oval is just contact paper and I've stuck it on then I've painted this black with black gesso allow that to dry and then I've covered the entire thing with a mixture of alizarin crimson and phthalo blue and in the center here there's a little more crimson and there is out here I've let it get progressively darker toward the side so it's brighter in the middle it is out here so tell you what let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this fantastic little painting and we'll go on up here and get started I'm going to start today with the old 2 inch brush go into a small amount of the liquid white I'm going to go right up in here you have to make a decision right off in this painting where as or is your light area going to be I think it'll be right there I just take the liquid white and begin blending outward making little crisscross strokes but always blending outward once you start we want to keep this area in here the brightest but look how that shines son of a gun well you put that liquid light on top of that transparent color it just comes alive there now we can do this as many times as we want to achieve a desired lightness okay but the only big secret be sure you wash your brush between each application shake down that's really the fun part of this back to the brightest area little touch to the liquid white and off we go there it had fantastic that you could make us guide is that pretty that easy now very lightly you can just sort of blend across and take the brushstrokes out and have a look-see at what you have and if it's not what you want this is the time to change it don't wait to your paintings halfway through and then go back and and say hey I want to change the sky this is the time to play with it tell you what let's go into some lizard crimson little lizard crimson little phthalo blue same colors I'm just going to just going to tap some into the large brush here there we go just tap load a little color I'm going to use just the corner of this brush and let's go up in here and maybe in our world maybe there's some little bushes and trees that live in here there they're just some little indications that hang out over here there it's a very soft little painting we're going to do today misty and quiet pretty little rascal okay maybe over here wherever you want to just just put in all kind of little things you have to make decisions where they live I want to say that bright area and that's slightly off-center so it's not it's not right in the center slightly off-center there's just another one see just drop them in wherever you think they should live now I'm going to add a little bit more blue so it gets a little bit darker as it gets away from this white area see little darker hope you can see that it's all kind of little things happening there looks like a little tree branches hanging everywhere a little bit more to the bluish tone too there okay we have a dark color in the brush let's go with the other side here I put a few little things in there these are just little background trees and bushes there where they have them tell you what we're going to put the indication here and there some little tree trunks and some stems and twigs so I'm going to take I'm going to take a little paint thinner on my liner brush and go right into that same exact color I want this color to be very thin water consistency just it'll flow can you turn that brush and bring it to a nice sharp points yes sharp it is so script liner brush here has very long hair on it too so it'll hold a lot of paint now that I want to just here and there here and there put the indication of some little twigs and stills and all kind of things happening let's go right in here see you I just sort of let your imagination be a guide here just drop them in wherever you want to maybe there's one there he comes but these little details here really make your painting stand out if you're in a group selling paintings and you have all these little details guess whose paintings are going to sell and this painting is so simple this is one of the easiest paintings in this entire series even if you've never painted before this is one that you'll have good results the first time you tried it's very very easy and it's fun and maybe the most important thing it's a striking painting it's really an effective little son of a gun I like this one there maybe over here there's a stick and a twig wherever you just would have to make some decisions where you think they live and put them in look at that but look at that light glow in there or you can just see that the light just it's just filtering through there yeah I've painted so many paintings and I still get excited when I see this work guess that's the kid in me it never gets old as one thing is so fantastic about painting if you paint a million paintings in your life you're never going to be satisfied and the next one's going to be your masterpiece and there's always something to learn every time you paint a picture you learn something that will help you when you do your next to them King scoop the other side of this put a few into this side don't want him left out there they go strong in there by making these on the side bigger stronger it gives the illusion that this is farther away than here and it sort of wraps the painting around and it's very pleasant to the eye there we go now they cleaned off my little brush and I just wash it in some paint thinner you wipe it on a paper towel I want to put the least little indication of a tiny little bit of foliage but not much not much be right back grab a blue tiny little bit of blue and a little bit of titanium white this is they look blue lizard crimson and the least little touch least a little touch of titanium white okay now then here him there I just want to put the indication just burly so it just barely shows I don't want it I don't want it to be too bright because this is too far away and I want to retain that misty of parrots 9 your painting if you want it brighter just add a little bit more white and it'll really stand out it's very individual however you want yours to be that's exactly the way it ought to be king maybe yep right there we can see just a little indication of some nice little things that are happening back here on this tree but not much we don't want much okay let's go to the other side now and here a few little things there's a few these are so subdued I hope they show up on your set there we go maybe yeah there's one just sort of pick them out all you do it is just sort of looking around deciding where they live drop it a few little things in just one there's another little one maybe down here just a few happy little things growing around the bottom should we get it and that's really all there is to it okay let's have some fun here let me get there we go get no two inch brush here that's not dirty we'll put some of that same lavender color into the bristles just tap a little bit in okay now I'm going to come right down here and go right into the CAD yellow little touch of yellow ocher just sort of mix them together on the brush little endian yellow hearing they're the least little touch of a bright red and by mixing color on the brush you end up with a multitude of colors happening on the brush you don't have just one flat oded color it's all kinds of effects going on saying it tap give it a little push that loads the end of the bristles now then maybe in here there's some soft grassy areas all you have to do is just begin touching just touch tap see there like I don't go very gentle you can make this look absolutely like velvet they're darker and darker darker back in here because it's going back into the to the shadow areas oh okay right on down here and you just sort of work in layers completing the most distant layer first and coming forward forward forward always working forward there if you want to brighten an area maybe you want a light coming right through here and right in here I went into a small amount of just straight titanium white I say and all you have to do is just barely touch and that will highlight right right by that light areas but don't overdo if you overdo it'll kill the effectiveness of it see that gives impression if there's a light shining through there but if you do too much it's just going to look too bright there tell you what let's do maybe there's some rocks and stones live out here take some Van Dyke Brown pull it out very flat plans you can get it go straight down with a knife cut a cross and get our little roll of paint there it is okay let's go pare that maybe maybe right in here somewhere look at there just touch give it a little side words pull we're just going to put the indication just a few little rocks and stones and some dirt going here and there there we go wherever you want them now then then titanium white little dark Sienna mix them together so they're marbled t know if that's a correct word or not but you know how to mean it's not over mixed there's all kind of streaks going through it because those streaks are still on the knife see okay now then you can take that and just let it sort of bounce along barely touching graze it caress it there softly very softly see but it it's just like when you put snow on the mountain you need it to break and it leaves some holes and stuff in there so the dark shows through it looks like dirt from the rocks and stones and shoot you can even put a big stone right there where you on you let some dark underneath them standing right up there I know that's hard to see when we get the little grassy areas around though then it'll stand out and it'll stand out a little more of the color on my two-inch brush okay let's go back up here yeah come right down in front of it and that'll push that dirt right down into the painting there we go that easy I like little paintings I guess now this one as I mentioned earlier has an oval on it if you want to do this painting without the oval all you do is leave it off paint the whole canvas with black gesso and take off this makes a beautiful full-sized painting just because I have the Oval on here certainly doesn't mean that you have to there we go sand you're just working down down down and layers always in layers have it let's have some fun we find a fan brush here maybe there's some trees that live in there let's go right into midnight black load a lot of paint on the brush a lot of paint a lot of paint both sides for see their kids go up here maybe their lives in our world right here a nice tree this comes down to about like that okay like him just a little thicker we make him a little stronger a little bigger now he has a friend there's right there that trees name is Bill see if I used to give them names there make friends with them what the heck maybe maybe maybe there we are there is one right there see we just let them grow out off the same spot yeah then take my liner brush paint thinner on it once again we want this paint to be very thin very thin so it'll flow let's go right up here and it let's decide where some limbs live on this tree maybe there's one right out through there see but the paint should be so thin that it just flows right off your brush maybe yeah there's one up here there we go thank you just how limbs would grow on this old tree this is your tree so you decide wherever you want to however you want them that's the right way there maybe this one comes right on back across we don't know Liam's cook all kinds of ways there one up in there okay one over here I recently was doing a show for one of the PBS stations and we did a painting like this only big great people and then we auctioned it off for the PBS station make a happy buck people really like this one when they could see it up close it's a beautiful beautiful painting and we travel all over the country doing shows for PBS stations and and charity groups so if we get to your we get to your town that you're left to have the opportunity to meet you and talk with you so come by and see us and if you want to know when we're going to be in your area just drop me a card when you name an address on it and I'll put it with our mailing list and when we get to your area I'll let you know we'll drop your little card there and you can just send it to the addresses on the end of the show they send everything to me here I'm just adding some more little grassy areas here there we go I just layer after layer after layer say maybe you want to strengthen this a little bit I want to make that a little more distinct right in there go back it's a dark color mm-hmm dark color makes that light just jump right out at you okay little bit of grass right in here should we can just bring this right on down didn't that fantastic and as I say if you've never never painted with me before this is an excellent painting for your first project it's so nice and it works well it works so well there now the more you tap on this little grassy area here the softer it will become it will absolutely get to where it looks just like velvet that's very nice okay let me find a one-inch brush here we'll just use the same old one we were using go right in to some blue some blue and some alizarin crimson it would just mix these on the brush okay I want some very dark colors here this should look black should look black I'll be right back I want to get a least little touch of paint thinner I want to thin it just a tiny bit because I'm going to apply this over color that's already on the canvas so one of our golden rules is a thin paint will stick to a thick paint so if you start with a very thick base color then you can put lighter colors over the top of it thinner colors now I want to put the indication of some silhouetted leaves in here so all we're going to do just use the corner of the brush I'm killing all my beautiful little tree limbs but that's alright we know that they are sometimes that helps give you an idea of where to put these if you have alleles on your trees there maybe that comes right up into here we don't know wherever you want these are just little loose leaves they just sort of play around all day and have fun there we go good and dark now I'll have that color maybe there's some bushes as live right here we'll just push in a little bit of color we need that darks or a light I'll show we'll have a little bush or to the lives there there he is okay I'll grab another brush and I'm going to dip this into a least little touch of liquid white and then go back into my yellows grab some SAP green load the brush full of color full of color pull the brush in one direction one direction so it loads a lot of paint right on the end of the bristles one direction though okay now if you have a lot of paint loaded into this brush it takes very little pressure on you touch up here if you don't have enough paint you have to hit hard and it sorta smush is you know it gets all it'll get all muddy on you but with a lot of paint all you have to do is use a very gentle touch just give it a little push just enough to barely barely bend the bristles on okay reload the brush but another little bush you look at there and put in little layers leaving some dark areas in between it's most important that you leave those little dark areas maybe back in here it is a happy little blue sure to not like so well like so just wherever you are we can have some of these just come right down from there foots there now with a clean knife we can scrape through and allow some of that black to show through it looks like little sticks and twigs hope you can see those they are here if you can't see them they're here it looks like all kind of little sticks that are holding off your bushes and see just wherever put one right over there you can see it over the top of that light color really add some detail to your painting okay tell you what on this particular I want to bring show you how to bring this tree forward watch here all you got to do let's take a little color like so and you can pull that rascal right on up into the foreground that easy and once again that helps create the illusion of depth you can see grass between this tree and this tree and now there's distance between them just one of those little things that will make your painting look a little special little dam right there yeah then it won't take this is some dark sienna white get the leastly touch a bright red least little touch pull it out very flat get us a very small roll of paint on the knife tiny little roll now if our lights coming from there maybe there's a little light that just bounces right through here we'll put some on and I'll show you how to mute it calm it down a little light hitting right on those tree trunks now we'll clean the knife and just begin touching tapping this is just a clean knife so the color mixes together and that will subdue it down make it quieter but it'll still leave a little sparkle out here added on the edge of these trees where maybe a little lights just shat it through okay let's do this one there see that tree a little bit right here wherever you think light would hit okay shoot speaking of trees let's have some fine that's Assam fine I'll just use little big knife big man for small knife pullout Van Dyck Brown get a roll of paint and maybe there's a big tree lives right over in here I like these old big trees in my painting but if you don't want it in yours leave it off watch here though watch here watch you excuse my arm for just a second maybe this loam comes down there he comes this is your bravery test this is your bravery test okay maybe yep you're right it's another big limb right there there's a lot of paint here a lot of painting when this one dries it'll feel like real bark maybe there's another limb comes off in this direction they're jingling a pickle people root holds up this monster tree other one in there and in it tell you what we had this color it was oh wait but a little dark sienna a little bright red probably not very flat get our role of paint pull it out roll up ain't that easy came out of it very gently very gently just let this touch graze and just slide right down the tree you just barely barely touching no pressure just like putting snow in the mountain all day on a tree same low pressure over here a little bit right there where the lights coming through there on the other side we'll take a little blue a little blue little white let's just put the indication here of a little reflected light here and there there just sparkles it up gives her a cool color a bit longer Brown you can lay that in here and sort of bring all that together just let it work right around like so and you could take a little brown on the liner brush and put the indication here and there of a few limbs in my world I think this whole trees it's dead but there's still a limb here and they're hanging not many okay tell you what let's do that's how the camera come right up here and I'm going to take the contact paper off and let's take a look isn't that fantastic to me these are some of the most beautiful little paintings and I think with that I'll sign this one take a little bit of bright red go right up here certainly hope you've enjoyed it as I mentioned several times this is a very nice painting if this is your first attempt so give it a try and from all of us here happy painting and God bless you Oh Oh you you
