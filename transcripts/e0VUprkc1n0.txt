hey I'm glad to see you today you really do another fantastic oil painting with me let's go get started here tell you what let's have them graphically put all the colors on the screen that you need to paint along with me and they'll come across in the same order as I have them on the palette while they're doing that let's go on up here now I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white it's wet and slick and it's all ready to go so let's get started now today we do a let's do just a happy little painting it has a big mountain in it and shoot maybe a little water and all those beautiful things let's do it I want to take off day with a 2 inch brush go into a small amount of the yellow ochre just a little bit tap it into the bristles let's go right up here now then maybe right in here using the little crisscross strokes we're laying a small amount of the yellow ochre a very very small amount don't don't get carried away with it just a little bit k-kevin without cleaning the brush I won't touch the least little amount of alizarin crimson just just a very small amount came back up here and here and there but you just want to blend down a little touch of that just to give it a a little bit of warmth nice and warm I'm very soft there we go okay I don't want to set this guy on fire all we want to do is put put the least little bit of warm color into it and we will throw a little bit of that color right down this area we know that's going to be water so we can just go ahead and throw it in okay let me clean the old brush scrub it off shake off the excess then just beat the devil out of that is really fun you like it you like it let's start same ol brush and we'll go right into the midnight black load some color onto the brush all right let's go right back up in here we'll just take a little that black color and I'll just sort of still use a little crisscross strokes just begin making some happy little things in the sky here there we go you just make all kinds of little patterns and shapes and just throw them in throw them in just let your imagination take you wherever you want to go this piece of canvas is your world so you can do anything that you want here anything there we go hmm while we got that going I'm gonna take a little bit more of the black and put the least little touch of phthalo blue into it so we have black and blue black and blue that's why I look after arguing with my wife there okay we have the bristles all loaded up we're ready to go yeah pull from the outside in and put a little bit of water in there I don't want to cover up all that nice light area in the center we want to add a little light shining right through this area when we're finished so don't cover all that up pull it from the outside in there okay then let's wash the brush got that really beat off there now they're back into this light area and let's just blend this guy out let all these little colors just just blend together so you can't tell where one stops and the next one starts there we go you know one of the questions that I get asked quite frequently is what kind of canvas do I use I'd recommend you have a canvas that's double Prime two coats of primer on it that way your liquid white will stay wet for an extended period of time we very rarely ever use the canvas boards because they are absorbing liquid white and pretty soon you're working on a dry surface and the other thing is I use a canvas that has a gray primer on it that way you can tell exactly where your liquid white is and you don't have to you don't have to wonder if an area is covered or not okay let's build us a happy little mountain in here I'm going to use the midnight black and a phthalo blue black and blue pull it out very flat cut across get a little roll of paint okay let's go up here now you have to make a big decision where did you where does your Big Mountain live maybe right in here where you just just drop it milk and make all kinds of little little things the only thing you're worried about is this nice outside edge you could cure less what's happening inside just that nice outside edge all right and sort of look around if there's mountains in in in your area and you that's the kind of shapes that you're probably most familiar with and you were to put in your painting if there's no mountains in in your area you can leave the mountains out of these paintings it's no problem we just want to show you how to do it what you do is up to you because when you paint as you know we're very rapidly how to paint how the paint becomes easy that's the easiest part of it what to paint that's what's hard and we get a lot of questions about where do you get all the ideas for your paintings believe it or not a large percentage of the ideas we get are from photographs that people send us or your ideas so if you have if you have something you'd like to see painting on one of the shows drop me a line you may see it right here I'm taking a little bit of a midnight black titanium white making a gray color cut off a little roll of paint now then that gray color let's just put some happy little highlights on here just grab it no pressure no pressure just sort of let it bounce and play and have fun let the paint break but no pressure most gentle touch imaginable so you sort of float across there no pressure it off there we go tell you what let's have some fun in this old Mountain take some play little blue and alizarin crimson a little bit of titanium white so we have blue crimson little white and sort of make a little lavender color there we go don't over mix it leave it all marble II like it James take a small edge knife and cut off a little roll of paint okay let's go peer maybe over in here we're just going to begin touching and pulling down this will be the shadow side let these little colors just happen there look at all the little things that's what makes it pretty and you know on this piece of canvas you can have any color combination that you want any colors this is your world and you can make it any way you want it painting to me represents freedom I can create the kind of world that I want to see what I want to be part of and you can too now then I want to play some more here I'm gonna go right into the dark sienna but a little tiny bit of white with some cut off that little roll of paint again just tiny little bit on the smaller edge of the knife and then right back up in here and just barely touch just graze it here and there this is a time you could use a small knife it would work very good for this hair just wherever wherever where you think a little bit of but a color should show and you can make it a little brighter in places take some of the mountain color let me go back and you can drop in some dark shadow areas see how you can play with that mountain just miss some of these colors to sort of just work back and forth and then bring them all together a lot of fun and back to our highlight color let it sort of overlap here in there I'm Kate now with a clean dry two inch brush I want to begin misting this just tap it follow the angles in your mountain and you're just barely tapping over here follow these angles I want to create the illusion of mist at the base of these now lift upward very softly very softly barely barely caressing the canvas there we go see just barely touching it but you can soften bring all that together this looks like sort of a reminds me of a mountain maybe in in Arizona New Mexico somewhere like it beautiful scenery there and we have so many fantastic friends in that area adding you can begin creating all different planes in your mountain just all kinds of beautiful little things may be a little dark right there you just play some of these colors right through there hmm it's fun to do all these little things make you happy your friends will never believe that you did that you'll never believe what you could do do you get an earn triumph one of the earlier shows we showed you some of the paintings that people are doing all over the country it's almost unbelievable the success that people are enjoying we now have oh gosh we have now nearly 120 shows so out of 120 you can certainly find one that that paints an area you're where you live there look at that yeah then I'm just going to tap right into a little bit of my lavender color the black little brown disorder I'm just mixing up all the Mountain colors on the brush do it on the brush now then let's go right up in here and maybe there's some happy little things that just come right down this mountain follow the angles in the mountain oh that's very important very important there we go there they come and come right down this side there just have some little things in there and that helps create the illusion of distance and depth in your painting now very lightly short tiny little strokes lift up reading tiniest tiniest little strokes quarter of an inch tight teeny tiny little strokes there okay now then with a clean brush I want to create the illusion of more mist to here so take a clean brush and again just tapping it that way it'll mix with a liquid white and you'll get softer and softer mister you missed here that easy okay hmm see how quiet far back that looks gives you a strong oh mighty Mountain hmm okay I think we got it nice little little Mountain back here I'm going back to my old dirty brush here we're going to some brown and we'll pick up some SAP green a little bit of that mountain color just all the dark colors huh with some SAP green added same old mountain colors the black and browns okay let's go right in here and maybe maybe we'll have a happy little foothill yep lives right there see just take the corner to brush and pull straight down straight down just sort of just tap it pull downward all you're worried about this nice top edge there okay now we know this is gonna be water so underneath here I'm going to put what will end up being reflections just drop them in forever nice traditional painter these reflections were a little son of a guy's used to drive me crazy but on a wet canvas reflection or one of the easiest most fun things that you can do now with a clean brush grab it pull straight down it's important that this comes straight down straight down and very lightly go across you don't want to destroy all these little lines in here all you want to do is just move them a little bit so it looks like water happy little water things happening all back in there okay now then take a one-inch brush go into some black some SAP green there we go just pull it in one direction through there load a lot of paint into the bristles can't go back up here maybe there's all kind of little bushes to live there add along the edge of the water here just drop in some basic little shapes to help give the illusion of distance let them get smaller as they go back over this way that will help make it look like they go further and farther away and if you happen to hit in the wrong place maybe down here for example all you do is take your brush pull it down see there and that easy you can create a reflection you have to remember we don't make mistakes we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents okay and we'll go into some yellow with the one-inch brush and some SAP green yellow and SAP green also try making greens out of the midnight black and yellow beautiful color one direction load a lot of paint just go back up here now then I want to come right in here see here and just begin putting some little bushes and little trees that are we back in here all kinds of happy little things there is one that's a little more green in it you can turn the brush over and reflect a little bit that right into the water look at there that easy can add some yellow ochre Indian yellow all these little things they're saying turn it over tap a little bit right into there that easy that easy grab it pull down straight down it's most important this comes straight down now this is two hairs and some air and then go across see instant reflections there we go okay take the knife put a little bit of liquid white right out here cut across it like at go right up in here and we'll just literally cut in some nice water lines right through there there we go keep those lines basically straighten basic history and you put as many little ripples on your water as you want sewed up to you okay now then I'd like to have some big old strong evergreens in here I like evergreen trees they're a lot of fun to paint so it takes some black some black SAP green throw in some blue looking for a color that looks black and blue might as well mix up a pretty good amount here throw in two Browns whatever you have laying around okay let me clean the knife off maybe today tell you what let's do let's use let's use an old two inch brush and load it full of paint you need enough pain in the bristles so the bristles stick together wiggle the brush wiggle it and in sharpen it so it becomes very sharp see there look how sharp it is that's a chisel edge that's what we're looking for pull it get it very sharp maybe there is what there is now there is a happy little evergreen and he lives right there don't be afraid of this brush because it looks big it'll do unbelievable things for you make it your friend your brushes need to be your friend learn what they will do devote some time to practicing if there's a secret to this or any style of painting withered or there'd be portraits or florals Lenzi it makes no difference if there's a secret it's practice it's practice I always like the story about the the great violin player and he played a concert and afterwards a lady came up to him and she says oh my gosh she says you're so fantastic she says I would I would give half my life to be able to play like you do and he looked at her and he said I did so that's all it's just practice you can be the best all you have to do is practice devote some time to it well I get to talk in here and trees just appear everywhere if I talk to her a couple more minutes we'd have whole canvas full of trees tell you what let's put let's put an almighty tree right there big strong son of a gun he got a lot of sunlight there we go yes drop him in it not a super way to make some fantastic little evergreens or big evergreens in this case and come right on down right on down there here we go see in another one there when you're creating your own world you have to make big decisions but lives in your world let's have some happy little bushes here I'll go back on this side we'll just push him oh there he is there yes just two little bush there we go all right you see all of this as you probably know already he's gonna end up paying reflections that easy let's go back to the other side no I'm just getting crazy here maybe there's a happy little tree in he lives right here and let's just bring this for I don't know there like that that's good that's good there and this you really you really push it in there try not to let the brush slide like that see difference practice bending the brush just bend it there your bushes will be much happier and if your bushes are happy you'll be happy and I sincerely want you to be happy with what you're doing cause that's when it becomes fun that's what makes it fun take a little the dark Sienna a little white get us a little roll of paint okay and we'll put some trunks in these little happy trees back here just some indications you're not gonna see the entire trunk so don't worry about it scratch it a few things see there well you just put all kinds of little doers in there there we go scratch outside trunk ideas and sanda down in here we can do the same thing on the other side there we go just some little indications same thing now these things must ever be covered up but someone will show through and people think you spent a week with your little one haired brush in there don't tell them any different don't tell them any different just enjoy okay now then I'll go to the one-inch brush you set green and a little bit of CAD yellow pull that brush to a nice sharp chisel edge very sharp okay let's go back up here now then let's put some nice highlights on some of these trees don't overdo don't overdo it's real easy to kill all the dark it starts working and you get carried away and next thing you know you covered up the whole tree don't kill it all see they're just sort of work it back and forth where you think light would strike Kenna scored on the other side over here and put some highlights on these old big trees let a little Sun play through there and sparkle those films you can do it okay this comes right on down we don't know wherever you want to go a little bit on this like so now then I want to take some more of my yellows and I'm using three different yellows here Indian yellow yellow ochre and a little CAD yellow pull it brush in one direction get it full of paint come right up here look at there there it is let that just shine out there there like all these little things tell you what I'm gonna do we know this is gonna be reflection so let's pull that down pull it straight down and then we can turn right around and reflect some of this into the water right into the water you can just put all these happy little things here and do layers layer after layer after layer and also layer it right into their reflections then let's see if you have a delicate touch barely touch down and across okay then we'll go into some Van Dyck Brown and we're just touching here and we'll put in some last little land areas little rocks and stones we can take some that gray color we used on the mountains and just barely touch that it sort of bounced just let it bounce along there create the illusion of some highlights and tap in a few little things just to break up that straight edge little liquid white cuts it a little water line right here said cleans if the bottom brings it all together scratch it a few more little sticks and twigs and we got it that easy maybe over here there's a weed said there was a nice tree it lives here there it is just like so and you pick up a touch of the bright red let's let's put something there that oh there's a nice little orange rascal see if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little bit of paint thinner a little bit of the liquid white there we go and work in layers I know you get tired of hearing me say that but it's important if you don't work in layers it's gonna look flat I'll tell you tell you what I want to do here will have a happy little path so who this take Van Dyck Brown look at that look at that just Van Dyck Brown a little bit of dark CNN it won't hurt sort of nice pull it across and we can take some Brown and some white and go back and just barely touch it's just like making snow break on the mountain see there and that easy we have a happy little path drop in all these little things around his foots but there we go and we'll push that path right back and look at there now you don't know where the path goes and that's super he just sort of disappears back here you'd wander around blow up his path to catch a big old fish it lives in there just like that okay I know scratch it a few more sticks and twigs wherever you think they are to live and I think we'll sign this one and call it finished I'm dipping my brush right into a little bit of the liquid clear go through some bright red and let's sign it right here the old clock on the wall is telling me it's time to leave you for this week so I certainly hope you've enjoyed this painting until next time from all of us here happy painting god bless I
