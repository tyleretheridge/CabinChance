- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us
today. And as you can see, today I have one of my
little friends here with me. This is a little nighthawk that
I brought in for you to see. I'n't he the most
gorgeous little character? He is somethin' else. I love these little animals so
much, every so often I just like
to share one with you. So I say this is a nighthawk, and he flies around at night
and eats insects by the ton. Just flies around with his mouth
open. This one's been injured,
he only has one wing. But he's doin' very, very well. Anyway, this is a painting show, so I think we should paint. Let's start out today and have
them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along
with us. While they're doin' that, I'm gonna set this little fella
down. So if you'll come right up here, I'll show you what I've got done
already. 'Kay, set him right over there. Today I have my standard
ol' 18 by 24 inch canvas, but you could use whatever
size is convenient. And I've just covered it with a
very thin, even coat of liquid white. So it's all ready to go. And I thought maybe today, we'd just do a painting
that's a lot of fun, I'll think you'll enjoy it. Let's start out with a small
amount, oh, we'll use a little phthalo
blue. Take the two inch brush, just tap a little into the
bristles. Somethin' like so. Let's go right up in here. And we'll make a happy
little sky in this painting. Just by making little x's,
little criss-cross strokes. We start at the top, and
begin working downward. And that way, the color, the
phthalo blue, will mix with the liquid white
that's already on the canvas. And automatically,
automatically, your sky will get lighter and
lighter as you work down toward the
horizon. And in a landscape, that's
exactly what we're looking for. So it works without you
even worryin' about it. There. I'm a very lazy person, so I
look for easy ways to paint. And this is one of the easiest, most effective ways I've ever
seen. All right. Somethin' about like that. Now I wanna make the
corners a little darker, so it'll bring your eye into
the center of the painting. For that, I use a little
Prussian blue, 'cause it's much, much stronger,
whew. Much stronger. So just up here in the corners, and I'll let it blend downward, we'll add a little Prussian
blue. Little bit over on the other
side, too. Right over here. All right. And when this is done, that really will help bring
the eye into the painting. There we go. Now I thought maybe today we'd
paint a happy, little cloud. I like little clouds,
so, we'll just do that. I'm just wiping some of that
blue down on the bottom, get it off
the brush. And we'll just use it
for background material. No use wasting that good paint. Yeah, then let's wash the ol'
brush, that's a fun part of this. We wash our brushes with
odorless paint thinner, since this is oil paint. There we are. Shake off excess. (thwacking) (chuckles) And just beat
the devil out of it. That really is a fun part. Now, I'm gonna take titanium
white, just plain ol' titanium white, and tap the brush into it. Just tap it, like so. One corner, basically. Let's go up in here. Now maybe, see I left a little
area sort of open there, because I want a little
cloud to live right in there. I'm just sort of gonna tap it
in, and let it wander right off the
canvas. Little more of the white. We just sort of let it wander
around. Clouds are one of the
freest things in nature. They just sort of float around, have a good time all day. There, something about like
that. Wherever you want 'em, that's exactly where they
should live in your world. Exactly where they should live. Maybe, yeah, why not, we'll
have one up here, too. Just drop 'em in. Mm-kay, we'll grab a little
blender brush. With a blender brush here, we can very gently just blend
this. The blender brush is so soft, that you can go right over the
paint, without causing any major
disasters. There we are, fluff it up a
little bit. I'n't that one of the easiest,
nicest ways you've ever seen of making a fluffy, little
cloud that lives in your world? There, you can do it. There we are. All right. Shoot, we'll just keep using that same brush we were
tappin' the clouds in with. I wanna touch a little
bit of phthalo blue. Little white, little
phthalo blue mixed together. I want a light blue color. And let's go up in here and
maybe, hm, maybe, yeah, I like that. See it's just a little
darker than the sky is. Just a little bit. Just enough so it stands out. Maybe in our world back here there's a little footy hill
that lives right there. Wherever you want it, you
decide. Just tap in a basic little
shape. Somethin' like so. Give it a little upward lift. Look like little trees, far, far
away. Far away. I'm gonna put a big tree over
there, so I'm not worried about it. You know me, I like big trees, so I'm gonna have one there. Now then, we'll put another
layer. Same color, only we'll make
it just a small amount darker. Just a little darker. But it's the same color. And, right there. As things get closer to ya in a
landscape, they should get darker
and darker in value. See there, that easy. Already it looks like it's
closer to you than the first one we did. Sneaky, huh? But that's one of the little
things that'll make your landscape absolutely special when you do
it. There we are. Somethin' about like that. Now, once again, I'm
gonna just lift upward. It'll pick up some of those little pieces of paint we laid
on there. Make it look like little trees,
far away. Far, far away. Now you can spend all day with
your little, tiny ten brush and paint each one of those in,
individually. But shoot, why? I think this looks just as good. And you can do it very quickly. Ol' two inch brush'll do
wonderful things for ya, if you just give it a chance. Let's take some Prussian
blue and some black. Let's get crazy here. Prussian blue, black, I'll be
right back, get a little sap green, some
crimson. And I'm just brush mixin' these, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, we're just
looking for a good, dark color here. We're moving into the foreground
more. Big decision time,
maybe, yeah, right there. This dark we're applying only so we can put some light on top
of it. You need dark in order to show
light, so that's all this is, right
here. Just tapping in the dark. (grunts) But think about the lay of the
land. Begin thinking how you
want the land to flow. Like that. I like these little distant
foothills. Aren't those gorgeous? Some of the beautiful states, you know, like the Carolina's,
and etc., Missouri, you have all these
little rolling foothills. Gorgeous. I love 'em. And you can make layer
after layer after layer. Shoot, we do a lot of traveling and when we go through there we always got our camera out, 'cause it's so pretty. Mm.There. And we'll pull straight down, I want a little pond there I
think. And in our world, if we want
a little pond, it's that easy. All you gotta do is pull
downward. Straight down though. Decide where it lives and drop
it in. There we go. It's most important these
lines come straight down. Otherwise, it'll look
like your water is tilted. And still water is always flat. It's lazy, like me. Now then. Shoot, I'm just gonna
use that same ol' brush, it seems to be working pretty
good. I'll go right into some of the
yellow. So I'm gonna use all the
yellows. Every once in awhile I want
a little touch of bright red. But I want to tap that to
get a little bit of paint. See that little roll right along
there? There's one just like it on the
brush. And with that, then we'll
come back on this dark, and we'll begin putting in
some little grassy areas, that live way back in the
distance there. There they come. Just load a little more
color on the brush. You decide where they live. You can put 'em wherever
you want in your world. Wherever. That's what I like about
painting. It gives you freedom. You can, you can create
any illusion that you want. Any illusion that you want. At least in this piece of
canvas. About like that. There. I've got several brushes goin'
here. Let me grab another one. I think way back in the
background we're to have a tree. Grab the knife here. Let's mix up. We'll just use a bit of
everything. I'm gonna put some phthalo green
in there, Prussian blue, black, crimson. We just throw it all in there. Maybe even a little Van Dyke
brown. As long as it's good and dark. I like that phthalo
green in there, though, it'll give it a beautiful,
beautiful color. I wipe the ol' knife. Now, same thing. I'm just going to use a two inch
brush, load a little color on it. And let's go up in here. Time to make some major
decisions in our world. Maybe there's a happy little
tree, lives right there. Somethin' like that. Once again, all we're doin' now, is putting in some dark color, so that we can come back and
highlight it. Maybe that tree lives there. I don't know, you decide. In your world, you have
to make these decisions. Where these trees live, rivers
flow. All right. Shoot, that's pretty good. Maybe we'll do another one. 'Bout like that. Basic shapes, that's all we're
looking for at this time. That's all we're looking
for, don't worry about it. Let's go on the other side. I want a tree to be over there,
too. Yeah, why not, right there. You know, when you paint, you just sort of look at things that are happening in your
painting, and make decisions. Learn how to compose what you're
painting. All you need to do is start out with the time of day and
time of year in your mind. And sort of let it go. You need to know the time of
day, so you know where your
light's coming from. Need to know the time of year so you know if there's snow on
the ground or it's bright green. But other than that, just have a basic idea
of where you want to go. And let your imagination carry
you anywhere that you want to be. To me that's really the
excitement in painting. There. Now this is quite dark, so, I want the reflection in the
water to be much darker here. That easy. We got it. See? That's all there is to it. Take a little script liner
brush. Take a little bit of white. I'm gonna get a little dark
sienna. We'll just mix 'em on
the script liner brush. And with that, we'll put the
indication here and there of a few little tree trunks. We don't have to worry
about 'em being too great, 'cause we're gonna cover most of
'em up. Few little things in here. Then let's go on the other side, and put a couple over there. And those little trees,
don't want them left out. You could actually just take the
knife and scrape through the paint. And it would give the indication of some tree trunks, and you wouldn't even have to do
anything. There. Now then. We'll just keep using
this ol' two inch brush. Seems to be workin' okay. And with that, we'll tap
in a little bit of color. And let's begin putting some
highlights on these little trees. Now you could use a one inch
brush. And I get letters from fantastic people all over the
country. And sometimes they'll say, "I'm more comfortable
with a one inch brush." It will do exactly the same
thing, maybe not quite as fast. But if you don't have
a mean, ol' director, then you have unlimited time. You can just paint it any way
you want it. So at home if you want to use a one inch brush to do this, try
it. Try both. See which one works the nicest
for you. The only thing we want to
do here is give you ideas. Show you how to make effects and turn you loose on the world. Let's go over to the other side. This little tree. Don't wanna be left out. Let's start with this one down
here. There, see? Now he's a happy, little tree. He was sad 'til we put some
leaves on him. But in our world, everything's
happy. There. I spent half my life in the
military playin' soldier. And now I just make happy little
things. All right. There's no military
allowed in my paintings. There. No bad guys, no good guys, just people who enjoy
life, like God's creations. That's all we have here. And you can create any world
that you want on canvas. Now if you have trouble makin'
that paint stick at all, add the least, little touch of
paint thinner to your brush, and then go through the paint. It'll thin the paint and it'll stick right
on there, no problem. Add a little sap green to my
color. There. Maybe, yeah, there. Now see how you can just make all these little bushes and
stuff? That easy. That easy. It's not difficult at all. You decided where they
live, and drop 'em in . Very quickly, if you paint, you'll learn to see and you'll
learn, you'll learn what imagination
is. Shoot. Oh, I gotta have a little house
here. This is just perfect place for a
house. Let's right here, right here. I see him. I would like to live right here under this group of trees. So we'll just scrape out a basic
shape. Somethin' about like so. I scrape it out to do two
things. To lay out the basic idea of the
house, and to remove excess paint. We'll start with Van Dyke brown, dark sienna, just mixed together
loosely. Loosely, so you have both
colors. Leave it marbled. Both of 'em in there. We're just gonna block
it in using these browns. Then we can decide what
we wanna do with it. There, see? Maybe, yeah. There's a side right there. Let's get crazy. Shoot, maybe, maybe there's a
little shed that sticks right out on the
front here. There. Now then, we can take
a little bit of white, little brown and I'm gonna put some yellow ochre in it, too. White, brown, little yellow
ochre. And let's come right along in
here. Doop, doop, doop, doop. Put some boards in this old
place. Just a few little duders. Wherever. There we go. See 'em? Somethin' about like that. I wanna take some bright red, little bit of dark sienna mixed
with it. Little touch of white. End of that. I like red roofs, so I'm
gonna put a red roof. But now, when you do your
painting, maybe where you live, there's
a different color roof. That's okay. It's okay. All I wanna do is show you how
to make these little rascals. You design 'em any way you want
'em. Maybe where you're at
they're any color roof, I don't know. As I travel around I see just
about anything that you can imagine. Somewhere. Let's take, just wanna firm
that edge up a little bit. Not much color over here. It's away from the light. Not gonna see much over here. Let's see, we're gonna have a
little little attachment onto the
house. Little shed, maybe. So that easy. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do. That easy. See? We got him. There, that's all there is to
it. So it's quite a nice little
house. He's okay. Maybe it's a, looks more like a little farmer's place out
here. Maybe this was a farm a long
time ago. Maybe it sort of grew up around
here, like at my house. All right. Now, we take the liner brush, little paint thinner, little bit
of brown. Maybe, yeah, if this was a farm, maybe we can still see
a little bit of fence, that goes up, goes over
the hill back here. We don't know where it goes. You decide. But just to give the indication. All right. Time to have fun. You know me. I want a big tree. And the big ol' tree is gonna
live right up here in the sky. Here he comes. Big ol' tree. There. See? Be brave, throw him in. Don't worry about him. Don't worry about him. On this piece of canvas, anything that happens,
you can take care of. Don't worry. When you first start painting, the thought of hitting this
big ol' piece of blank canvas, sort of scary, I know. But once you jump in there and
do it, it just works great. I wanna take a little dark
sienna, little white, mix 'em together. I wanna put a little bit of
indication of some land right out through
here. Just a little bit. Don't want too much. Somethin' about like that. There, comes right on around. There we are. Take a little touch of the
liquid white, pull it out as flat as I can get
it. We'll put a little waterline
back here. Just a little light area to
sort of separate the two darks. There. And little bit right in here. All right. We're gettin' crazier now. Just put all these good
dark colors in here. Yeah, let's do this. We'll just close this
little pond right in. You can just do anything
that you want here. Just fill this up. All kinds of little duders. Just think about the lay of the
land here. You can really put this
in with a paint roller. But it's an excellent way, well, maybe not a paint roller, but you'd put it in just
any ol' way you want. It's an excellent way, though, to practice with a brush. Make friends with it. I would suggest you practice the
stroke that you're gonna use
next time right here. Don't ever waste an
opportunity to practice. All right. Little sap green, little yellow. And we can come right in here and we can make a little grassy
area out of that, that easy. That easy. Maybe on, oh yeah, I like that
better. Little bit brighter right there. There. Somethin' about like that. Now then, maybe up here in our
tree. So, a minute ago I mentioned you can just take a
knife, and you can scrape, and you can make the indication of tree trunks just like that. It's up to you. Whatever way is easiest for you
. Sometimes you wanna take
your time and paint 'em in. Sometimes you just wanna scratch
'em in keep right on goin'. It's really up to you. Put a few little leaves and
things up here on this tree. See? Don't want him left out. But i'n't it fantastic, that with a big o'l two inch
brush, you can do things that look so
detailed. And with practice, mm, you will
be amazed. I have people write me everyday, and they say, "You know, I did
some paintings the other day, and I took 'em to show 'em to my
friends, and they actually started
looking for numbers on 'em. 'Cause they didn't
believe I could do that." I hear that every day. Every day. And nothin's greater than
hearing about people's successes
when they do this. That really makes it all
worthwhile. So thank you very much
for sharing that with us. There. Another little tree lives right
here. Little bush. Happy little bush, huh? There. Wherever. You decide. You decide. See I'll show you another way. I'm gonna show you another way. You can make grassy areas, maybe these are closer to us, and they're a little bigger. I'm gonna use a fan brush. Just number six fan brush. You can use any size you want. I like a number six. Same colors though. Same colors. But there's a multitude of
colors happening on that brush. 'Kay, let's go up in here. Now, you can just take
and just give upward push. Now sort of adjust the
brush back and forth. 'Cause if you go straight,
well, let's do it. See, you get this big smiley
face. So adjust the brush, until
it's going fairly straight. And you can just give it a
little push, and all those little
grassy things will happen. That easy. That easy. And it makes grass that
looks like it's closer to us. There. I'll tell you what. Now let's take a little
bit of our brown colors. Maybe we can see a little soil, little dirt through there. If you want it in your
world, just drop it in. We take a little brown, little
white, mix it together. And very gently. (scrapes) That easy. That easy, just run right over
it. Now we can come back with
our little fan brush, and just pop in some little
grassy areas around it, to make it look like it's
part of the painting. That easy. See it? There. But i'n't that a fantastic way
of makin' little grassy, little grassy
areas that are little closer to ya. All right. And a little practice with this, and you'll be amazed at
what you can accomplish. Absolutely amazed. I know I am, every day. Every day is like a gift. Somethin' new happens on the
canvas. Study it when it happens. Even, sometimes, even a mistake, or what you think is a mistake, turns out to be a learning
experience, that maybe is better than what you were trying to do. Evaluate it. We don't make mistakes, you
know. We have happy accidents. (chuckles) I'm wanna take
a number three fan brush. Doesn't matter what size you
use, I just happen to pick it up. Maybe, in our world, there's a, maybe an ol' tree was cut down, or fell down right here and there's part of the stump, still lingerin' around. We'll just put it in like that. And we can take the knife with a little brown and white on
it. And we just sort of highlight
him. There we are. Poor ol' tree. Him fall down. Probably hurt. But he's okay now. And then we just sort of fill
that up with some little grassy areas. And he lives right in there now. Take our knife, and just
scrape here and there. And put in all kind a
little sticks and twigs and happy little things that
live all out here in the, this beautiful, little scene. Now I think, I think, let's
take our ol' liner brush. Little bit of the bright red. Paint thinner. Think I'm gonna sign this one, call it finished. Hope you've enjoyed this little
painting. It's very simple. And it will teach you how to use all the equipment. And it's a lot of fun. And with the ol' signature on
here, think we're gonna call that one
finished. From all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy
painting, and God bless, my friend. (smooth jazz music)
