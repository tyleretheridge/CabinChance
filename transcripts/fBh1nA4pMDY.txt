- Hi, welcome back. I'm certainly glad you
could join us today. I thought today we'd just do
a painting that's a lotta fun, so let's start out and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that, let me show you what
I've got done up here. Today, I have my standard old canvas, and I've taken a little
black gesso on a paper towel, and I've just sorta gobbed it all over, except right in here and there, I've just sort of pulled it. I want to have a big waterfall
today, so just a basic idea. We let the black gesso dry completely. Then we go back, and I've
covered the entire canvas with a very, very thin
coat of Liquid Clear, and over the Clear, I've taken a little Thalo
Blue and Thalo Green mixed together, and painted up to here. Then here, I've just used a
little Thalo Blue and black, and very little paint on
top of the Liquid Clear. I just want enough so it sorta
stains the canvas a little. That's really all we're looking for. So, we have the black gesso, the Clear, and then a little bit of color on top. Let's go and just have some fun. I'll show you how fantastic this can be. Let's start with our old
two-inch brush today, and a small amount of the Titanium White. Right up here above the waterfall, I wanna have a nice little
soft, light area coming out, so we take the white and
we go right up in here. We just begin making little Xs, little criss-cross strokes
right above the waterfall, something about like so. Just let it blend back
into what's going to end up being big trees and stuff back in here, like that. See all the little black gesso
things still show through, and it looks like you've
worked yourself to death, and you've done very, very little. That's the beauty of this black gesso. It may be one of the neatest things that we've ever come up with. There, and you can make that
as bright as you want it. Maybe you want it a little
brighter right in there. You can take and several times. It's up to you. You can add just a little
more of the Titanium White and work it out, something like so, to whatever degree that you want. There, now then, tell you what. The fun part of this painting
is the old waterfall, so why don't we jump right in and do that? Let's do that right off. Let me wash the old brush. That's the fun part of this. It also keeps our crew on its toes. Shake it off. (laughter) On one of the earlier shows, I showed you the cameraman over here, that he wears a raincoat
behind the camera. That way, we're sure
not to get him too wet. Okay now, let's do the waterall. For that today, I'm gonna
just use the old fan brush. I'm gonna dip the fan brush into a little bit of the Liquid Clear. I don't need a great deal. Then, with the Clear on the brush, go right into a little Titanium White. Don't go away, I'll be right back. I'm gonna get the least
little touch of Thalo Blue and put in there, just
to flavor it a little. So, we have a little Liquid Clear, white, and the least little touch of Thalo Blue. Let's go up here. Now, I wanna make a stroke that comes across and then down. It'll give the impression that
the water's sort of flowing, and then somebody pulled the stopper out, and (swoop) down it went. So, we go over and we go (shoom). Try to do it fast. If you do it slow, your
hand's gonna wiggle and you get a waterfall that, do it fast. It really works better if you do it fast. You decide how big you
want that waterfall to be, maybe like that. Now, we have this nice waterfall. Now, we're gonna push it way
back into the background. Also, let's do it with a two-inch brush. Take the two-inch brush and pull upward, and blend it in. It'll soften and bring all that together. See, you can look right
through that waterfall and see stones and rocks
that are behind it. There, that's sorta sneaky, isn't it? All right, let's mix up,
let's mix up some black, a little bit of the Prussian
Blue, a little Van Dyke Brown, Alizarin Crimson, maybe
a little Sap Green, too. What the heck, whatever good dark color
you can come up with. Okay, let me wipe off the old knife. Now, we'll just continue to
use the old two-inch brush. I'm gonna load a little bit of this color into the two-inch brush by just pushing. See how that brush is sort of sliding? See, there's a little ridge of paint. There's one just like it on the brush, and that's what we paint with. Now then, maybe in our world,
there's some big trees. Here they come. There they come. Just use the corner of the brush, and begin forming some basic
shapes for some nice big trees. They just sorta hang out here, just sorta hang out here, like that. There, all right, and right along in here. I don't know. Maybe on this side over here, here comes some big old doers hanging out. All I'm looking for right
now is some basic shapes to give me some ideas
of where all these trees will end up being. We're not committed yet. All we're looking for
are just basic shapes, just little basic shapes, so don't be too concerned. You can even take the black gesso and mix it with white gesso and make all kinds of gorgeous effects before you ever paint the first stroke. There. And people, they'll go
crazy trying to figure out how you made some of these effects. Shh, that's our secret. Now then, we need something
to contain our waterfall. We've got an idea where
the trees are gonna be, so we'll use a little Van Dyke Brown, a little Dark Sienna mixed together. Pull that flat, cut across, and we get our little row of paint that lives right on the edge of the knife. Now, I'm gonna put a big old
rock that lives right there. That gives us some
boundaries on that waterfall so it doesn't just hang there. There we go, and this rock is in front of that rock, because I want that
rock there to be behind, back behind the waterfall. There, something like that. There we are, all right. All right, now we'll take
a little touch of white, a little bit of Dark Sienna,
Van Dyke Brown into it, maybe the least little
touch of Yellow Ocher. Oh, maybe a little more, I like that, just enough to flavor it a little. Cut across, our little row of paint. Then, we'll come right up here, on the top of this big stone, rock, cliff, whatever you wanna call it, and just barely touch him. We wanna make this look flat on top because this is where
maybe there's a little fox that lives out here in these woods. He sits right here, and
he watches everything, so he needs a little flat spot. It doesn't hurt to make up
little stories like that, to give a reason for things
being the way they are. There, now, no paint, just grab the edges and pull down. I want this to remain quite dark, maybe the least little, there we go, the least little touch of
paint, almost no paint. I'm gonna put a lot of
grassy things in here that's gonna cover that and push it back, so don't worry about it at this point. Don't even worry about it. Maybe a little will show
through here and there, so we'll just put some
spots here and there that, maybe, some of the little
grassy areas will show through. All right, see there. It looks like little stones
showing through already. As I say, this black
gesso is just so neat, and it makes your painting
life so much easier. Now then, let's go back
to our old two-inch brush. Maybe over here, let's decide
where these big branches hang. Maybe they hang right over
in front of the waterfall. That's scary, isn't it, after
you do such a waterfall? It's so nice, then, you start dragging
all these big tree limbs right over the front of it. But, that's all right,
you know it's back there, and if you learn, your time is not wasted. It also helps create that
illusion of distance, because it looks like
the waterfall is way back behind these trees, and
that's what we wanna do. There. It takes very little paint. Once again, the black gesso has done most of the work for you. Let it work for you. Shoot, be lazy. Maybe there's something that
comes out over here even, wherever you think it should be. I don't wanna cover up all
these little areas here. I wanna leave some of
them showing through, so when it's done, it'll look like you can look
through there and once again, see some of the little stones. Of course, it you cover them up, we can always go back and add
them right back in very easy. Now then, I'm gonna grab
another clean two-inch brush. I have several of them going. I wanna take the least
little bit of Titanium White, tapped right on the corner, just a little teeny, teeny,
teeny bit right there. Down here at the base of the waterfall, if water fell this far, it would churn and create a
tremendous amount of mist, so let's just do the same thing. We'll take the top corner of that brush and begin tapping, just tap. It's just basically Titanium White, and you start tapping here. I wanna create a nice misty effect, right down here. There, something about like so. All right, just by tapping, and you can fluff it a little bit, very gently. Now, the water hits, and you have that nice area down in there. Back to my brush with
the old tree color on it, tree limb color. I want some of these limbs
to be in front of the mist. Think about what's in the
foreground, and what's behind. Try to paint the thing that's
the farthest away first, and work forward. I know, you say it sounds
logical, and it is. It's really just common sense painting. You paint the thing that's
farthest away first, and work forward. There, wherever. Now, let's take our little liner brush, little liner brush, little
liner brush, little liner brush. We'll use that same color. I wanna make this paint
thin, like ink, very thin. Turn the bristles into the paint. That brings it to a nice sharp point. We'll go up in here, and here and there, and there and here, we'll just put the indication of a few little sticks and twigs, and all kinds of little
things that we can see sticking out through there. There, see there? Already, it gives the impression that there's all kinds of little
limbs and things happening, and you've done very,
very little, very little. There, wherever, wherever, wherever. Maybe on the other side,
we'll put a couple, so we don't want him left out. He'll get mad at you. There. Maybe there's even some old wiggly ones that hang right over here. There they are. If you have trouble making the paint flow, just add a little more
paint thinner to it. It just means that it's
not quite thin enough. There, sometimes there's some, there he is, right out over the waterfall. All these little things that
are in front of the waterfall help give that illusion that it's behind. That's what we're trying to do. We want to make it way
back in there today. I'll just use that same old brush, and go right into a little Cad Yellow, Indian yellow, Yellow Ocher. Once in a while, I'm gonna bump
a little of that Bright Red. Let me grab a little black on the brush. There, okay, just tap, push. See how that brush pushes
that little ridge of paint up? That's what we're looking for. Let's go up in here. Now, let's begin putting in the sparkles, the icing on the cake right here. This is it, all the little highlights. Think about shape and form, and how all these little
limbs grow in clumps, little branches. These are just a collection of bushes that got together and grew
big to make a big tree. Think about little individual
bushes that live in here. There we go. There, a little more color. There they go. See, you can do fantastic things with a great big old two-inch brush, if you just give it a little chance. That's all it needs, a little chance. Okay, right on over our waterfall. All right, there. Maybe here's another happy little tree. He lives right there. Well, he has some view, doesn't he? Wouldn't that be a nice place
if you were a tree to live? It would always be nice and damp. You'd have plenty of water. I'd like to have a little house here. I think a waterfall is one
of the most beautiful sounds. There we go. My mother used to love to
listen to the waterfalls. That was one of her favorite things. You might have noticed on the shows, I dedicated this series to her. Since the last show, I lost my mother, and my brother Jim and
I miss her very much. But this is the kind of
scenes that she liked. There, all right, all kinds of gooders. We have to decide what's gonna
be down here at the bottom. We can get crazy and just keep going. Let's put a little bit, just a few little things on
the other side over here, too. There we go. I really like these kind of paintings. I really like them, and they're so easy to
do with the black gesso. Before we had the black gesso, this was something that I wanted to paint but I couldn't figure out how to do it in the time frame that they
give us for television, because actual painting time is only about 26-and-a-half minutes
or something like that, and I have a mean old director. Boy, if I don't stop right on the money, she gets mad and comes out
here and yells and screams, and treats me rough. Not really, not really. I made that up. There we go. See all those little things? You can just make layer
after layer after layer. Each one of these will
help push that waterfall farther and farther back
into the background. There we are. Okay, there. A little bit right in there. We better make some decisions what's down at the bottom of
this waterfall pretty soon, or I'm gonna fill the whole canvas up full of beautiful little trees, 'cause I like to do these
little trees like this. Make them darker and darker down in here. It's a nice shadow area down here. You don't want a lotta
light down in there. Okay, let's make some decisions. Let's go with Van Dyke Brown and a little Dark Sienna mixed together Maybe in our world,
there lives, there lives, maybe there's a stone right there. I don't know, so you just sorta look, and everybody's painting
will be different. Don't just try to copy
what we've done here. Look at your painting. Painting should not just be copying. It should be doing your own thing. That's really what makes it fun, and that's the person you need to please is yourself. If you're happy with what you've done, that's what's important. That's really what's important. It's not what somebody else
tells you should be done, not in painting, anyway. Maybe there's a big
cliff over here (choo). There, just fill all of that. Because it's dark there, we
don't have to put much color. We'll take some of our brown and white, a little tiny row of paint on the knife, and just sort of let it
bounce along here and play. There, wherever we want it. Clean your knife off and you can come back and just sorta bring all that together. There. Make a big old mean stone right there, and all kinds of little
things that live back in here. Okay, mix up a little touch of color. I almost ran out of color. There we go. Just take the other colors
and bounce them around. Let the knife just touch,
bounce, jump, move, carry on like that. It'll make all of these
beautiful rough, rough places. That's what my doggie says, "Rough." Bounce it across there, just bounce it. Put a spring on the end of your knife. Just let it play (zoom). Over here, there, same old thing, maybe there's a big cliff that
ends right out through here. We don't know where it goes, and comes down. Maybe this is sorta washed out underneath. There we go. See how you can see things, though. Maybe it's sorta washed out. Light's just zinging through there. (choo) - There. Okay, good. Now, let's get crazy. I'm gonna take my fan brush. Take my fan brush and a little
bit of the Liquid Clear, go back into Titanium White, and get a little Thalo Blue
and Thalo Green on there. Get them both, not much. It's very strong. A little tiny bit of Liquid Clear, just to soften it up and make it slide across
here a little easier. Back in here, maybe the
water's coming along here, and goes (ploom). See there, it fell over. Look at there. Maybe there's a little
stone back in there, and a little splash (choo). You don't have to make those
noises, but it helps. (laughs) It does help. Maybe (choo), maybe there's
another little thing. There may be stones all
over the place here. See there? We don't know, but the color underneath is
constantly coming through, also. We had Thalo Green, Thalo Blue underneath, and all that comes through. Maybe (choo), I like all these little watery falls. There. Isn't that fantastic
that you can make water just move like that, any
way that you want it to. It just pours right outta there, and off it goes on a long journey. We don't know where it's gonna go. Well, we do know where it's gonna go. It's gonna end up in the ocean. We just don't know which one. There we go. Now, tell you what. This will be a super, yeah, mm hmm. I think maybe, I don't do this very often, but in nature, you always have old trees that have fell off into the water. Sometimes, we avoid putting them in here, but why not have one? Here's an old tree. I'm just using Van Dyke Brown right now, a little brown and a little
white here, mixed together. Come right back in here and just touch, just touch, put a little
highlight on that rascal. This old tree's just
fell off into the water, and it's laying here (choo). Some of the bark's still left on it. Take our little straight liner brush, and go right into our Van Dyke Brown. Maybe there's a big old limb here. Put it on with brown. Maybe there's some
little ones out in here, like that, wherever, a little brown and white, so we have a little highlight. I want that old limb to show up. You never even know, maybe, maybe this is real low right here, and the water is literally
coming over that (choo). This paint, I thinned it with
a little bit of Liquid White, so it's very thin, almost the consistency of Liquid White. That way, you can go right over
the top of that thick brown, without it all mixing together. Now, we have a little place
where the water just comes right over the old tree
that's laying out there. There, and maybe, shoot, we're having so much fun, let's get a little crazier here. Maybe there's a big old tree here. (choo) - Once again, you gotta
make those little noises. I'm just using a liner brush, but you can do this with
a fan brush or whatever. It doesn't much matter. It doesn't much matter, whatever, whatever you're comfortable with. Put a few little arms on him, just a few little arms. Somebody wrote a while back, "You've really lost it now, Bob. "You've given the trees arms." In the next series, we're
gonna give them legs. What the heck? I think in your world,
you can do anything. If you want your trees
to have arms or toes, it doesn't matter. There. Right out here, maybe there's just a little grass that grows right around his little foots. There, see, grass right out, coming
on there like that. Maybe there's a few leaves
on that little tree still. Use a little Yellow Ocher. You just put the
indication here and there, just a couple of little highlights. I don't want a whole bunch on that tree. Don't want it to cover up
all the fantastic things that are behind it, but just a few little things. There we go. See there? Now, dip the brush into
the least little amount of the paint thinner. I just want to thin this. We're getting quite a
few layers of paint now, so we need to keep the
last layer the thinnest. A little green, made by Sap
Green and a little yellow. Down in here, we can put the indication of a few little bushes and stuff that live right along here at the water's edge. They set up here on these big rocks. There, just like that. See that, and sorta have them hang over. We can take a little brown and white, and here and there. You know, if you have something
that hangs over like this, there's always little roots and stuff that hang over the edge, and you can make all kinds of little doers that hang off like that. It helps give a little
realism to your painting. There we are. There's all kinds of little things. All right, I think
we're about to the point we have a painting that's about finished. I'm gonna take a little paint thinner, a little Bright Red, and I think we'll sign this one. Once again, when you're
signing your painting, make this paint, look at there, it's literally running. You can see it dripping. It's that thin. Over and over, I have letters from people who say it's hard to sign. Keep it thin. Let's sign that rascal. Luckily, I have a very small name, and can do it very quickly. I hope you've enjoyed this one, and from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. (mellow music)
