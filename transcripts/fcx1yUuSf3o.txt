- Hey, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today, because today I'm gonna do
something that's very unique. I think you'll enjoy it. Let's start out and have
'em run all the colors across the screen that you'll
need to paint along with this. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've got going up here today. Today I've taken our regular
old canvas, pre-stretched double prime canvas, and I've
painted it with Black Gesso. I've allowed the Black
Gesso to dry completely, and then I've covered the entire canvas with a very thin coat of Liquid Clear, little, little amount. It doesn't take much. Then I've put a little bit
of Prussian Blue over it. Today I wanna show you how
to make an exciting effect on the canvas and then I'll change and put up a canvas that's already done and we'll continue on and
paint a happy little painting, so let's do that. As I say, I've got this
covered with Liquid Clear and a little bit of Prussian Blue. I want a blue hue to this. I'm gonna dip my brush into paint thinner. I'm gonna go into a little bit of brown. This is just a little bit of Dark Sienna, little brown, little blue, but
notice how thin the paint is. Now, paint thinner has a violent reaction with Liquid Clear and
we're depending on that to create some gorgeous effects. Okay, let's go up in here. As I say, this is very thin and once it hits this Liquid Clear, gorgeous things will happen. We'll just do something about like that. It'll continue to work
sometimes maybe 15, 20 minutes. That's why we're gonna change canvases, so it has time to work and dry, but I wanna show you how it's made. By just taking this brush
and doing something like so-- Get nervous. You can make some of the
most gorgeous effects you've ever seen. That easy. There, see, just let these
colors play and dance and maybe they come around. You can make big old
things that look like wood with big knots in 'em. It's up to you; you decide
what kind of design you want. There. Take a little white here and there, but it must be very thin,
have a lot of paint thinner, so that all these gorgeous little things will happen for you automatically. See 'em? Look at that. Already, they're beginning to work. As I say, the paint
thinner and Liquid Clear will have a violent reaction and you can turn the
brush to make effects. Just let it dance around on the canvas. If you don't like one, you can come back and go over it, and change it, because, as you know, this
piece of canvas is your world and you can do anything
that you wanna do here. There we are, something about like that. The blue underneath is being picked up and it will create a blue
hue to the whole painting. There, as I say, you can go back and forth and add color anywhere that you want it and just change this continually. There. That's basically all there is to it. You can just take paint thinner and go back over this, just
with plain paint thinner and it'll really cause it to separate. Experiment a little
bit when you're at home and you'll find many, many different ways of doing this and use
a multitude of colors. Don't just use the colors
that we use here on TV. Use any color that your heart desires. There. See how that's beginning to create all those beautiful illusions? Now then, as I mentioned,
I wanna change canvases and put one up that's already dry. To do that, let me just reach up here. Excuse me just a second. Reach right up here, take this one off, and I have one here
that's already been done, and I've put a little bit
of contact paper around it, just leaving a section open. I'll show you how you can take this and make a gorgeous
painting that's very simple and very, very easy. Anybody can do it. All right. Now, once again, this is dry. I've allowed it to dry and
you might wanna lay it flat while it's drying, depending
on how much thinner you put on the canvas when
you're producing the effect. All right. Now, let's start off and
we're gonna cover all of this with just Liquid White, just like we would on a regular painting. Just cover it. Normally, I have this done
when we come on the air, but I wanted you to see
this from start to finish, so you can make your
own masterpiece at home. There, just a very thin
little coat of Liquid White, just enough to sort of cover it up. About like that, that's
all we're looking for. There. That's all there is to putting
Liquid White on a canvas. Okay, now we get to wash the brush. (chuckling) If you've
painted with me before, you know that's my most
favorite thing on here, is washing the old brush. Actually, it's my way of getting even with the crew for picking on me. All right, shake off the excess and just beat the devil out of it and you can cover everything
in about a ten-foot radius if you're not careful. Okay, let's go into a little
bit of Alizarin Crimson, just a small amount on the two-inch brush. The painting I'm gonna do today-- Let's just do a very
simple little painting, easy little painting, because
it's really the background that I want you to practice with, and try, and fall in love with,
because it is so much fun. I'm gonna put a little
Alizarin Crimson right there, like that. We'll go right into a
little of the Prussian Blue. Same old brush. The Prussian Blue is so much
stronger than the crimson. You can do that without washing the brush. Go back up in here and we'll just start with
our little criss crosses, little X's, little X's,
something about like that. There. Okay, I'll tell you what, we will have a little water in this one. You know me, I love water. Maybe we'll put just a tiny
bit down here at the bottom. There we are, about like that. With that, we can turn this in, I think, to a very nice little painting. Let's wash the old brush again. I just want an excuse, just one excuse, to wash the brush. There. All right, fantastic, we got it. Now then, shoot, we'll
just use that same brush. It's working pretty good. I'm gonna go right into Titanium White. Just tap it very firmly. Tap it right into some Titanium and we'll go up in here
and maybe in our world there lives, yup, you're
right, a happy little cloud that just floats around here
and has a good time all day. About like that, it's the
easiest way I've ever found just to make a little cloud, just tap it. I've got several two-inch brushes going. Let me get a clean one here so I can just gently blend this very lightly. Three hairs and some air, just enough to blend it like that. I want another cloud in our world and he's gonna live right down here. Do one cloud at a time though. Don't get greedy. I know it starts working in ya. Say, "Well, I'm just gonna put
in a whole colony of clouds." Do one at a time. There, like that and we'll
just let it float on the way. Clean brush and once again just sort of blend it a little bit, just enough to bring it together, like that. Isn't that a simple way of making some very effective little clouds? It works and you can do it. You can do it. Yeah, all right. Now, get to wash the brush one more time, one more time. All right, we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner. (bucket clanging)
Kicked the bucket there. Okay, now then, let's do
a happy little mountain. We'll use some black, Prussian Blue, Van Dyke Brown, and Alizarin Crimson. We'll just mix 'em together. That's black, blue, crimson, Van Dyke. All right, and we'll cut
off a little roll of paint. See, it lives right out there
on the edge of the knife. Let's go up in here. Gotta make a decision. In our world, the mountain
lives right there. Right there, there it comes,
just a little mountain. He's got a little bump right there, something like so. It doesn't matter. Mountains are so fantastic to paint and it'll teach ya to use the knife. If you can use this knife,
make friends with it, shoot, you can do entire paintings with nothing but the knife. Two-inch brush, we're gonna
grab that and pull it. Just pull it, blend that color down. Because the canvas is
wet, you can do that. Has the Liquid White underneath. You can move color. It'll just slide right on there. If you were working on a dry canvas, we'd be in agony city about now. Because it's wet, we can
literally move that paint. We'll use some Titanium
White and put a little touch of Midnight Black in it,
just to grey it a little bit. Maybe even the least
little touch of Bright Red. There, but don't overmix it. I wanna leave it marbled. Once again, our little roll
of paint lives right out there on the edge of the knife. Let's go up in here and
now we come in here. (wooshing) No pressure,
no pressure at all. Just barely graze the canvas. Just let the knife float, let it float. Just let it slide right down the canvas. There, maybe over there,
yup, little bit of light striking right over in there. You decide; that's what's
so fantastic about painting. You make the big decisions. You can create any kind
of illusion that you want. I'm using a little
Prussian Blue and white. Mix it together and we'll
make a little shadow color for our mountain, blue and white. That's good enough for what we're doing. As I say, we're just going to do a very simple little painting. Little roll of paint. Simple painting that probably
won't be any challenge at all for you, but I wanna
show you this background. When you do your painting, you can make it much more complicated. Here, we have limited time and a director with no sense of humor, so we'll just do something simple. All right. Maybe we will put a
little duder right there, just to break up that shape some. Then go back, fold a
little shadow in there. Shoot, that easy. We've got a little
mountain, little mountain that lives right there on our canvas. Nice clean, dry two-inch brush. It really needs to be dry now, 'cause you'll destroy your
paint if it's not dry. Then blend upward. We're taking out the tap marks, sort of bringing everything
together when we do that. Always following the angles that are in your mountain, most important. See? There. Maybe just bring that on
down a little bit further. There, see? Like that. That's all there is to it. Give it a little upward lift. Shoot, we're in business. That gives us a little mountain that looks like it's far away. We're not too worried about it today. Let's take-- What'll we use? Let's take Prussian Blue,
some Midnight Black, and we'll take Titanium White. I wanna make several
different values of this. Gonna make some little foothills that live way back in the distance, little trees that are
growing far, far away. We'll put some white in
there about like that. Okay, let me clean off the old knife. Then let's grab us a, we'll use a number six fan brush today. Blue, and black, a little white, load a lot of color into the brush. Let's go right up in here and maybe, maybe, yeah, some little evergreens. Maybe those are evergreens;
I don't know what they are. Whatever they are, they live far away. You decide what they are in your world. You want it just dark
enough so that it stands out from the background. That's all you're looking for. As light as you can get
it and still make it stand out from the background. I think we'll put several layers, so be sure this is as
light as you can get it, so we can get progressively
darker as we move forward. Clean, dry two-inch brush, little mist down here at
the base, just tapping. I'll add the least little bit
of Titanium White to that. I want it to be a little more misty. Then lift upward just enough
to take out the tap marks, sort of bring everything together. There. As I say, we can put several
little layers in here. Maybe there's another layer. Yeah, it lives right there. There he is. You decide. Painting offers freedom. On this canvas, you can move mountains. You can do anything on this canvas. Maybe I'll have a little
reflection right there, so we'll just pull it down. Grab old two-inch brush again. Pull straight down; pull across. Shoot, we got misty reflections. Take a little Liquid White and put a little Liquid White out here. Pull it out very flat, like
so, flat as I can get it. Then cut across. See, so there's a little bit of paint right up on top of the knife. Then we go back in here and figure out little
waterlines that live in here. There they come, there. Just a little indication,
that's all we're looking for, something about like that. There. All right, now we can just
continually move forward. Make it a little darker. Same color, just darker. I'm just taking a little of the dark, going right into the light with it. Each layer is just a little bit darker. This one, bravery test. Maybe comes all the way up
here, all the way up there. There we go. I wanna push those mountains so far back that they look like they're way back in the distance somewhere,
just hiding back here, having a good time. There we are. There they come and they
come right on down... we don't know, maybe
down in here somewhere, push up, give it a little upward lift. All right. See how easy those little
distant trees are to make? You can make layer,
after layer, after layer. It'll make your painting look very deep, very deep, have depth
in it, a lot of depth. Take some of that same color. Let's pull it down. Make us a little reflection right there. Go across. Back to our Liquid White. Guess we better get some on the knife. There, like so and we'll just put in
another little waterline that lives like there. Now maybe, I tell you
what, I tell you what, let's have one more
(chuckling), just one more. Going to a much darker color now. It's almost a pure color. Got a little white in it, but
almost the pure dark we made. With that, see how that stands out? Each layer, though, needs
to get progressively darker as it comes towards you. That's what gives a
landscape depth and distance. It's most important. It can be your best friend. There. Some little duders live out there. Once again, let's have a reflection. I like reflections so much, so much and reflections are one of the nicest, easiest things to do in this technique. When I was a traditional painter, it used to drive me crazy, but in here, you see how easy they are to do. All right, take a little
more of the Liquid White. We'll just put the indication
of a little waterline there and have something like so. All right, but doesn't that
create a lot of depth in there? That easy, that easy. Now then, tell you what, I
wanna pull the contact paper off and show you what we have. Show you that gorgeous
background that we made and how well it works. Look at that. Isn't that wonderful? Makes a beautiful little
painting when you do that, but you know me. You know me, shoot, I got
to get a little crazier. Let's take a little bit of black, with some Van Dye Brown,
a little Dark Sienna. We'll just mix 'em all
together on the brush here and we'll give you a real bravery test. I like big trees. If you've painted with me before, you know I do like big old trees and here comes one. Maybe it comes (grunting)
off here and back down. I don't know; wherever you want it to go. Boy, there is a big tree. It goes all the way off the canvas. Monster tree, that's the
kind that'll chase you across the yard if you're not good. Yeah, there we are. Big old tree, strong tree. Okay, something like so. Look at this background. Isn't that fantastic, what it looks like? It's one of the neatest things
that we've come up with. As I say, I mentioned
it earlier in this show, try it in a multitude of colors. You just can't believe what you can make. My partner, Annette Kowalski's
gonna do some flowers on backgrounds like this. She paints gorgeous, gorgeous flowers. You might've saw here in the last series. Little roll of paint, black and white. I can't wait to see flowers on this. I'm just gonna touch, just put a little
highlight on this rascal, about like that,
something about like that. We'll just put the
indication of highlight. We don't wanna go into too much detail. Just to show you how it's done, then set you loose on the whole world. Because once you learn this,
you experience freedom. Canvas and paint, ah,
what you can do with it. You can create any illusion that you want, just literally any illusion. Little Pure Black on the outside side here and we'll just sort of bring
'em together a little bit. Want that tree to be very
strong looking, tough old tree. There we are, just a big old tough tree. We'll take our script liner brush, paint thinner, and we'll get quite a bit of paint thinner here. Put it right in the
black, right in the black. Make this paint very thin,
almost like ink again, very thin. Now, let's go up in here
and let's put some limbs, some arms on our tree (grunting). See there? Now, if you have trouble making that flow, all you need to do is add a little more paint thinner to your paint. There. Big old rascal, he just lives out here and has a good time. When you're at home and
have unlimited time, you can just put details,
details, details in this. It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. There, wherever, okay,
something about like that and we just let him go, let him go. Some over in here, but I like paintings that have borders and then
you break the borders. There, since we've introduced
the use of contact paper in painting, I think it's
almost become a standard. I see artists all over the
country doing that now. It just opened so many
doors to the imagination and that's what art's all
about, is imagination. There. All right. We need something for that tree to sit on. He's just sort of
hanging out there in air, which is all right, but
we'll put something on. We'll use some brown, blue, black, little Sap Green in there too, little bit of color on the brush
and let's go up in here and we need to put, as
I say, some ground here. Maybe there's a little
bush lives right there, just happy little bush. Maybe there's a couple of them. I don't know, wherever you want 'em, something about like that though. There. Take that same brush,
dip it into a little bit of paint thinner to thin it,
go right into the yellow, and we have instant green. Little Yellow Ochre, I'll
hit some Indian Yellow once in awhile, and every so often a little bit of Bright Red. There and with that, let's just start making the indication of
some happy little bushes that live down here. These are outside of the little rectangle that we made there. There, maybe some nice
little grassy areas. See 'em? There they come, there they come. Wherever you want 'em,
that's where they should be. There, something about like that. All right, take the knife. We'll take a little Van Dyke, Dark Sienna, maybe put the indication
of a small amount of soil, dirt, down in here. Little brown and white,
touch it about like that. Come back. I'm dipping the brush into a
small amount of paint thinner once again, just to make the
paint a little bit thinner, so it'll stick on top of
here without any problem. As you know, a thin paint
will stick to a thick paint. There we are. See there? Something about like that. Isn't that fantastic? You can do a little painting that quick. All right. I'm gonna get crazy. Got a minute left. Van Dyke Brown, Dark
Sienna, mixed together. You ready? Right here. Maybe it's what remains
of a piece of an old fence that used to live out
here, but it's about gone, it's about gone. It's like me; it's had
a hard, tough old life. Tired old fence. Maybe there's one more
little post right there, something like so. Little rails still left there
and maybe even one there. I don't know; it's up to you. Dark Sienna, little white
to make a light brown. Just touch, let some of
that just show a little bit, little highlight here and there. Little on this one and
that little baby one there. Take a little red, put
a little red on top, just a little sparkler. Shoot, I think we got a finished painting. Gonna call that one done. We'll take a little paint thinner, little bit of the bright red. Let's sign this little rascal. We'll sign him right down in here, about like that. All right. Hope you've enjoyed
this one and once again, give this a try. There's so many, many different things that you can do with this basic idea of a black canvas and Liquid Clear. Until next time, from all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. (relaxing guitar music)
