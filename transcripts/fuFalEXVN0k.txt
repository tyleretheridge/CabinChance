- Well here we are ready to go again, you have your brush set up and the almighty easel ready, let's do it. I've already covered the canvas with a thin, even coat of Magic White, so it's wet and ready to go. So let's start out today with a little bit of thalo blue. Just take a little bit on your brush and beat it into the bristles so you get a nice, even distribution of color. We'll start right up here at the top, just making our little
criss-cross strokes. Little Xs, there we are. Now, let it blend downward, just do it in layers, working downward. Automatically, your brush is picking up the Magic White, and it gets lighter in value as it goes
down toward the horizon. There. Most of the sky is going to disappear, I think we'll do a bubbly
little stream today. A lot of little trees
in the background, and just see what happens. Okay, now we can gently blend that out. And we're ready to go. So let's just take the big brush, and we'll go right into
some van dyke brown, little bit of sap green, just use a big brush,
don't be afraid of it because it's big. Some brown and sap green, maybe a little crimson,
we'll throw a little alizarin crimson in there, too. Now, let's go right up here at the canvas and figure out where we're going to have some almighty trees and stuff. All we do is touch, bend the bristles. Bend the bristles. Turn the brush in the direction you want the leaves to go, and
the limbs to lay there. And all we're looking for now is just some basic background shapes. Okay, we'll put a little
more color in the brush here. Just drop these in, all
you're looking for basically is a nice dark color so our light color will stand out on top of it. Okay, maybe this one lives right here. Just sort of let your imagination take you from one place to another. Don't worry about it, these are just background trees. Now, while we have the brush dirty, we can just go right in here and fill in some of this area. This is mostly van dyke brown, just using the same old dirty brush. Little green, lot of brown. If we're going to have a little
stream coming through here, begin working on the lay of the land. Let these come down in angles, like so. So it creates a depression here, so the water will sit in it. There. We've got this painting half done already. Okay, maybe a little bit
more right over here. Once again, all we're doing is laying in some nice base color. Not worried about detail yet. Okay, now, let's take the fan brush and let's load it full of van dyke brown, little bit of umber, this is burnt umber. Little burnt umber, van dyke brown, on both sides of the brush. Then I'm going to take and just pull one side of the brush through white. So we have brown on one
side, white on the other. And we'll go up here and
we'll touch the canvas, and just pull straight
down, and make us some indications of tree trunks. And by double-loading the brush, we have the highlight and the
shadow in one stroke. A little brown, a little white. And these are your
trees, so you can decide how many trunks are in here. Whatever makes you happy. Okay, let's go, maybe
there's a little trunk right in here, just a little
bit will show through. There's one. Okay, maybe there's one over here, maybe he's got sort of a crook in him. All tree trunks aren't
straight, so sometimes make some with little crooks in them. There we go. Now we can start putting some
highlights on these trees. And we'll use the one inch brush, a little bit of Magic
White to thin the paint, use some cad yellow and sap green. Cad yellow and sap green. And just mix color on your brush. That way, you have a multitude
of colors on your brush rather than just one flat, dead color. There we go. Now, let's just go right up in here and just begin applying some highlights. Go slightly above the dark. And just bend the bristles. Put some leaves on some
of these trees back here. Just let them fall right off your brush. And we'll take a little bit
of the yellow ochre now. Start putting some bright
little colors in here. Maybe this one right here. There we go. There. Just let those leaves just
fall right on the tree. I've added a small, small
amount of permanent red. Maybe we'll get something in here that's a little bit brighter,
in the orangey colors. Okay. Little yellow added right
to that, we can come right back up here and
do this nice little tree. This little tree really is pretty. It has a very nice little shape to it. A little bit over here. There we go. And that gives us some
nice background trees. And we'll take a little
more of the sap green, and use the brush sideways. Touch, push. Bend upward. Just make it bend upward. And we'll put some little bushes and stuff way back in the background. Not looking for a great
deal of detail yet, as we come forward, then
we'll worry about detail. Right now we just want to
fill up some of this area with a little color. There. And when you start these paintings, all you need to have in your mind is the time of year, and the time of day. And just sort of let them happen. Let them happen, don't spend a lot of time worrying about what you're going to paint. Just start painting, it'll happen and you can see it on the canvas. Okay, we'll put some highlights on the big tree here, and
we'll just use some green. Here we go, a little sap green. We'll make it a little bit darker, and add a little bit more green to it. There we go. That's what we're looking for. Just some indications back here, we're not worried about
a great deal of detail. Okay, that gives us something
to work with back there. And maybe if we're going
to have a little stream that's flowing down through here, maybe we need to start
putting some rocks and stuff sort of to contain the stream and keep it inside of its boundaries. So we'll just use some van dyke brown, little bit of umber in it. Van dyke brown, a touch of burnt umber. And just sort of touch the
canvas, and let the paint just glide right off the knife. You're just barely touching. You want the paint to break like this. And hopefully, by the
time we're finished here, this will look like little rocks. See this, touch and just sort of follow the lay of the land,
once again, we want to keep the water down in a recessed area. And we're not too worried about
shapes and stuff right now. And a little bit right over in here. Right now, we're just
worried about putting the undercolor in. Then we'll come back
and begin highlighting. There we go, we need the
dark in order to show light. Okay, now, we'll make a little
highlight to put on these little strokes that are
going to end up being rocks. So we'll take some van dyke brown, white, and a touch of prussian blue. Just a touch, blue is so strong. And sort of make a little grayish color. There. And leave your paint
marbled, don't over work it. Leave it so you can see
color swirling in it. Now, very gently, just
barely touch the canvas. Just so it grabs the high points. Just barely, barely touching. You don't want to overdo. You could very easily
kill all your dark color that you worked so hard to put in there. You don't want to hurt
that, you need the dark. We're just making the bottom
of the stream bed, here. Following the lay of the
land is so, so important. Okay, now we can take the fan brush, little bit of yellow,
sap green, and we can get over here in the
ochre a little bit, too. Just mix all these colors on your brush. Just let them mix on the brush. Now let's go way back into
the background back here and begin putting some
little grassy areas . Maybe there's a little meadow back here. Quiet, beautiful little place
that you'd like to go sit and listen to the stream bubble. I think streams make
such beautiful sounds. There we go. Now, I'm going to take
a little Magic White, and mix it with the titanium white. I just want to thin this
paint down a little bit. Once again, our golden rule: a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So I'm thinning it just
a tiny, tiny bit here and we'll begin putting in some water for our little stream. And maybe the little stream
comes from right there. And it just sort of
comes right over like so, and right in here, maybe there's a little oh, there it went, it fell right over. Just let it drop, let it drop off. See how easy that is? When it hits down here, and there'll be a little splash down in here. When you're doing this at home, try both sides of your fan brush. You'll find one side of the fan brush bends better than the other side. Okay, a little more of the Magic White to keep the paint good and thin. Just barely touching here. Barely, barely touching. Maybe it falls again right there. Your stream, it can go
anywhere you want it to go. Maybe it goes both ways. Touch, make a little splash when it hits. Maybe, oh look it there,
there's another one. There's another one. He's just going every which-way. A little more of the Magic White. Okay, now, even though this is going to be covered up with little foamy things, there's still a reflection in the water, even if you can't see it, it still picks up the color from up here. So I'm going to take a little
bit of the prussian blue, a little van dyke brown. Just a little blue, the
blue is so, so strong. And right in here, let's drop in some little reflections. Just like so. Just touch, and pull straight down. It's most important that
you pull straight down. You want your reflections, even if they're under the water here, to look natural. So pull them straight down. There we go. Now, very gently, just like
we were making still water, we need that dark color underneath so our water shows up. Now we can go back into the titanium white thinned with a little Magic White, and maybe right there there's
another little drop-off. Maybe these just sort of come around. Just let your imagination go crazy. Don't worry about it. We don't make mistakes;
we have happy accidents. You learn to work with
anything that happens. Very very rapidly, that's
what's so fantastic about this technique. You don't have to worry about mistakes or accidents, we don't have them. It's very easy to repair
anything that happens, to fix it, to change it,
you can change your mind right in mid-stream. There we go. Just some little actions
out here on the water. Now, let's go back to our brush that has the green on it, and the yellow. Little yellow ochre. Once again, just use your
brush to mix these colors so you have a multitude of color happening on the brush. And we can begin working with our little grassy areas some more. And that's why you didn't
have to worry in here when you were putting in all the rocks. Anything you don't want,
you just cover it up with a little bit of grassy area. Very soft, quiet little grassy places. Nice place to go lay and
read a book or something. Look at the birds, talk
to little bunny rabbits. Okay, maybe, now we need
to close up this side, so it's contained, so we'll
just start right up here, and just push that
right up over the water. There, now it's contained, you don't know where it's coming from. But you don't have to
worry about it anymore. And we can drop some more
little things right in there. Just sort of close all this in. Now, by loading the brush
with several colors, if you load the light color first, go into the yellow first,
and load it very deep, and then your other
colors, try to keep them on the tip of the brush. Then when you're painting
along and you want, if you want just a regular
color, you just push, if you want a bright
color, you push very hard. And you can get a nice,
bright color, okay? There we are. Well, we're going to have to figure out what we're going to do here pretty soon. Maybe, maybe, this comes down here, let's get some more brown, maybe this comes right
down through here, like-- oh, look it here, that's what it does. It comes right across like this. Maybe there's a big old
stone lives right here. And maybe this comes
down, right through there. This is just van dyke
brown with a little bit of burnt umber in it. Little bit of burnt umber, not much. Then we can just sort of fill this in. There we go. And we're really not worried
about anything right here. Just drop it in. Let it happen. Okay, and we just throw
a little bit of color all over here, too. This is just the dark so
our light will show up. Okay, now we can go in here and let's get a little more of our
highlight color, huh? Some van dyke brown, white,
touch of prussian blue. Just to make a nice gray color. And lets put a nice little
highlight right out here on this little rock. There we go, just a little highlight. Just bring them right on down. Okay, well. Follow the lay of the land. I know you're tired of
hearing me say that, but it's so, so important. Okay, that gives us some
nice little rocky areas here. Go back to our fan brush, and some of the yellow ochre, cad yellow, little sap green and just begin dropping in
some little grassy areas here. You don't want to cover up all of these nice rocks that you've
made, just some of them. Leave some of them showing. Just like so. There we are. There. Okay, now let's go over
to the other side, here, and we can bring all this together. There we are. If you find that your
paint will not stick, add a little Magic White or
a little paint thinner to it, something to thin it down. The thin paint will stick
very easily to the firm paint. But you've got to start
with that firm paint. Okay, now, a little more Magic
White, and titanium white, and maybe, maybe this little stream here comes right over and
falls right over there. Just let it fall. Splashes a little bit,
and there it goes again. It's just wandering all over the woods. Maybe it comes out this way. Wherever you want it to go. You just have a little, it looks like a little bitty waterfall right there. Okay, now we take just a clean knife, and we just scratch a few
little trunks and sticks here and there. Just here and there. Wherever you think there might be one. And let's put a couple little trees in. Let's start off here with
just plain van dyke brown. And maybe there's a little
tree that lives right here. Maybe he's a crooked little tree. There he goes, all we're looking for here is just a basic shape. Maybe there's another
little limb that comes off, wherever you want it, right there. Maybe there's one that hangs out over the water a little bit. Just let it go. Give him a little foot here to stand on. Maybe there's a limb
right up through here. Okay, put a few little
limbs here and there and then we can put some leaves on it. There. If you have trouble
making this knife work, you can do this with a liner brush, all you have to do is thin the paint down with a little thinner or light oil, and it'll work fine. Okay, there's his little foot. Now let's take a little
bit of burnt umber, touch of van dyke brown. Little bit of white,
tiny little bit of white, just to brighten it up a little bit. And let's just go along
here and begin touching. Just to put a little bit
of highlight on this tree. There. Wherever you think the light
would strike this trunk. While we're in the tree business, maybe we need one on the other side. Maybe over here, maybe a
little bit closer to us maybe there's a much bigger tree. There he is. Just straight van dyke
brown to start with. We give him a little root
that just goes right down, follows the lay of the land also. Quite a bit of paint
here, I want this tree to be very thick. Then we'll come right up through here. Give him a nice limb. And trees grow however makes them happy, so there's really no
absolutely correct way to make a tree. Depends on the individual tree, depends on your mood a lot: how do you feel today? Does this tree have a lot
of limbs, or few limbs? Just let your imagination go. I see another one right there. Maybe there's one that comes
from back here somewhere and just sort of wanders off, like that. Put a few little leaves,
limbs, here and there. There we go. Now, let's take a little
bit of the highlight color. I'm going to add a little
tiny bit of blue to that. So we have some blue, white, little bit of burnt umber. This tree's a little older, he's tired. And we just touch, just touch. This is a nice little gray color we're using for a highlight here. And when this tree
dries, you can feel this. His bark will be raised, it's
quite heavy, quite thick. There we go. Ooh, that's a fine
good-looking old tree there. Now, we'll take a little bit of, we'll just mix it on the brush here, little bit of sap green,
some van dyke brown, a little prussian blue. We need a good dark color. And we can begin laying
some leaves on here. And we just put these in at random. Just sort of look at your basic shape. There we are, okay. Just basic shape. There we are. Okay, and sometimes,
maybe there's some leaves that are growing down in here. Don't want to kill all the background. Okay, we'll put just a few out here. Need the dark in order
for the light to show. There we are. Okay, just drop your leaves in. Need the dark back here
so the light will show. This one hangs right over the stream, that'd be the place to sit. Right under that tree,
and watch the stream, listen to it. Okay, now we can take, I'm going to use cad yellow, a little tiny bit of green in it, I want quite a bright color
here so it stands out. So, a lot of paint in the bristles. And, go slightly above the dark, and begin laying in
your little leaves here. Just drop them in, wherever
you think they'll be. There, painting doesn't
have to be a mystery. It doesn't have to be hard. All you need to do is
learn the basic technique, and practice a little bit. There. A few little bright
leaves, right out here. There we go, a few right in there. We've just about got
this little tree done. Now, let's get into a
tiny little bit of ochre, and sap green. I want a little different color than I have on the other one, so they stand apart a little better. Now we can go right along
in here and drop it in. Look at there, just drop
those leaves in that quick. No big deal, just enjoy. Don't kill all the dark areas, we really want to save some
of these nice dark areas. Little bit right in here. Just like so. Maybe a little grass
down here at his foot, just to cover up the foot. And I think we've just about
got a finished painting there. So, on behalf of all of us here, I'd like to wish you happy painting, God bless, we'll see you next week. (jazzy refrain)
