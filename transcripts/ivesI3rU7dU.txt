hey welcome back certainly glad you could join us today because here we are the last show of the 25th series so I thought today we'd just do a little painting it's a lot of fun and I think you'll enjoy it so let's start out and have run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us while they're doing that let me show you what I get done up here I have my regular 18 by 24 inch pre-stretch double prime canvas or you put you use any size is convenient for you and I've covered the entire canvas today with just a very thin even coat of the liquid clear so it's all wet and slick and it's ready to go so let's just do a fun little painting today how many I do run today just just using a 2 inch brush basically a few nice colors and and just just sort of let it happen just sort of let it happen we'll take a little bit of the Prussian blue very little when you're using this liquid clear you use very little paint normally very little hey let's go up in here and maybe we'll just take that blue and we just dance in a just a happy little sky takes a very little color though very little color it almost look like a wash when it's done there maybe I'll add a little black to my brush and blue blue and black and yeah just change a flavor a little bit here and there there maybe we'll do a little winter scene today and for that I'll make it make it just a little grayer but on little hand let's light a little crimson and and make it Sparkle a little bit this piece of camp is truly is your world and in your world you paint anything you want to use any colors that you want just whatever makes you happy they're just something my cabinet but this is a very very transparent color on top of it clear but if you want to make the indication maybe a happy little cloud up or you can just take the corner of the brush a very small amount of titanium white for example and just spin in using top corner just spinning round it around around just like so and create the illusion or just maybe a happy little cloud shape that's far or we just barely can see it and it just sort of floats around there and has a good time something about like if all right you may be okay tell you what let's make us a nice brown color we'll use some alizarin crimson and SAP green in about equal proportions I think this is one of the nicest Browns made I like making Brown out of these two colors there we go cuz you can sort of take it to the ready side or the green side depending on the mood or or what you're trying to achieve in your painting see me watch the old knife off there we just wiped the knife on a paper towel I breast seems to be doing okay we'll just keep using it tap just a very small amount of it very very small amount into the bristles like so I'm just tapping in the top corner the team now maybe might even wipe off any excess I want very little color that's good if you wipe it a little more I want very very little color it here on just makeup indication just a happy little tree that there's far far better in the distance far away there don't want a lot of detail too far away we're just going to put some very gentle little shapes just barely can make out what they are they're too far away there we go something like so sometimes it's nice when you using this clear to give the indication of light coming through so for that I'm going to take a little hand in yellow a little yellow ochre once again very very small amount of paint down in here I'm just going to tap some of this I'm gonna have some trees in here and this hopefully will come out looking like this maybe do some back light coming through there you could also do this using but white just so with a little bit of yellow acrylic in it and put them down before you start painting today I've always just do it this way it doesn't matter that no matter doesn't matter maybe put a little sky up in here to cut the heck well I got that old brush maybe some of that will show through I'm not sure exactly where we're going to have trees or we're not so we just put a little color on the canvas in case now then I'm going to use all kinds of the lizard Crimson a little touch of black but once again I can't say it enough I'm using such a small amount of paint it's almost not worth talking about it so small there we go and change the flavor a little bit so it stands out there very very small amount of pain there I want this to be very soft almost like a watercolor sometimes I'd like to do oil paintings that have a watercolor look to them and this is one of the ways that we do it okay all kinds of things maybe over here a little more that Brown that we made it would just happen just have an indication of a little bush and we just let them fade right on down to nothing right on down to nothing when you do your painting you may want it to be a little brighter a little stronger it's up to you I'll show you a little trick yeah this is fun take a liner brush and shake off all the excess paint you might even wipe it on a paper towel and then very lightly just touch the canvas and we'll make the indication of all kinds of little sticks and twigs just with a clean brush and you're just that paint thinner on there reiax it reacts with a liquid clear and you can make all these things using nothing it's just removing paint sometimes we apply a paint sometimes we remove it depending on what we want to accomplish takes a minute for it to come up and look at there see wherever you think you should be one that's the right place and if you want to make it look like a watercolor paint sometimes you can also take fan brush put some paint thinner on it shake off all the excess thinner just really shake it off then go up here and flick it just flick a little paint than a red own to that color and once again the paint thinner and the liquid clear will have a violent reaction and you'll get all these gorgeous little things right in there they will flicky them a little up here you decide where you want it something like so I like to put it right down at the base of all these trees and bushes and stuff and I sort of like that effect and you can work in layers when you're doing that you can put put some in and put a layer underneath it and just keep working layer after layer it helps create that illusion of depth and distance in your painting and tiny that's what makes your painting special maybe there's another little tree that lives right here wherever there we go this is a nice way of making indication of little trees and bushes if you've had problems make them any other way because here all you do is add a little color to the tip top of your brush and just happen and they almost happen automatically there we go maybe this is a winter scene okay let's have some nice snow in here I like to do winter scene sometime that have a lot of warm colors in winter scenes can get so cold you almost have to wear coat to work on it so let's take a hold fan brush a little bit of the titanium white maybe I'll put a little touch of that little touch you the Prussian blue in there just to blew it down see there but just a little I wants to look like maybe is a little tiny bit of shadow that's not let's go up in here then we can take a little brush and go back in here begin picking out areas that we are looking for that easy gonna lift up so it just disappears back here see there just work right around that Bush you just put things wherever you want them just lift it up lift up that easy there oh I look sort of cold already sort of cold already there we go wherever you think these things should be let's take a little blue flag put some white in it don't it too strong blue and black and maybe maybe right in here I'll do something about like that but notice we're curving these strokes curving a little go right on off like apples and what I'm doing I want to make maybe the indication of a little Bank here like maybe there's a little stream it lives right in here maybe it's all frozen and all we can see is this little little area right here they're seeing something like so now we go back to our white but in all kinds of little things there you could do this with it you could do this with a two-inch brush if you want to turn this using a little fan brush because it happens to be available doesn't matter doesn't matter there we go a little more titanium white on the brush and come right up to the edge here maybe occasionally it slides over see there just like so down in here we need a little bit of the white color something like that I thought I'll help create that illusion that maybe there's a little frozen Bank right there something like that these are the paintings are a lot of fun they're good paintings just sit down and and experiment with you know we did one painting in this series I sort of turned out to have an oriental look to it where we just sit down and we started playing and just working with color these little paintings here you can do the same way don't be afraid to experiment that's really where the fun of painting comes in the joy of painting it's in learning new things and experimenting doing things that that you've never done before that's what's fun maybe there's some little areas right in here somewhere I don't know just put a little blue in there and bring the white right up to it like that it'll look like a little like there's a little indentation there that easy I'm sort of sneaky but it works very well works very well all right let's go back and play with some more trees they're a lot of fun I'm gonna go back into that nice brown that I made from the SAP green and alizarin crimson just tap a little color right onto the brush there you can see it very little color very little no you get tired of hearing that but if I don't say it too much afraid afraid you're going to sock a big bunch of dark color up here and be very unhappy with me because it takes such a small amount of color to create this particular illusion sometimes you want to create other illusions and you do use more color but today I guess training I'm trying to create softness take a little blue little crimson mix it together we'll make a little little lavender recover I mean wipe off all that excess and I don't want much color we have the indication room here have another little tree another new trail is right there there we go I like doing all these little trees and bushes that really is some of the most fantastic things because I know there's all kind of little creatures I got to show you one more little feller should we've showed you several animals in this series I want to show you one more one more little fella that I think you'll just love this is a little baby raccoon just a tiny little thing I think he's one of the neatest little characters I'm just painting history while we're watching it I think he's just absolutely darling there by the time you see this though he'll probably oh he's probably going to be grown and long gone cuz doesn't take too long for these levels to grow up they grow up quite rapidly then we turn them loose because God intended for them to be free and I believe that's where they should be all right now then let's take an old fan brush or just a little paint thinner on it I want to flick it again like that just right down here at the base of that let all those little things just happen watch it that's exciting when that happens it just turns me on to watch all that I like that I'm saying is you let the camera stay there just second watch what happens see they just keep coming and coming in and you can do this and make great big ones or little ones you can make them even run sometimes and that's very pretty that's good thank you they're ahead of them let's go want to take a little break rid put into my into my titanium white just to give it a little pinky flavor but I don't want to set it on fire don't want to set it on fire it will put a little touch of snow it lives right in here they're just lift it upward something about my cap there we go I don't I just take and lifted up because it just blends it together and you can't tell where one stops and next one starts but very very soft this is a very gentle painting very soft okay let me grab dual brush let's make another little layer having fun making all these but notice that we complete one layer in this painting at a time and then come forward do one layer time work forward always working forward maybe right in here yep yep you're right there's another happy little tree just another bushy devil arias putting a little raccoon - I work with a lot of the rehab people all over the country and these little creatures are so important I just think I think you're so much fun to work with and to enjoy and maybe the greatest pleasure of all is after you've raised one up and he's doing well he was orphaned he's he's grown if he was hurt he's repaired and the greatest pleasure it's when you're turning loose and you see him go sometimes I'm big old softy so sometimes that's a little hard for me to do because I'm I sort of get attached to these Rascals but you have to remember you take a little cad yellow less bright that's nice you have to remember that's once again that's where gods were meant for them to be after playing in the bushes and the trees and all that they don't do well if you make pets out of them because they don't make very good pets even raccoons as cute as they are in their little usually when they grow up I get a little mean so we let them go for they get that mean cause when they get mean and they're ready to take care of themselves they don't need our help anymore they're okay look at all the different layers of plains if you want to call them such in this painting that's what creates that illusion of depth and distance on that top I'm gonna take a little phthalo blue I keep saying titled I meant Prussian blue don't have anything blue in this painting depression but you could use they look blue if you wanted a little bit on brushes go up here I just wanted in this particular painting a little cold or blue put a little blue right in here just to make some shadows with and we'll come back we're just white and go right back over and then those shadows then will be underneath and that neat but work back and forth between blues and some of you little pinks and whatever you can just do all kinds of wonderful things painting is so much fun it really is one of those things that it's a lot of fun there and I think only nice people paid a debt and I had traveled for many years and that's my partner she travels with me all over the country and we we do a lot of shows for PBS stations around the country and even in some foreign countries and I have never met a person who paints that's not a very nice person so I think it goes with with what you're doing and maybe I'm just very prejudiced I don't know I just I just thank nice people painting I'm gonna put an indication here in their little stick in a twig using just clean brush with paint thinner on it don't want these to stand up too much just here and there and they'll continue to work for a little while after you go away see that one's getting bigger and bigger as you sit there and watch it all you're doing is removing paint it's just you're removing paint and we can take a little paint then it was a little brown on it and here and there we can bounce him some that are little darker I don't want too dark when I'm too dark cable night there take a little bit Brown we made put a little paint thinner with it and maybe back here there's an old tree what's left of an old tree are got to make those little noises to get the crooks and the hurts and the pain it's in this old tree because he's had a hard life he's in a hard one times were tough when he was just a little guy there poor thing but he's okay now there little squirrel lives up here in his limbs they get along fine there sink a little tree in there now get a little more white on the brush reach right up here and grab a little bit pull it out so there's some snow right around his foots right around his foots maybe back in here just here and there you can make out a few more little things I don't want these to be too dark I wanted to be just almost hidden back here but they're there they're there all right you know me mm-hm it's time you paint with me very long you know how to like big trees and this being the last show of this series we should not end without a having at least one big tree let's take some Van Dyke Brown put on your bravery suit let's see where you're at today because we're going to put us a big tree right here using Van Dyke Brown a little dark see and I'm just sort of mixing them together using the old filbert brush today I think we'll do really a rough this one this one has really had a tough life when he was little maybe maybe a big deer came through here big big buck and stepped right on him hurt him oh really put some cooks in his back whatever there we go give him some Bigfoots he need a big ol foot to stand out here take all this abuse he's getting there we go see had a letter from a psychiatrist one time and he said I had really lost it I had even given the trees arms and foots I wrote him back and toting me out I had but it was my world and everything in my world was happy and if I wanted my trees to have arms and foots that was okay there but I get several letters from him very nice gentleman and he finally agreed with me I wanted arms and foot someone trees he so don't yes that's ok but in his world he had a little more sanity than I did he he didn't have arms and foots on his there we go I was putting on some little old limbs that live out here are these are tough look at all Rascals but I like a tree with character I get tired of just trees that are straight and standing tall and telephone companies out looking for him I like trees it really looked like so we've had some some interesting things happen in their life there and animals all like these kind of trees cuz had good places to hide alright we'll just take a little snow bring it right down from the foot here we will take it right up like heaven something like so okay a little bit of blue just to make a little shadow goes right into there like that let's take can I fix up a little Brown let's leave dark sienna a little fan back a little bike mix them together doesn't matter I'm gonna wipe off this brush we'll just keep using that filbert for the time being I'm just going to let it barely touch and graze but the indication here and there all kinds of things not when this dries this paint is very thick you can actually feel this bark on here Sam there they just let the brush bouncing play barely touch some of these limbs it'll come right on out some it won't depends on which side the tree you put them on it's up to you you can put them anywhere any way that you want them that's a ragged looking old tree in it that's a rough I don't even know if my squirrel could climb it yay could I still have squirrel eagerly brown squirrely girl who's lived with me for several years I don't like a little fence I think all right come right here there's a little post squirrely girl the veterinarians have told me has epilepsy and can never be never be released they told me about two years ago that she would only live for six more months and you know what squirrely didn't know that she's still hanging in there and she's doing fine I will make his fence there comes right around like in and maybe beyond that same maybe over here maybe this one comes right on off this is one of them it goes around oops oh we didn't make out and go away through he'd fall off we can take a little white and we'll put a little liquid white with it just to make it a little thinner we can come along in here but the indication of some nice snow things that are hanging around up in here there you could do this with a liner brush if you have trouble controlling a brush this big there's a little easier but I got using this today so it whatever doesn't much matter well that's a rough looking old fence - yeah I like I like painting so that having character style to them like this a little bit of that blue and white put some snow under this old trees foot there you pick up a little bit color that's just wonderful because you it will create the illusion of shadows in there and that's what we're looking for we're looking for some shadows in our world there like that all right that it something about like so we would take our little script liner brush a little bit of that brown color and maybe there's some weeds and grassy little things that grow all out in here cuz if this guy he probably took care of his fence about like I do mine he left the weeds just about II eat it up and take a little fan brush will use number three it doesn't matter though pop in a few little bigger weeds wherever you think they should be and you can put all kinds of little details in here it's up to you you have to make these big decisions you have to decide where all these little things live there's more see there and you just drop them yet see more little twigs and sticks they go Bush lives right there sure that liquid not down to really we have a pony we consign we'll take a little red will sign this one right down here and with that I'd like to bring this series to a close
