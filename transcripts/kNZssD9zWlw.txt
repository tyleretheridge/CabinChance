all right welcome back certainly glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting with me good tell you what let's start out and haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that let's go on up here I have my standard old pre-stretch canvas up here it's been covered with liquid white and it's ready to go so let's get started I thought today let's do a little winter scene maybe one ditz maybe one that's really cold and you'll have to put on your coat for this one's over so let's start out with a little touch of a prussian blue on the two-inch brush and just a small amount no more reach up here and grab a little the midnight black to a very little color both of these colors are extremely extremely strong so be careful with them be careful they'll eat up your whole world in just a heartbeat okay now we have those sort of just mixed on the brush I want to just sort of dance in it just all kinds of little things just take the brush in and do a little circles just little happy circles that expand in all kinds of directions just back and forth to one way then the other and just let it plate at all these little brush strokes happen don't stay in one place and keep mixing look like a back a big gob in the sky just keep the brush moving let it bounce and play and have fun just let it go maybe love darken this if it's darker out here and gets lighter toward the center then it'll automatically manic it'll bring your eye down to this lighter area see there we go just sort of let just bounce and play and have fun and here you know me shoot I love water I'm just my water fanatic so let's put a little bit of water in this painting I'll use exactly the same colors but blue into black or black and blue whichever whichever and let's just drop in a little bit of water both on the outside and light like so yes like so there then we'll go over to the other side add a little more paint to the brush and do the same thing I don't know exactly where we'll have water but wherever now I want to leave a little area open here where there isn't there's no no color nothing there but the liquid right and I'll show you why in just a second there we go but pull from the outside and if you start here and pull across you're gonna get great big marks that are very very difficult to get rid of okay wash the old brush well i steel brush there's a screen in the bottom of this can that I scrub the brush against the screen allows this that allows the solid materials to settle to the bottom and keeps you thinner relatively clean now with a clean dry brush I'm just going to grab this and go all the way across and that light area will remain there and it look like a sheen of light come and crush your water hundred diamond sort of sneaky huh we look for easy ways to do things what makes this style of painting so fantastic even if you've never painted it this will work for you there we go can't peer in the sky I'm just gonna take and just sort of wind this up a little bit just makes it and stirred all kind of directions but I'm using basically just the corner of the brush and I'm just sort of stirring it up just blending and mixing this little brush sort of slide around there I don't want to kill all these shapes that I've made but I want to diffuse them make them softer there okay now you could stop right there and have one very nice stormy looking sky and for a lot of paintings that would be just right and make you a beautiful sky but let's play a little bit today tell you what I'll take the other one-inch brush I'm gonna go right into titanium white I'm gonna load the bristles full of paint a lot of pain down the line of paint let's go right up here and maybe we're gonna have a bright area right in here and we'll put some clouds in but you can get tough here and just take the brush and sock it just a socket and then beginneth just blending outward just let all these little things just sort of happen and play see sort of look at your light airy isn't it and these shapes will just sort of happen automatically just sort of let them play and have fun in there wherever you think they should be that's exactly exactly where they were to be this is a fantastic way of making some beautiful beautiful sky effects just like so they don't blend and plane but don't stay in one place and just keep working if you do it'll end up looking like a big old cotton ball in the sky we want life in these clouds and action movement yes keep them going and keep them going look at all that all kinds of fantastic little things happening that easy there we go okay now then I have several brushes going so I don't have to wash them continually now then with a large brush I want to take just the top corner of the brush very top I just began blending the base of each one of these little individual shapes we've made just blend it using tight little circular strokes like so very gentle very chip just absolutely just barely barely caressing the canvas make love to the canvas gentle very soft there we go just whisper lightly and in your world you decide how many cloud you want and drop them in now beating the brush just to remove excess paint that's the best way to do it all you have to just beat the devil out of it and it'll take that excess pain out and you don't have to go through the entire brush cleaning procedure now then we want to fluff these clouds this is two hairs and some pear I mean just oh you're just barely touching lift about 30 like so just give them a little circular upward stroke there just like so just lift them up remove the excess paint and very lightly very lightly just blend the entire skies hmm didn't hit something that easy you have instant clouds there all right tell you what today today let's build some almighty mountains I like big old mountains lived in Alaska for over a dozen years and Alaska has some of the most beautiful mountain ranges in the world so we'll take some pression blues a midnight black little Van Dyke print and we just mix it together pull the paint out as flat as you can get it get tough with it huh pull it out cut across we have a small rule of paint there it is right out on the edge of the knife okay now maybe their lives in our world right here a little claw a little little mountain lives up here in the clouds and you just sort of decide where you want me and firmly very firmly push that mountain over right into the sky get tough with it can't tough the only thing you worried about is a nice top edge you could cure this what's happening anywhere else in this melt now we're going to take a large brush and we'll grab that paint a I'm gonna pull it downward if you can see the entire Mountain it's always more distinct at the top and it is the bottom so by pulling this paint down I get automatically it mixes with a liquid white and it gets lighter and lighter in value toward the base of the mountain there yeah then let's just take some Street Street old titanium white same way pull it out flat and cut across and get our small roll of paint again just like so and in with that take the point of the knife put it right up here at the top no pressure no pressure at all just touch the mountain and let it flow right on there it's that simple no pressure though probably the biggest single mistake made is applying too much pressure maybe there's a little bit on that peak right there we'll take a little pressure and blue and white just mix that together yeah we'll use that for our shadow color if you need a shadow color and a highlight color and same way we pulled it out get our little roll of paint now let's go right up in here and in the opposite direction let's just put some happy little shadows like so no pressure I can't see that enough times absolutely no pressure and you can continually change this mountain maybe now there's a see yeah that's the big little thing this right out here big peak what's your mountain so you can do anything that you want to defend little ridges here and there and that's all there is to it clean dry brush will tap them very lightly following the ankles and lift up bertin that creates warm mist at the base over here the same way always follow those angles in your mountain tell you what today let's have some flywheel use that same color that was black compression blue and pending through without flat and get our little roll of paint again always a little roll of paint it may be over here today on this side we'll put a monster mountain this will really give you some practice using a knife and if you can make mountains with this knife then you can make roads and houses stones oh anything some of the earlier series we've painted the entire paintings using nothing but the knife and mountains would teach you how to make friends with it and that's what you need you have to make friends with the equipment there once again oh you're worried about set a nice top shape take our large brush grab this paint and pull it just puppet it'll move because of the liquid lights on there it'll move and it'll mix if you were trying to do this on a dry canvas you'd be upset with me and I don't want you to be upset I want this to work for you because it's tremendous amount of pleasure in creating a painting that you see in your mind and with your own hands if you put on canvas it's a very very satisfying psychologist would probably tell us it fill some inner need I don't know about that it's just fun and enjoyable ok we'll go back to our white just plain old titanium white then let's put some highlights right on this mountain follow those angles alright just let that float right down on the side of the mountain no pressure no pressure I think I mentioned another series and as teaching my son Steve to pay thanks to tell him just just to pretend that if he wasn't careful his hand would float right off the canvas and go away that he was a whisper floating through the Melvin kind of a son of a gun can paint some mountains now their course he spends all his time trying to find his hand and float it away there will come right in here and drop in some little the shadows this is just blue and white there we go but you see it's just from this exercise what fantastic mountains can be made quite simply mixing up a little more shadow color here ran out Prussian blue and white yeah once again though you can go right back in here and maybe into your world you want to have a little peek right there see all you have to do is drop it in make a decision put a shadow behind it and as easy it becomes a separate and complete entity our clean dry brush oh shoot got air to myself I didn't put any shadows right there there you don't put a shadow behind each peak it doesn't look right it won't come out and play with you it go off and it'll go off and leave you okay let's just tap right here still following those angles lowest most important follow those ankles there see and lift upward very gently very gently always following those angles over here so in this direction but seeing just a couple of minutes you've made two planes to different areas of fantastic mountains traditional painter I might have spent a week just just to do that there we go feed off the excess and we're ready tell you what we just take it same old mountain color that we had that was Russian blue black Van Dyke Brown lorries gonna mix it back together here with a little white just to lighten it up till it looks about like so on me let me wipe my knife off and we'll find we'll find we get a little one-inch brush that's good now I'm just gonna tap the old one-inch brush right into this color just tap it that's all there is very easy and then let's have some little foothills and all you have to do is just tap on some color see all you're doing is tapping once again the only thing you worried about something nice top edge just relax let it go and enjoy that's the only prerequisite painting should make you happy should always make you happy if it doesn't make you happy you're doing the wrong thing there okay see and I'm started working in layers and leaving some little light areas in there and those will show up just working new layers and you don't care if you get some down here shoot we're gonna turn that into reflections so don't worry about it it'll be one of those happy accidents that turn out so beautiful learning to work with anything that happens anything it happens because God made trees and all shapes and mountains and all shapes anything that you do is right don't let it fluster you as they say in the south okay now all I have that color on the brush I'm just gonna grab this and pull a little bit of it down this will be our reflections like so just pull it straight down even though this is Kurd pull the reflection straight down do that there we go the street yeah reflections then we'll take a clean 1 inch brush and very gently very very gently you want to grab this in short little strokes quarter inch high type can begin lifting upward and layers starting at the top and working down just lift straight up straight up if you let them go to an angle it'll look like little distant trees and if they're at an angle it'll look like the winds blowing about a hundred miles an hour and all your trees are gonna fall over so even though it comes down the side of a hill or whatever trees still grow basically the majority of them will grow straight up they'll go up you're looking for the Sun in the light and all those good things this is one of the most fantastic ways there is of creating the illusion of a lot of little trees that are far far away just little foothills see and you can do it so quickly then we'll take a little bit of liquid weight on the knife they're gonna pull it out flap and I'm just gonna cut like it and get tiny little bit on right on the bottom of the knife and let's go in here and maybe there's some little little areas of snow they don't live up in there now sometimes the liquid white is a real thing you might want to add a little bit of titanium white to it just make it go up in there a little better you sort of you sort of have to test yours and see there but this is loaded on the bottom of the knife normally when we're making water lines we load it on the top of the night this is on the bottom okay we can take our large brush pull this straight down and straight down and straight down like stuff then go across mmm I gives us some instant reflections here now how we can straighten all this up clean up the bottom edge is bring it all together and have some little lines that patru doubt past this there keep these lines basically straight even though they're coming downhill keep them straight or to look like your water's gonna run right out of your painting maybe a little ripple here and there you don't want this water to run out on them run out on the floor and get your floor wet if you all these lines basically straight thanks and we can take her little one-inch brush and just grab this and lift a little bit of this white up also and that that'll set it in there bring everything together it looks like little snowy areas laying in between the trees there told you this was gonna be a cold one and it over here on the other side tell you what let's do clean office space here put that up there and save it for later let's take up big gob up black and blue put some brown in there mix up a pile of paint let me clean off my knife yeah let's use the old fan brush today take the fan brush and go right into that pile of paint load both sides full of paint a lot of paint a tremendous amount of color on the brush now there may be there's some big evergreens that live right there start off by just touching to give you a centerline as sort of a guide and use the corner of the brush as you work down the tree apply more and more pressure I'm still using the same corner but as you work down just apply it more pressure that little son of a gun slip right there and you right there and you brush all you got to do is scare amount just start at the top and working down and you put as many or as few trees in your world as you want just sort of look at it and make a decision and sometimes you can put the layers of trees by that I mean maybe there's four trees that are better far away say if you wanted to have some trees that were farther away maybe right here for example there we go now you want to make them smaller and a little bit lighter in color to show distance there's one just give up let's get my friend there everybody has to have a friend you need a friend there is another one and maybe even a third one whatever and we can just say I'm show you how to make a little Peninsula out here underneath they will drop in a little color take our big brush pull that down go across and that easy we have in our collections okay I will take Oh let's take little Prussian blue and don't touch it white like in a dark blue color here just on the one-inch brush and let's put in yeah that's pretty good some basic shakes are some nice little bushes that live here we will make some little snow-covered bushes today saying just have those come right on out wherever you want them everything you need this dark color in here in order to show light that's all we're doing right now is just putting in some shadows pain will come back and add in all the nice house they're back to my fan brush it has white white a little pression blue on it white impression blue let's go up here and just put the indication here and there of a little bit of highlight on these trees don't want much you put too much you're gonna lose this beautiful contrast just on these very dark trees then while we have that we can go in here put a few highlights in these little grassy areas just a few and with her knife little water line here that's just liquid white put us a little water line right in there that'll push all that back okay now we take a one-inch brush and I'm gonna dip it right into the liquid white can remember our golden rule a thin paint will stick to a thick piece of liquid white first and then into titanium white pulling the brush in one direction okay add it let's just go up here and begin creating all these little snow-covered bushes off wherever you think they should live that's where they ought to be okay do one bush at a time just one at a time don't get in too big a hurry just drop them in see there but now because that darks back here these will stand out otherwise otherwise they just sort of fade right into the background tell you what right here's a nice place for a little cabinet a little quick little cabin just scrape out a basic shape for the knife saying that's all you have to do take some Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna mixed in it see I make the far side of the roof yeah what come right down here put in this side of the roof yeah well put it in the front other side of the front and we need a little side here and that easy you got your cabin locked in we take some brown and white and just barely touch it whisper light just let this float right down this is an old Kevin boy it's seen its better day okay then we can do a cabin ectomy cut it off wherever we want it take a little brown just gives us the door just sort of highlight that cutting through make the indication of little boards this whole cabins been deserted out here by the trapper for many years but maybe there's still a little path here comes right out like yes see just little touch it white then back to our liquid white and titanium white we can come back in here look at that the whole bushes growing right over the side of that cabin nearly and you can put bushes all up and down where the old paths used to be he cuts his yard about like I do there we go and you take the knife just scrape in a little stick in a twig here and with that I think we've got a pretty good winter scene but try this you'll like it and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and I'll see you next time
