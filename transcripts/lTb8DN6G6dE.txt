hi I'm glad you could join me today it's a fantastic day only because you're here so I tell you what let's start out today I haven't run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let me show you what I've done I've got my standard whole 18 by 24 inch canvas but you paint whatever size you want I just use that because it's nice for the TV cameras and I've covered the entire canvas with a thin even coat of the liquid white so it's all wet and it's ready to go so let's go I must start out today with a smallest little amount of alizarin crimson this is the last show of the fifteenth series why it's a lot of shows each series has 13 shows time 15 comes out to a group but since this is the last show I though we just do at a fantastic little happy painting little traditional painting that just just should make you feel good when you're doing it let's start with a little bit of this crimson let's just put in a happy little sky here what the heck what the heck just use a little crisscross strokes just sort of dance it in maybe it goes right on over a little more color right on over wherever we want it wherever you want it now then I'm going to going to add a little more of the alizarin crimson and reach over here and get the LEAs little touch of phthalo blue proportionately much more crimson than blue the blue is a hundred times stronger I want to make a nice little lavender color here and there I want to put a little bit of lavender in this guy look at that wherever just want to really make it make it Sparkle a happy little sky just a happy little sky there still using the little crisscross strokes like so all there's to it okay a little bit more of the blue end up in here put a little more blue there now we're going to have a little touch of water I think in this painting I like water hope you do go back into my crimson just get a little bit on the brush and we reflect just a little bit down here for we're going to have some water there is a little bit go right into the phthalo blue and that's just put a little area just a little blue there see how that blends right into the right into the crimson that we have a little more blue we'll put a bit on this side all we're doing is putting a little color on the canvas at this point really doesn't matter doesn't matter right now we're just having a good time enjoying there let's wash your brush you'll scrub it there's a screen in the bottom I can that I scrub it against shake off the excess just beat the devil out it may have been with a clean dry brush still using a little crisscross strokes we want to blend this guy together very gently very gently this doesn't take much pressure all we're doing is just blending it together you don't want to be able to tell where one color stops and the next color starts there okay now when you're doing this at home I recommend that you you step back in your painting it's very difficult to see right close-up it's really hard to see step back oh six eight feet and take a look see and then you can tell exactly what you have okay watch the old brush will one more time I just like to wash brushes shake it off there we are okay okay okay let's see let's use we use a one inch brush I'm going to some titanium white load some color into the bristles let's just make some very simple little clouds today and they live in our world they live right up here and all I'm doing is just happy just happy it's all there is to it just happen see this would let that little cloud just float right on off the brush wherever you wanted to go there it goes there goes there goes just make up little stories about the little cloud that floated around had a good time just sort of seemed in your mind they're dropping right up here anything the mind can conceive you can paint it you can paint there there's a little cloud maybe he's got a little friend this right there as many or as few as you want in your world just drop them in there he goes right on off the canvas that might be the simplest easiest way I've ever found of making some very gentle little clouds hey I just come down here and just just sort of blend out the base a little bit just a tiny bit there knock off the excess paint and very lightly very lightly just blend it see don't over blend to your cloud will go away and leave you he'll leave you stranded all by yourself there that's all you need okay today let's build us a nice Mountain shoot let's take we use some black we have a little touch of Prussian blue Van Dyck Brown put some crimson in there to shoot that's a nice color there we are pull it out very flat go straight down cut across see how that little roll of paint lives right out there on the end of the knife key let's go right up in here watch right here take the knife very firmly push in just basic shapes push it very firmly you want to try to push that paint right into the fabric maybe over here lives a little peek comes out this is your Mountain so you make it however you want it hello there we go maybe comes out to here oh there's another little bump see you're limited only by your imagination only by your imagination we have no boundaries here total freedom now I'm going to take the large brush I'm going to grab that because of canvases wet you can move the color let's move it there grab it pull firmly that way automatically it becomes lighter toward the base the bottom of the mountain should be lighter in the top that way it comes out looking like all the beautiful miss that lives down there there just let that go right on off into the distance we don't know where that goes don't you but already see that mountain looks like it's just sort of floating there that's what we're looking for clean my brush there we are okay today let's use the little small knife I don't take some white white white white some dark sienna we're just going to mix those two together we'll mix several different areas so I have look here see right there is quite light over here it's dark so that way I'll be able to what to take from each side and have a difference okay cut off our little roll of paint got a small roll of paper now then let's go up in here I like this small knife for getting in here doing these little delicate things let's just begin putting all kinds of little things out here there there they are okay maybe right in here there comes one where be why wherever you think it should be that's where it should be got us right on down let's begin working with some shadows here I'll take some white Prussian blue some Van Dyck Brown I'm looking for a bluish bluish gray color put some black in there too what the heck there that's nice that's nice okay once again we cut off our little roll of paint now then let's go right in here and let's begin putting in the indication those little shadows little shadows that live we back here want these to be quite subdued there they are see they just live right in there have a good time maybe over here yeah you're right their lives some nice little shadows there right down soon you just make all kinds of son of a guns in there just by just by pulling down or for that knife I like his little knife or this it really really works quite well now you can go back to some your dark and maybe here and there you just want to put the indication of some nice deep shadows so you can just play light against dark dark against light go back and forth forwards and backwards okay now we'll come right down here maybe yep look at that see there's just all kinds of things happening in here just sort of let him happen maybe this comes around down soon maybe they come together there we don't know however you want them however you want that's the way they can be and here in there we have some dark areas and get carried away here and just keep going and going tell you hon maybe over here maybe you see that comes right down in the front right down in the front maybe we'll even have these come together you can bring them right together just like that a bit of a dark color will put a deep shadow in there look at that that don't son of a guns just sort of work right in there just work it back and forth forth and back take a little touch of phthalo blue and white just want to put a little indication maybe of a little something that lives right in there hmm that's nice that's nice right all down just intermingle some shadows here and there I want some shadow over here too for I forget it soon let it go no pressure and I absolutely no pressure the most gentle touch imaginable there but you can make some fantastic mountains that easy ok let's take let's take our big brush now very lightly I just want to begin tapping this just want to tap the base of it want to create the illusion of mist very lightly there we go and here maybe we'll just give it a little pull that'll soften it and bring it all together it looks like a nice little rocky place now maybe where the mountain goat sleeps there over here so all of these angles maybe this works its way right on over wherever you want it pick up a little touch of color right there so you can bring that right now then let's have some fun I'm gonna go right right into a little bit of a yellow that a yellow reach up here get a little touching the SAP green let's just bring them together maybe a little yellow ochre in there like yeah that's pretty pretty pretty okay now then let's let's say maybe back here there's some little Hills new grassy hills at climb right at the side of this mountain see him see they live right there you knew that there we are but just follow the angles in your mountain and you can creat all kinds of beautiful little thing away a little dark Sienna here and there to that yellow ochre and CAD yellow dark in that color just a little bit so it shows up better there we go I get it climb that mountain sometimes a little bit of dark color dropped in just sort of play back and forth between darks and lights and look at the look at the basic shapes in here and here we said this was sort of working around like it so that's the way this should work a little bit climbing right up through there just just bend those trees right around my cat comes right on down but you can create all kinds of beautiful effects so easy over in here all of these tangles most important a little bit of dark here and there this is our shadow side of the mountain so we want it to be a little darker overall just layer after layer all kinds of things there now you need a two inch brush and you're in business see that mountain already is sitting right out there and all those little green hills okay now then we can take a clean brush if you want to create in more mystique all right down here at the base with a clean brush and just tap it just half the edges over and that will create even more mist always following the angles and very lightly very lightly just barely barely barely touching the canvas can blend all that together now maybe how does the hang on the same well brush we're going to a little bit of this same dark color we made the mountain out of what the heck this one is a good dark color maybe there's a little foothill that lives right there you want this darker as things get closer to getting the landscape as you get darker and darker darker darker and darker there we go let this run right on off here somewhere we don't over it goes that puts another plane into the painting adds more dimension makes your painting look deeper there now you can grab it and gently lift up it a little bit it'll make it look like a little distant trees that are far far away far away there look at all the little rascals now while we have that color let's take a little dead color and pull straight down underneath put them have water then we need a little reflection back here flee this a little reflection there just pull it down straight down okay now very lightly come across soon got to make all those little noises - it didn't work there we are see and we have instant reflections now we can take our knife a little bit of a little bit of liquid white okay pull it out very flat then we just sort of do like yet get a little bit on the bottom of the knife this time sometimes we load it on top sometimes on the bottom depending on the effect we're looking for I want to push very firmly and then the knife only make like a little bit of a little bit of land not sandbar something is projecting out here it's far away so it's very hard to see detail very very hard okay clean off no all night let's have some fun shoot just mix up a big pile of color here we're gonna have black Prussian blue brown crimson little set green whatever you get long as it's good and dark Mazal mix up the pretty good pile we're going to we're going to use a lot find a fan brush there's one let's go right into that pile of dark color loaded full of paint a lot of paint maybe over here we have the indication of some little evergreens that live over here there they are and all I'm doing is tapping straight down see there you can see super so we're doing just tapping down right down we're down were down were down were down the tower that's all there it goes and we let it get smaller smaller as it goes out here we'll have a little Peninsula land that lives right out here there there we go we just fell all that into some nice dark color boy I think I made a mess any couple minutes here okay tell you what maybe a couple of these trees maybe they had a little more sunlight a little more water whatever they got strong a big and they stand out or maybe they just hold bigger there yes yes maybe that one right there just pick them out so you can see little evergreen lives right there and we contain Ludlum's in the water upside down look at that sneaky huh just another one yeah now then find a big brush be sure it's dry decide where you want reflections because the canvas is wet you can grab a bit of paint and just move it look at that now then very lightly come across and keep these brush strokes as straight as possible they just won't look right if they're crooked your water looks like it's going to run sort of yaha that's a new word I made up then we'll take some yellow yellow yellow yellow reach up here get some SAP green some of that dark color here will not dart cut or load the brush full get a little yellow ochre in there and elaine.dean yellow - what the heck a lot of color and then back in here I want to put the indication just push up with a brush indication of some happy little grassy things that live back here in this peninsula there see there they come there they come just push up right and it makes all those little grassy things just happen looks like a lot of those bushes and things that are far away far far away yeah I'll take our knife a little bit of Van Dyck Brown will pull that paint out and very flat and once again cut across to get our little rule of paint right out on the edge of the knife then come in here and put us on some land areas there take a little bit of our brown and white this is what was left over from the mountain what the heck we're just using put a few highlights here and there there a little touch of our liquid white put us a little waterline into here that cleans up the bottom x2 separate there just what it makes it a little more pleasant there we go maybe a little ripple in the water whatever we we don't want this side over here left out so let's put some let's put some trees here back with fan brush a lot of color in the brush a lot of color maybe there's a big tree who lives boom right there now just the corner of the brush you can see this one good just the corner of the brush working back and forth think about a tree think about a tree just like so so to think about what it is you you're trying to do try to imagine that your tree out how would you want to look out here everyone I was a kid I one day I wanted to catch a rabbit one time I Tonko tell me the way to catch a rabbit was hide behind the henhouse make a noise like a carrot when he came around grab I haven't quite figured that out yet okay there's another one like so there okay see there I just have another tree there just makes funny little noises with fan brush it goes pittypat pittypat may me have another one here in your world you decide how many for how few trees you want drop them in your opinion I like leaving areas like this open see you can see back behind that tree now I would treasure that little spot don't lose him don't lose him let's give them a baby tree right here little tiny tree you grow up one day though here you grow up and I'll put one more right there just to fill up this spot there he goes man kids put a lot of color in there let's put some trunks and our trees will use white dark sienna over that flat try to cross our little roll of paint again and just here and there we'll just touch give it a little pull as it gets bigger there see just indication we're not looking for a lot of detail you wouldn't see the entire trunk because it's going to be it's going to be leaves on the front here and there there we go over here we leave but the indication a little dude right there and then back to our little fan brush it has the green on it I want this to be very dark a lot of color okay now there let's go in here and we'll just put some nice green highlights on these trees just wherever wherever you want there I like to keep these dark though because I love the contrast that evergreens give your paintings all right but that's a personal choice I think all of painting is a personal choice there we go you know this series draws

fill this in you could do this with a paint roller just put in some color take my large brush tap in a little green check it out see there that easy we'll just put some nice little soft grassy areas down at the bottom of this tree there but that easy you can create a very nice painting and the old clock on the wall tells me it's about time to go for the day and once again I want to thank you very
