- Hello, I'm Bob Ross, and I'd like to welcome you to the 25th Joy of Painting series. If this is your first time with us, allow me to extend a personal invitation for you to drag out your
brushes and your paints, and to paint along with us each show. And if you've been with us before, please allow me to thank
you for inviting us back for another series of painting shows. So I'll tell ya what, let's start out today and have 'em run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint
along with us at home. While they're doing that, lemme show ya what I've got going up here. This is a wet on wet painting technique, so normally the first thing
we do is cover the canvas with one of our mediums. Today, I've used Liquid White, and the Liquid White is designed only to make the canvas wet and slick. It allows us to actually blend color right here on the canvas, rather than workin' ourself
to death on the palette. So, with that, tell ya what, let's get started and just
have a good time today. I thought today is such
a fantastic day here, that we'll just do a painting
that's very bright and happy, and I think you'll enjoy it. So, let's start with a little bit, tiniest little amount of the Cad Yellow, just a very, very small amount. Let's go right up here. Once again, the canvas is
covered with liquid white, so this color will blend right on there. Just like so. And I'm just using little
criss-cross strokes, little X's, and we'll just sort of
work it across like that. There, maybe just a touch more color. And we'll put a little bit right in here, I think we'll have some
water in this painting, so let's have all these colors just reflect right into the water. There. Just Cadmium Yellow. Now, then, without cleaning the brush, I'mma go into a small
amount of the Bright Red, very small amount, it's a very strong color, but we only need a little bit. Okay, let's go back up here, and then with that, we'll just put a little
pinkish glow in the sky. There. As I say, I thought today we'd make something that's just bright and shiny and beautiful and it just makes you feel good. But when you're painting your painting, you do it in any color
combination that you want. All we wanna do here is show you how to make some of these
fantastic effects very simply. There we go. I might put just a
little bit more in there. Okay. Good. And while we have that on the old brush, let's put a little bit down in here. So it'll allow a little of that color to reflect right into the water, that easy. Okay, That worked out pretty good, shoot, let's keep goin' here, I'mma take a little
bit of the Phthalo Blue and a little Alizarin Crimson. We'll just mix those right on the brush, hoot, and make it easy. There's a little crimson,
a little Phthalo Blue. Let's go back up here. And with that, ooh, that's a nice color, sort of a lavender. We'll just still use a
little criss-cross strokes, we'll just lay in of that color. And while I have it on the brush, I'mma go down to the bottom and do the same basic thing down here. Whatever we do on top, we'll do the same basic
thing on the bottom. Alright. And let's finish this guy off with a little bit of Prussian Blue. Now, Prussian Blue is much stronger, it's a very dark blue, a beautiful color. We'll add just a little bit
of that right on the brush, and let's go up in here, and we just fill the sky up. There we go. Already, already we have a masterpiece for the Museum of Modern Art right here. (soft chuckle) There we go. There we go. Little bit more of that color, and we'll just add it once again, right down to the bottom, and that's all there is to it. Okay. Down at the bottom, I'mma put a little bit of
black right at the corners, I want it to be a little darker. A little darker, so at each corner, I'll add just a little
bit of the Midnight Black. Now then, the most fun part of the
whole painting technique is washing the brush. (chuckles) So, let's wash the brush. We do that with odorless paint thinner. (thinner sloshes) And I have a screen in
the bottom of this can, so we can scrub the
bristles against the screen and the solid materials
sort of settle to the bottom keeping the paint
thinner relatively clean. Now we shake it off, and then... (brush thwacks) (chuckles) Just beat the devil out of it. As I say, that has to be the most fun
part of the whole technique. Now then, let's just begin blending
these colors together. Because the canvas is wet
with the Liquid White, it allows us to actually
blend these colors together right on the canvas. Very simple. Still using little criss-cross strokes, working from the light area to the dark, 'cause you don't want
to carry that dark color back down here into your light area. 'Kay. (brush thwacks) Now, sometimes you can just
beat the brush like that, and it'll take the excess paint off without going through the
entire cleaning procedure. There. Down here, we'll just
do the same basic thing. 'Mm-kay. Now then, I think I'll wash the
old brush one more time, I just like to wash this brush. As I say, that might
be the most fun of all. I get letters from people
who say they don't paint, they just bought a brush and beat it, 'cause it makes 'em feel better. There. (brush thwacks)
(laughing) And it really does. I'd like to have a bright
area in this painting, so I'mma take a little
bit of Titanium White, just pure Titanium White, and let's just go right up in here and allow that to mix with the Cad Yellow and the Bright Red, and all the beautiful colors we have, and it won't show much now, but when we begin putting things in there, then it'll come alive. There we go. Now we just go across the entire canvas to sort of take out the brush strokes and blend everything together. And we're ready. Shoot, we're ready. Tell ya what let's do. Today, let's build us a little mountain. And for that, I'm wanna take a little
bit of the Midnight Black, little touch of Prussian Blue, get some Van Dyke Brown. Maybe even some Dark
Sienna, what the heck. Alizarin Crimson? Doesn't matter. There we go. Pull this paint out as
flat as you can get it. Take the knife and just cut across, so you get a little roll of paint that lives right up on
the edge of the knife, so you can see it right on the edge there. 'Kay, let's go up here. Now then, you have to make your
first major decision. In your world, where
does your mountain live, and I think it lives right here. Right here. You decide. Wherever you want it. If you've painted with us before, you know that I believe this
piece of canvas is your world, and on this piece of canvas, you can create any illusion that you want, any dream that you want. You can put it right here. All you have to do is just
learn a few little basics, then devote a little time to practice, and just let your imagination go. Really all there is to it. We'll have something about like 'at. We'll grab this old two-inch brush here. I'm gonna take it and pull this. Just pull it. There's not much paint up here. Not much paint. There, see, just pull it, let it blend with with
this nice light color here. Okay, we'll pull this a little
bit over here, whatever way. And that creates a softness down at the base of this mountain. Just happens automatically. Mm-kay. Now we're ready. Tell ya what, today let's take a little Titanium White, and we'll reach up here and
get some Midnight Black, make a nice gray color,
very nice gray color. Maybe I'll even put a
little touch of the, yeah, a little Dark Sienna into it, too, and maybe a little touch of Bright Red. Just sorta let your imagination go wherever you think these colors should go, let 'em go there, alright? Once again, cut across, get our small roll of paint
right on the edge of the knife. Maybe our lights coming
from the left today. So, we'll just take this, and let it just sorta barely graze there. No pressure, no pressure at all. We want these little
mountains to be far away, I don't want 'em to be very bright. They're far away, very
quiet little mountains. There. And maybe right up in
here, see there, though? That's all there is to it. Once again, let your imagination take
you wherever you want to go. There. 'Cause we all see nature
through different eyes, and each one of us will have
a different interpretation of what we see, and that's what makes it wonderful. Painting is a very individual
thing, very individual. There we go. And maybe, shoot, who knows, maybe it comes right on
over in here, we don't know. Wherever you want it. And we can go back, and we'll take a little white, a little bit of Prussian Blue, wanna make a little shadow color, and we get a little black. But we have a little blue in there, to give the indication of
a little reflected light. And we'll put a little
Van Dyke in there, too. Swhoo, ooh, like 'at. Don't over-mix the color. Our little roll of paint, as usual. And we come back in here, and just begin putting in a few little indications of some shadows. I don't want a whole lot in here, because I want this to
look like it's far away. Too much detail will
bring it too close to ya. There. Just a little. Just a little. There we go, a little right in there, maybe it comes right on out, wherever you think it should be. That's exactly where it should be. See, we can come back in here, add a little more color. Just let that play right through there. Once again, I want to
keep this very subdued. Now then. Let's take our old two-inch
brush and begin tapping. Just begin tapping. I wanna create the illusion of mist. I'mma grab a clean brush, that one had a little paint on it, and I wanna keep this
as clean as possible, 'cause I'm gonna begin
blending that upward. That's the reason I wasn't too
worried about detail up here. There. See there? Very soft. We'll take a little white,
and begin blending that up. Once again, I wanna create the illusion of
mist in the distance in here. This little mountain lives far, far away. There. Now, very gently, just blend it. Now see that light color we put
in there is showing through, it'll create the illusion of mist at the base of your mountain, and that's what'll make
your painting special. There we go. Alright. That was a lot of fun. (soft laugh) I told ya you'd like this. Let's take a little bit
of little Prussian Blue, a little white, there. Like so, and get a little bit of Alizarin
Crimson and put in there, maybe a little touch more. Ooh, that's nice. That's-a nice, now then. (knife taps) Just somethin' about like that. 'Kay, lemme grab a old fan brush, think I'll use a fan brush today. There we go. Now we just load some color
right into the bristles. Just fill up both sides of 'em like that. That's all there is to it. 'Kay, let's go back up in here. Maybe we have some little foothills, little footy-hills that live right down at the base of this mountain. We just take the fan brush and
just tap downward to do that. Just tap downward. There we go, see there? That's all there is to it. And I'm gonna apply
less and less pressure, so it's not as dark over here. 'Cause this, I want it to look like
it's further away from you. There. And we'll bring it through, let's just bring it right
on across over here, wherever you want it to be. Somethin' about like that. But, all we're doing is
just tapping, just tapping. Now, we'll take a clean two-inch brush, and I want to create the illusion of mist down here at the base. There we go. So we just tapping. As you can probably hear,
I'm tapping very firmly. This is where you take
out any frustrations, hostilities, right here. This is better than
arguing with your spouse. Of course, if you're like
me, you always lose anyway. This is where ya really, really
take out your hostilities. There, now, very lightly,
one hair and some air. Touch and lift upward. See how soft that makes it look? Shoot, I'll tell ya what,
while we have that old color, put a little more on the brush, and let's just pull it straight down. And we'll create the illusion
of an instant reflection. That easy. And as traditional painter, reflections used to drive me crazy, but this is so easy. Just pull it straight down, because the canvas is
wet, you can do this. The paint will move on there. And then, very lightly, go across, just enough to move it a little bit, and it gives it a watery feel. I'd take little bit of the Liquid White and we'll put it on the palette. I'm gonna at the least
little touch of Bright Red to the least little touch, just enough to warm it up. Pull it out very flat and cut across. ' Kay, let's go up in here. And with that, we'll just add us a little
water line right in here. Just a little divider between the trees and the reflections, a little light between the darks. There we go. And little light areas
is what will separate and make everything stand out. Just that little light area. Isn't that neat? This is a very, very
simple little painting, even if you've never painted before, this is one you could do on
your first or second attempt. But when you first start, expect to run into some difficulties, because you have to think about things, and figure out how they work, and how to load the brush, and all kinds of little things like this, but very, very quickly, within a half a dozen paintings, you'll be so comfortable with this, (chuckles) you won't believe
you had any difficulty with it. Tell ya what, show ya a neat will way
to make some nice trees. Let's just take all
this dark color we had, mix some Prussian Blue,
some black, brown, crimson, some Sap Green, a little Sap Green, I tell ya what, let's put you some Phthalo Green, I like the Phthalo Green in trees. There. Probably use more Phthalo
Green in trees sometime than I do Sap Green. As long as it's a very bright green, so I usually try to dull it down with some of the other colors. Now then, I've got a brush here that's dirty, it's got a little white on it, and I'm goin' to go into this color. The reason I have that white on there is because I don't want
this to be real dark, I don't want it to be black-looking. 'Kay, I'mma bring this
brush to a nice chisel edge. Pull it through the paint, wiggle it. Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle like 'at, and then sharpen it, just
like you would a fine knife. Here, you can see how sharp that is. 'Kay, let's go up in here. Now, maybe in our world back in here, there live some big trees. Now, there's a lot of ways to make trees, here's one of the simplest. Touch the canvas, give it a little push. Just give it a little push. Isn't that easy? That's one side of the tree, come back, and we'll put the indication
of the other side. And he's got a big brother
that lives right there. See when you're painting, when you paint, make up little stories about
what's happening in your world. You're friends and your relatives may look at you like
you're a little strange, but that's okay, painters are expected to
be a little different. But make up little stories, it will really help you in
deciding what you're gonna paint, it'll give you ideas of things to paint. That may be the hardest thing in painting, is not how to paint, but what to paint. And I use this continually
to come up with new ideas. In my mind, this scene may be, oh, it may be way out
in the woods somewhere, and there was an old trapper that lived out here for many years, and this is what he saw every
morning when he woke up. There, and somebody's gonna say,
"Well, where's the old trapper?" Well, maybe he had a bad day
and he fell in the river, or maybe he moved back to the city, or wherever you want him to be. There we go. Isn't that a simple, easy way to make the indication
of a lot of little trees? Anybody can do this. There. And oils are so forgiving. So forgiving. You could make a million
mistakes with oils and change 'em very simply. With other mediums, that's very difficult. And oils, to me, have a luster that no other
medium has ever achieved. There we go. Now, that'll give us a few
little background trees, just livin' way back in there. Somethin' like so. Now then we'll take, ♫ I'm gonna take ♫ the old fan brush again, lemme grab a fan brush. And I wanna put some trees
that are a little closer to us, so I'mma go right into the dark color. This has no white in it, it's very dark. 'Kay, let's go back up in here. Now then, here and there, and there and here, I'm gonna add just the indication of a few little evergreens. These are closer to us, so
they're a little darker. This is what will help create the illusion of distance in the painting. There, why don't we just throw
in a few real quick here. And you put in, when you're doin' your painting, as many or as few as you want, it's up to you. Once again, I don't want to just teach people to copy when we're doing this, I wanna teach people
the freedom of painting, the joy of painting, and the joy comes from
doing your own thing, here. Alright, let's move right over in here and put a couple little ones in here. I don't want to cover up all those nice distant ones we've put in. Alright. There they go. (chuckles) D'you ever believe you could paint a whole forest that quick? You can. You can, I know you can. There. There we go. 'Kay, we just put one more
right here, what the heck. Now then, we just take
that same old brush, and I'm gonna go right
into a little Cad Yellow, and that'll give us an instant green. In here and there, and there and here. We'll just put the indication
of a little highlight. I don't want a whole lot. A little bit of the Yellow Ochre
and the Indian Yellow, too, just to change the flavor. There. Wanna keep this pretty dark, though. There we go. Ya see how simple the light is? These little evergreen trees, they live right in your fan brush. All ya gotta do is, sorta scare 'em out. Now then, let's take some of that same old color, and let's put us a little reflection that lives right underneath that. Just pull that same color straight down, just straight down. And then go gently across,
just like we did before. And that'll give us the
illusion of instant reflections. While I got that old brush goin', maybe there's a few
little bushes and trees that live right along the waterline here. We'll put in some dark, and that'll be our background color. Okay. Now then, I'mma take a little
bit of the Liquid White, put it on the brush, we'll go right through a
little bit of the Cad Yellow, Sap Green be right back,
a little Sap Green, Yellow Ochre, Indian Yellow. Now and then, I'll touch the Bright Red, because Bright Red is a duller. And we load a lot of color in the brush, looky there, a lot of color. Let's go up here. Now with that, giving a gentle push,
pushing upward, see there? We can create all kinds of
gorgeous little trees and bushes and happy little things that
live all along the water here. That easy, that easy. Maybe there's a bigger
tree lives right here. There he is. 'Kay, we'll give him a little friend. A little touch of the bright red there. Swhoo, ooh, that's a sparkler. Shoot, let's reflect him
right down here in the water. Maybe, maybe, yup, you're right, another one lives right there. Just wherever you think they should be, really let your imagination take ya to places that you see only in your mind. (brush taps softly) And you can do that in painting. You can do anything that
you believe you can do. All you gotta do is practice a little. There. See? We're just gonna reflect a few
of those nice little things down in the water, while we got the old brush dirty. Maybe there's a little, hmph, yep, little bush lives right there. Alright. Now then. (brush thwacks) Two inch brush, and this is your test for delicacy. Touch, barely touch, just graze it. Pull it downward like so. And then, go gently,
gently, gently across, just enough to, sorta,
disturb it a little bit. But that makes those gorgeous mirror reflections in there. Let's take a little Van Dyke Brown, let's put a little dirt here. (chuckles) Need somethin'
for it to sit on. We don't want our tree
to fall off in the water and make a big splash. Just somethin' about like so. And white, a little bit of Dark Sienna, little Van Dyke Brown, mix it together. And let's just come right along in here, and put a little highlight here and there, just like so. Just like so. Back to our Liquid White. We'll put a little water line in there. There we are. Once again, this little waterline will separate your land from your water. There, somethin' about like so. Where ever you think it should be, a few little ripples here and there, maybe the wind's just
gently caressing this. Take the knife, put in a
few little sticks and twigs, all those little things that
live way back in the woods. There, just a few little bushes that
come down on the land area. Alright. Let's have some fun. If you've painted with me before, you know I like big trees, so let's take some of this dark color that we had on the old, we'll use the old two-inch brush here. 'Kay, let's go right up in here. Maybe, in our world lives a big tree that goes right off the canvas. (laughing) As I say, if you've
painted with me before, you know I like these big trees. Now, in your world, when you paint yours, if you don't want a big tree here, just leave it out. The painting will still be gorgeous. But it's a nice, nice way to
practice some of these things. Just drop 'em in. There. And you could do this with a fan brush, a one-inch brush, or, as we're doin' it here, with the old two-inch brush. I like the old two-inch
brush, it's a lot of fun. Should probably get that goin'. Maybe there's a nice little
bush that lives right there. And we just, we're just filling this
up with dark color. In order to have light, you
first have to have dark. You have to have a dark down here, so your light shows, otherwise you put dark against dark, you have nothing. Light against light, you have nothing. I just took that same old dirty brush, went right into the
yellows, all the yellows. Gonna tap a little color in here. And let's go up in here, and just put the indication of some beautiful little
highlights that live out here. There, don't kill all your darks. This gets working good, and it gets nice, and ya just have a tendency sometime to sorta kill all the darks. Leave some in there, it shows depth and shadows in your tree. A little place for all the
little birds to hide, (chuckes) and you know me, I'm crazy about the little animals that live out here in these woods. There. Mm-kay, back to our one-inch bush, I'mma dip it in the Liquid White. Now, the Liquid White's there only, only to make the paint thinner. One of our golden rules
is that a thin paint will stick to a thick paint. The paint we use is very thick, very dry. It's much, much thicker
than traditional oil paints. Without that, you'd have a difficult time making these layers of
paint stick without, well, if you've painted, you know, without becoming a mud mixer. (chuckles) And if you've painted, you have discovered a little
bit of mud mixing in your life, that happens. All of us who have painted
have a little bit of that. There we go. Okay. Maybe there's another little
bush lives right here. Just wherever you think it should be. And we can take a little Van Dyke Brown, maybe there's a little
path (whistles softly) just goes right in there, like so. Take a little brown and white
and just (whistles softly) There. That easy. And we need some bushes on this side, to sort of push that path
down into the painting. There. See there? Somethin' about like that. And we'll just put in some
few little bushes and trees. Take the old knife, scrape in some sticks and twigs, and shoot, that's about all ya need. Alright. Well, I think we'll
call that one finished. Hope you've enjoyed it. Give this one a try,
cause it'll work for you. Until next time, I'd like to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (pleasant music)
