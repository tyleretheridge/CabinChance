hi welcome back I'm glad you could join me today today I have a special friend with me here that I want to I want to show him to you this is my little friend hoot and hoots a little baby owl and he is a character and as you can see hooting I have the same hairdresser what son of agains got a hair it looks just like mine and he's just oh he's about two weeks old now and this is his first time in front of a camera so he's a little nervous but I buried him from the bird lady so I could show you that's Diane Schaefer she lives here in Muncie and she takes care of all these little characters when they get hurt this one was orphaned as I say he's about two weeks old hey isn't he something though beautiful little bird yeah yeah you go to talk a little bit okay I think we have to go to work now I'll tell you what let's have him run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me today I'll set him down I'll be right back with you so we'll just set him right over here there we go he still squawking grab the old pallet as you can see today we have a canvas up here that's I've taken black gesso and I've sort of painted a basic shape in here and on top of the black gesso now we've allowed that to completely dry and then we've taken and put transparent color over here and that's the mixture of we put some Van Dyke Brown a little bit of phthalo blue and phthalo green and I just covered it in this spot right in here I've just put liquid white and everything is wet and it's ready to go so let's go tell you what let's start out today with an old two-inch brush I'm gonna go and pick up the least little touch of the CAD yellow just least little touch there we go okay now right here at the horizon I want to put a nice bright little area right there that easy maybe a little touch over here okay now then without cleaning the brush I'm gonna go right back over and pick up a small small amount of yellow ochre just a little yellow ochre okay now this right above that and lying it to blend together we'll put that ochre mm it's pretty already okay once again without cleaning the brush I'm going to go right into bright red so we started with CAD yellow went into yellow ochre and now we're into bright red and just tap a little into the bristles just tap it and then gets a nice even distribution of color all the way through the bristles okay now then with the red we can go right in here we're just using sort of little crisscross strokes just apply a little bit because you had the yellow when you brush this is going to turn a beautiful orange color there if we just blend it right on down into the yellow ochre just let it sort of disappear that's pretty already I like these colors now then once again without cleaning the brush this is one of those paintings I like because you don't clean the brush a lot I'm lazy I want to write it to phthalo blue just a small amount of blue and once again tap the bristles okay let's go back up here up in here we'll put the blue there we go little darker I just let it blend right down to the rib okay now we can wash your brush wash your brush that's a fun part of all this shake it off cover everything in the studio now with a nice clean dry brush you can go back in here and just blend all this together so you can't tell where one color stops and the next color starts just like so okay and that gives us a beautiful little sky and it's very very simple now then I'm put a little black on the brush and then I'm going into yellow I put the black on the brush only to make this turn green when I touch it a little tiny bit of the midnight black I'm going to go and tap some color into it let's go right back up here maybe there's a little Hill we back here in the distance so all we do is just tap just tap all you're doing is touching the canvas with a brush canvas will pull off what it wants give you back what's left just like the tax man he takes all what he wants gives you what's left usually there's not much left there all you're doing is just tapping gently gently tapping if you want to show maybe another plane in here you start with fresh color and leave a little dark area between them and you can create the illusion of another plane they're that easy and you can make as many or as few as you want in your world hope you enjoy seeing the little creatures I like I like to show you the little birds and stuff we have some birds that are grown and I I can't show those goes head they're sort of hard to control a little owl he's a character it's one of the most beautiful little birds okay well we have little brush going tell you what we just take maybe we'll just tap the corner here into a little bit of paint we'll get a little yellow ocher little indian yellow just the corner of it just that corner okay let's go back up here maybe right along here lives a happy little tree I'm just going to take the corner that brush and just begin creating the basic shape of little tree there and just a little touch of the bright red there make a rascal stand out and sing say all you need is a big old two inch brush little imagination some practice you can paint fantastic paintings beautiful little paintings look at there this Bush lives right there just sort of make up a scene in your mind drop it on the canvas so what's so nice about this style of painting you can you can put an idea on canvas before it escapes when I was traditional painter I'd get an idea in my mind and shooted by the time I got around to painting it and spending a week or two working on it the vision in my mind had totally changed here you can do it while it's fresh there all right see now we've created a whole nother plane right here just by doing that just by doing that maybe tell you what to tell you what it helps to be a little crazy when you do this and think up little think about little stories and make up little things here in my mind I think this is a beautiful place back here to maybe have a little cabin that lives way back over in there so for that let's take some Van Dyke Brown pull it out very flat we take the old knife cut across so we have a little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife there you can see it good now maybe our little cabin maybe it lives maybe it lives right there we'll paint the back Eve first just like so paint the other side of the roof mmm there where see how easy that is if you don't make those little noises oh it won't work for you kind of make those little noises doop there one right down here and that is a nice way of blocking in your basic shape for your little cabin and you're not committed yet you could still change that little rascal any way that you want to maybe it's got a roof on it that's a use of brown and white little bit of black in there what makes sort of a dirty gray color just leave your color marble like that we don't want to over mix it once again our little roll of paint it's most important how you load this knife now then just touch and get nervous here let it go OOP OOP OOP OOP OOP OOP OOP OOP OOP OOP see there and it makes beautiful little shapes on your house then you just let it just bounce right along through there looks like little shingles you can see far off in there maybe a little bit out here on the other side you'd see a little touch there now they don't get the small knife that small knife is fantastic for sneaking into little places we'll take some dark sienna a little white mix them together but not over mix them maybe we'll put a touch of Van Dyke Brown there too whoo I like that that's nicely you get beautiful colors happening right there and when you pick up that little roll of paint those same colors are right they're not roll of paint now then touch and just pull it down barely barely grazing barely grazing look at that see and that simple you can paint the front of your little house your little cabin now for the side over here not as much light I'll hit that so we'll add some more Van Dyck Brown will make it darker cut off a roll of paint same way and and and look right there we'll put a little bit on the side and see there you can do that it's easy we make painting easy we show you how to do it the only thing you have to add is imagination there we are make it look like are some little boards in there mmm kitty now we need a door let's put a door we take straight Van Dyck Brown you this little door right there just come across with some brown see you can make your doors big or as small as you want it can take a little touch of the white that'll just sort of highlight the edges of it so you can see it there right around like so shoot maybe there's a little window in there who knows would take a little blue little touch of blue least little touch it white it little we use a small edge of the knife maybe OOP there that's enough to give the indication that there's a little window in there sometimes maybe we just will make this edge stand out a little song add a little light color right along this edge so it'll stand out there you can see it better now then we want to fix the bottom of this cabin so we can do a cabin ectomy there you go cabin ectomy just cut it off and you have a nice little cabin right there they have them let's take a little brown little crimson then we'll go into our yellow only put those colors on there so when they touch the yellow you get all these different shades don't want just straight yellow and a lot of things happening little SAP green too little Indian yellow yellow ocher a tap give the brush a little push see how that brushing a little Ridge of paint right out there that's what you're painting with now then let's come back in here and just begin barely touching and we can add all these layers of little grassy things that are happening there over here on the other side the cabin maybe this comes down like so okay tell you why we need a way to get to this little cabinet yeah let's take some Van Dyck Brown go right in here just begin pushing that like so and we want to make this path get larger large it's hard to see right now against the black and it'll show up there yeah we'll have it coming right on around maybe down in here somewhere hmm okay as I said this Brown it probably won't show up a great deal against the black background but when we begin putting highlights in there it'll come alive so let's begin working on some little bushes and stuff at our back here we just go back to the old two-inch brushing just going to tap a little color right into the corner of it here again that's a nice easy way to make some beautiful little tree in bush shapes maybe right back in here there lives a nice little bush right there see there he is you know he was there you knew he was there look at that and that sort of just pushes that cabin right back into the distance there we go now let's begin working on maybe some of these trees here that are on the on the sides so for that use the liner brush and I'll go into will just use this color right here that's a nice color I was just brown and white we want that paint to be very thin very thin let me get a little more paint thinner here we want to be sure it's a real thin like ink turn the bristles in there all right now maybe right up in here maybe there lives a nice tree trunk right there turn that brush let it wiggle and jiggle and all kinds of things happen as it works its way down there just keep turning it it makes very interesting tree trunks and you can come back in here and drop in the indication of some little limbs and branches and sticks and need a place for a little owl to sit there why son of a guns got some talons on him he'll get you there you have to have to be very careful with it be respectable because he didn't realize how strong he is even just a two week old baby out boy he's a signer I got maybe over here see there is another tree maybe he's got a friend right here and in your painting you put as many or as few trunks as you want just sort of look around and and each one will be different look at your painting because it's not going to be exactly the same as mine the only thing we try to do here is show you how to how to make effects how to create certain illusions and then you do with it whatever you want we each see nature through different eyes so you paint the way you see it and then it's right and it's right the only rule that I respect in art is if it makes you happy then it's good you do what makes you happy you paint scenes the way you see them and that's when you really really experience the joy of painting there now we have all kinds of little tree trunks and things happening in there all I got that going maybe back in these little bushes here you can make out the indication of some little things that are projecting up there's one and once again you decide how many of these live in your world and drop them in okay tell you what let's do let's grab an old one-inch brush here and we'll begin putting some foliage in here going to go up here grab a little touch of the black and go into the green or the yellow the little make green yellow ocher now tap the bristles into the paint just tap them that loads a small amount of paint right out on the tip so you can see it being pushed up right there right there that's what you're after okay now then begin thinking about shape and form and all you have to do is just barely touch the canvas and begin laying in all kinds of beautiful little things like maybe I'll make it a little bit brighter so you can see it a little better on TV there but now when you're painting your picture at home you paint it any way that you wanted if you have trouble making your paint stick at a small amount of the liquid white or a little bit of paint thinner to your brush there we go but once again the most important thing here is worrying about shape all the little individual things that happen in here there we are hmm this is one of the nicest easiest ways of ever developed of making beautiful beautiful little trees and even if you've never painted before you can do this you can do it it works we give you everything you need here all you need is just a little practice and a little imagination and off you go they're just layer after layer and don't be in too big a hurry just work in one section of your tree at a time I have to be in a hurry here if I don't get done in time Lee I have no sense of humor why they'll get me put it home just take your time think about one clump of leaves one group one individual one friend there and just layer after layer all these beautiful things live deep in the woods and in the trees see somes in the back somes in the foreground anywhere you want there we go once again if you have trouble making the paint stick and the least little touch of paint thinner or liquid white on either one the liquid white of course will make your pain a little brighter so if you don't want it to get any brighter then add nothing but paint thinner there right in there okay little baby when lives there too now let's go on the other side here this big old tree that's hanging out over here we'll give him some nice highlights there see still working in clumps or groups that's what makes that son of guns stand out and save some of these dark areas in between that's what gives you tree depth the tree starts looking flat chances are you've killed all those beautiful dark areas and you can go back and put them in because we don't make mistakes we just have happy accidents learn to work with anything it happens anything it happens okay maybe since we have that area we'll just put some leaves right out here some nice highlights look at that cherry think you could take a big old one-inch brush and make just thousands of beautiful little individual looking leaves that easy you really can really can there we go okay shoot I brush is too slow let's get serious here get the old 2 inch brush it does the same thing only faster will tap a little color into it same ol way now that let's begin creating the lay of the land just begin deciding where this goes as it goes away back into the shadow area back in here use less and less pressure let it just sort of disappear darker darker darker back in here this is where creature hides back in here ask with a little bunny rabbit lives it's quiet and dark there we go okay just varying the colors a little bumps and hills in your land all kinds of happy little things in here but start at the area this father's to way and work continually forward forward forward and that helps create that a illusion of depth the illusion of distance in your painting and to me that's extremely important in a painting that it has depth and distance and many many different planes in it there we go see but this the curvature that you putting put in here once again that creates the lay of the land the way the land flows the direction of the lamb whatever you want to call it all means the same thing and the more you tap this the softer it'll become it just gets thick it'll look like velvet if you work it enough just like velvet I'm going to add the least little touch of liquid white just wanna then that paint a little tiny bit more a little bit of liquid white there we go see that sticks easier any time you have problems making the stick just try adding a little bit of liquid white or paint thinner there we're just layer after layer after layer this is a very simple little painting if you've never if you've never painted before this is a nice one to start with because it's very easy and it works well okay add another little little hill right there let's go over the other side and have some fun over there too she we don't want this side to have it all we'll use a little more of the SAP green just tap that right in there little little brush happen now then I have to make a big decision maybe maybe comes right down here you just push that little cabin as far back as you want you could come way up in here if you wanted to and look like it's behind the hill there we are maybe this one comes from way over here somewhere it just drops down and maybe maybe maybe you want to create maybe this is efficient a more severe drop maybe it drops off faster than the other side and you can do that just by changing the angle make up little stories in your mind once again and just work from that there and you can turn this so it comes toward you look like all those little grassy and things and little ferns that are hanging over just layer after layer I've probably painted 20,000 paintings and I still get excited when I see this work so fantastic every day I get letters from people all over the country who have never picked up a paintbrush in their life and they tried this and it works and they've experienced a whole new world a whole new world and it makes people happy and the people you share it with it brings brings a lot of joy to them it's the reason we call this a joy of painting there I hit a little touch of the bright red that time but see how this is hanging over it's unbelievable you can change these angles and create all types of illusions kitting now and let me find an old fan brush here we put that Van Dyck Brown in here and we didn't show up much now watch what happens I'll just take a little bit of titanium white on the fan brush just a little now we go back up here and we just barely touch barely touch see now that Brown begins to show and we can clean up the bottom of all these little grassy areas bring it all back together and you can make this as light and bright as you want it just by adding more white you can add a little white with some dark Sienna in it that's very pretty ever just sort of experiment a little the fun in painting is the experimenting learning new things every day if you paint for a million years the next painting is going to be your masterpiece you'll always see something in your painting that you can approve and I get letters from people all the time and they said I did a painting and I'm not satisfied with it that's fantastic because that makes you want to go do another painting you see what would make it better I hope you're plagued with dissatisfaction your entire life that way you'll get better and better and better now maybe maybe here and there you can even see the indication little brown and there's too bright that way or a little stone lives right up here climbed right up the side like heaven you can just put anything in here that you want okay shoot I think we'd better have a finish paint either I won't take a little bit of the bright red with paint thinner and when you go to Sandy's I get a lot of questions about how do I sign it look how thin this paint is I mean it's literally it'll run you can see it dripping right off the palate then like ink turn the bristles in there and let's go right up here and we'll sign this one hope you've enjoyed is a fantastic little painting it'll teach you a great deal try it let me know how it works for you that one's signed I think we're going to call this painting finished and on behalf of my little friend hoot that I showed you the beginning of the show I want to wish you happy painting god bless I look forward to seeing you again you
