hello I'm Bob Rios and I'd like to welcome you to the 17th joy of painting series first of all let me thank you for inviting me back for another series of painting shows it's very special to me to be here with you and if this is your first time with us allow me to extend a personal invitation we drag out your brushes and your oil paints and spend a relaxing half-hour with us as we enjoy some of nature's masterpieces so tell you what on this series we're going to use some unorthodox brushes great big old Rascals about a dozen colors and I'm going to show you some of the most fantastic things you've ever seen in the way of painting so come on up here let me tell you what I've got started for today today I thought we'd start this series with an oval so I've taken a piece of contact paper and just cut a little oval out of it and then we've covered this part of the canvas with a thin even coat of liquid white and the liquid white is on here just to make the canvas wet and slick what we do here is a wet on wet technique so the first thing that we need to do is to make the canvas wet and that's all that liquid white is for so we have it covered the biggest mistake made is applying too much liquid white so just put a thin even coat and I thought today it's such a fantastic day we just do a beautiful little painting that's nice and warm soft and I think you'll enjoy it let's start with the old big brush here this is a two-inch brush we'll use a little bit of the yellow ochre I'll be right back and reach up here get a touch of dark Sienna so we have yellow ochre and dark see I'll just mix it right on the brush shoot I'll use working too hard okay let's go up here now maybe maybe today we'll have just a beautiful warm little scene with some trees and maybe a little Sun so let's let's just start up here just making little crisscross strokes and begin placing in some color dark sienna and yellow ochre that's all we're using at this point now then just like so I'm going right back and get a little touch more of that yellow ocher I want this Center here to be a little bit brighter a little bit shinier so we'll just put a little yellow ochre right in here and let it blend outward outward outward just like so there we go and we're gonna run in all the colors across the screen that you so you know exactly what we're using and if you're going to paint along with us that way you can have your palette all set up and ready to go now maybe without cleaning the brush I'll add just the least little touch of alizarin crimson we don't want much just a very small amount and just tap it into the bristles that helps assure a nice even distribution of color all the way through the brush then maybe right up in here we'll just let a little bit of that shine through it's a very warm beautiful painting there hmm that's nice already there we go didn't write on the round now then maybe if you painted with me before you know I'm an absolute fanatic for water I love water I think it's so beautiful so let's have a little water take a little touch of CAD yellow cadmium yellow just the least little amount and mix it I want this to be a little brighter and if this is gonna be our Sun area right here we'll have the Sun just gonna pull down a little streak of color this is a very simple little painting yellow ochre even if you've never painted before this one you can do this one you can do without any problem a little dark sienna and we'll just pull that straight down there we are okay little dark sand on this side so basically we have light in the center and it's getting darker toward the edges maybe you want to make this light airy a little stronger so you take a little titanium white decide where your lightest area is going to be and pull it straight down now very lightly we're just going to go across this whole thing so there is to it okay yeah we said who's gonna have a little Sun in this painting so we will do that now we can use we'll just use our finger today the sad way the Sun is going to be maybe it lives right here right up here and all we do just make a little circle there okay now we can take our knife and very lightly soup sip it off the value still remains in the canvas so now you have to do is just very gently blend that a little and you have an instant Sun and that yellow we put in becomes sort of like a halo around it and it's very very attractive there that's a super effective very easy little sky now let's take a little bit of the dark sienna little dark see and I'll be right back your little yellow ocher little yellow ocher maybe a little bit of that alizarin crimson just to warm it up there we are gonna get a touch more of the yellow ocher oh that's nice let's get enough to eat there and then i'm just going to pull the brush so i look both sides of it both sides of let's go ahead up here maybe there's some nice trees and this is this is probably the simplest easiest way i've ever found of making some very nice little trees take the brush touch and just give a push see there look at there now turn it over give it a little push and do the other side just let the bristles work that easy maybe he has a friend you know me if you've painted with me before I think everybody needs a friend friends are the most valuable things in the world and even the little tree needs a friend there oh say sometimes we avoid this big brush but when right here because it's so large but it'll do fantastic things and do them very easy for you very easy and this is a lazy man's way of painting their baby I have another one right here in your world you decide how many trees live here and all you have to do is just drop them in you need these trees out here so the birds have a place to set there we go maybe maybe maybe yep you're right there is another one and you decide once again painting is as individual as people are so when you're doing a painting you look at it and you decide what makes you happy it makes you happy then it's good then it's good I'm just going to tap the brush right into those same colors just just tap it firmly I'm loading paint right into the corner and let's go right up here same colors now then let's begin putting the indication just tapping downward very gently of little trees and bushes that live all back in here there you have to make some big decisions where do they live how many are they all kinds of things there is one and we'll let them come right on over here we don't know where they go shoot maybe there's a big one here you can make big ones and little ones and small ones fat ones skinny ones and these trees are just like people they're individuals they each have personalities so make them that way I'm gonna take a little paint thinner on the liner brush we want this to be very very thin consistency of ink and the liner brush has long bristles so turn the brush it loads it full just turn it may be back in here just here and they will just put the indication up some little trunks and stuff maybe even some of these trees just here don't overdo just wherever you want maybe there's an old tree there and a few sticks and twigs all kinds of happy little things now then let's allow that to begin coming forward let's mix we take some Taillow blue and some bright red I'm just going to mix that up with a knife like so this will make sort of a lavender color a little white in it might be a little more white in it there now you can mix this to the blue side or to the red side depending on how much of the bright red that you put in or the blue that you put in it's up to you make a decision all right it's a beautiful color just beautiful I like lavenders okay let me clean my knife oh and we just wiped the knife on old paper towel now then I think we use a fan brush today we just load it full of color just both sides back and forth like so let's go right up in here now you have to make some big decisions maybe and I'm just using the corner of the brush and just wiggling it just wiggle it see so all there is to it just give it a little wiggle but you have to make decisions where these little things live maybe there's a little bush it lives there and another one here give them names if it helps it's alright you know people who paint have an artist license says you can do anything on this canvas that you want to do anything and if you want to talk to your bushes that's alright if you want to give them names that's okay because this is your world right here and there's no right or wrong as long as it makes you happy and it doesn't hurt anybody else then it's fantastic there we go see there and this is just using the corner of the brush and just wiggling back and forth it's very similar to making foam way use if you ever do seascapes with me now maybe down here at the bottom we want to create the illusion of mist so for that we'll take a nice clean brush I'm just going to tap the base of this just the base I want to create a nice soft misty area at the bottom of these bushes very calm peaceful very soft and more you tap the softer it'll become now the thing it gives gifts paintings distance and depth or different planes or different layers in the painting so it's very important to have a lot of layers in here if you want to create that illusion so now this mess that you placed in here is extremely important it's your best friend don't kill it treat it good treat it nice see see how that mist right there those separates those two entities there it can be the same color but the mist is your separator as I say that that's your very good friend and like all good friends you treat it with respect and love and take care of it and it'll do do fantastic things for you there we are and we're still just basically using nothing more in the corner of the brush just the corner of the brush there now once again I want to create that illusion of mist at the base so I take the big brush can just tap just have like so all the way across there we go see how soft that becomes just instantly and maybe here and there you want to put the indication of some little little things that are standing up back in here because we have bushes that are all different shapes and sizes somewhere in front somewhere in back just use your imagination and let it go you know painting allows you to literally place dreams on canvas and that's why we show you how to do there and you can do it you can do anything that you want to do okay very nice I like that that it will take once again paint thinner into the same color we want this to be very thin turn that brush turn and brush and here in there we want a few little sticks and twigs and little trunks and thank these little details make your painting special to make it stand out there we go you know it takes a second to put some of these little rascals in there okay now maybe in our world shoot who knows maybe maybe there's some land back here let's take a little bend like brown and a little bit dark see and I would just mix them together there pull it out as flat as you can get it then cut across get that small roll of paint there you can see it good right on the edge of the knife now then with that roll of paint hold it just like so and you can begin this making big decisions you decide where you landmasses living this see all you got to do just sort of scrub it on just scrub it on maybe that's right under here we don't know we don't know and if you painted with me before you also know we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents and we learn to work with those accidents and things that happen sometimes they're more beautiful and things you you really said and planned so take one let's make a little reflection here I'm just going to take a large brush take a little bit that same lavender color let's go right under here and touch and pull straight down it's important that we go straight down straight down when I was a traditional painter reflections were one of those things that were so beautiful but they drove me crazy and look how easy they are pulling straight down then come across so all there is to it so all there is to it you have instant reflections and maybe we have Taeyang now we have reflection in there let's bring this down maybe it comes right down there like so we'll have a little Peninsula flan coming right out there now once again when you're painting make big decisions maybe you want your peninsula we down here or up there or not at all there's freedom on this canvas it's absolute and total freedom here you can do anything that you want to do anything a little bit more of the reflection straight down it's important to go straight down sometimes a tendency to sort of go to the side but it won't look right it'll make your water look like it's gonna drip off the same Canon would take another fan brush and I have several of each brush going here so I don't have to spend all of my time just washing brushes it is fun but we want to do some other things I'm going to take a little bit of the yellow ochre a little touch of the bright or red not much just a little bright red CAD yellow you write back your little touch the dark Sienna dull it down okay let's go right up in here and then maybe there's some little grassy things back here don't let this color get too bright on us though there we are just some little things I'm just pushing upward with the fan brush now when you're doing this if you begin getting smiley faces just big faces with your fan brush or smiley frowns no that's not right and you know what I mean if it goes the other way turn the fan brush and use more of the corner of it and it'll it'll work right out for you there we go now then tell you what maybe back here in our world their lives their lives a happy little tree and I'll just take some of that same lavender color that we used and let's build us maybe their lives right there there's this trunk and all we're doing is just tapping now we come back use just the quarter the fan brush and let's put in a few leaves own leave some of this trunk showing I don't want it all to go away and leave me this is far away and we're looking mainly for a silhouette back here just mainly a silhouette there just enough so it stands out a little that's all we want then and we'll dip a fan brush into a small amount of liquid white liquid white only thins the paint that's all it does and that's one of our golden rules in this technique a thin paint will stick to a thick paint then to thick add the least little touch of phthalo blue to it least little touch and maybe maybe in our world maybe there's a little water loser right back in here here just float so long as a good time waters free but it's lazy or is lazy it always goes to a recessed area or low area otherwise it'll lay flat keep these lines basically straight basically straighten or to look like your water's gonna run right out of the painting get you floral with okay tell you what must do now I put the water in because you do the thing that's father's to way first and then continually work forward now that let's put some land over here on the other side so we'll go back to our brown that's Vanda and dark Sienna just mix them together pull across pull it out flat pull across and our little roll of paint there way and we have to make some big decisions maybe our land lives OOP right there got to make a little noise as we're doing the work say maybe comes right on up we don't know where it goes wherever you want it to go that's just right and then becomes right there and all we're doing here is just filling that in with color just blocking it in you could put this in with the paint roller it doesn't matter anyway you can get it on there there we are now then take our brush with a little lavender on it coming back and we want a nice dark reflection under that grab it pull it straight down again very lightly go across very lightly notice I'm going across only in this direction if you start out here and come across it'll leave a big straight line out here which you they'll upset you you'll be unhappy with me back to my fan brush where the yellows and a little touch of the bright red I'll load it with some color let's go back in here now then we'll just pop him some little grassy areas that live right out here on this land and if you want to you can just wiggle in a little bush and shrub here and there just make a decision drop it in there wherever wherever you want as I say to me painting represents freedom on this canvas you can do anything that makes you happy okay maybe we'll make that like a little little Bank and sometimes it's nice to have just a little stone in here just a happy little rock it lives there it would take a little white a little little the Van Dyck Brown and come back in here you would put a little highlight on him there just a little and we can just pull it and a little baby Rocco lives right there now right there and he's our friend put some grass right around I tell you what not to you until you sometimes you get excited you see things when you're painting and when you're painting this method don't worry about drawing patterns or tracings look at what's happening let your imagination guide you learn to compose as you paint you see things I see another peninsula here so let's drop it in don't be afraid of it because you can do anything and I know you can I know you can there we are like so this would be a nice place to fish I love to fish but I'm not a very good fisherman I mean I'm a cutter fisherman mad I guess because I catch a fish now put a bandaid on even padding on the tutu and put him back in the water give him a little CPR if it's needed and let him go then next time maybe I can catch him again there I live beside a little pond one time I'd caught something to fish so many times and I think they had scars on the mouth I would just come up and say put it here didn't even bother to bite the bait maybe a little bit of grass right along in here but they literally got to where they would eat out of my hands if you have you have a little patience it's unreal what you can do with animals unreal what you can do with them and they're very nice now then let's go back to our brush it has the liquid white titanium point a little touch of the a little touch of the phthalo blue don't need much maybe the water is coming along here and all of a sudden just falls over we'll just make a happy little waterfall lives right there go over pull down over and down solvers to it where it hits push with a corner make a few little happy splashes now this is a thin paint so you can work over the top of this thicker paint without becoming a mud mixer if you stand and just keep rubbing it you will become a man but just work right over but you need these thick and thin paints if you don't have that you're in trouble the paint that we use the dark colors is extremely firm very dry and that's an absolute necessity okay shoot this is looking nice I'm having a good time today and I hope you are let's go back to summer lavender in the old fan brush and maybe in our worldly lives right there do you know me I like these old big trees there he is we're still looking mainly for silhouettes we're not looking for a lot of detail maybe he's got a little friend there's right there there we go yeah let's take I just use the corner of the brush yet but the indication here and there a few limbs that are hanging there we go just however many you want I don't want to lose all that background so we won't put too many I like that background is very soft and gentle very quiet there my mother likes these kind of paintings maybe will dedicate this one to her she's my favorite lady she likes these little soft paintings there we go now they're having comes of fun tell you what let's bring the camera right up close here and I'm going to pull the contact paper off and let you see what we have this is the moment of truth look at that isn't that fantastic now shoot let's really have some fun we got a minute or so left here so let's have some fun take a bunch of more of that bright red and we put in some blue and I'm gonna reach up here and get some black I want this to be darker midnight black just sort of a mix it all together okay and clean the knife off and grab the old fan brush and we'll load a lot of color into the brush really loaded up a lot of color now that may be in our world there lives a big tree get brave this is your bravery test and it comes right down there like so big strong tree there he is right there okay now I'm going to take the brush that has the light color on it this is just white and then we'll come right along this age and just tap it I want a little bit of light on this one it's a little closer you're gonna see a little bit more detail now then go along the edge first and then begin just tapping and gently blending it over so it gets darker darker darker darker as it comes around a tree that will give you tree the appearance and the feeling of roundness now then we go back to our dark color and here and there and let's just put in just the indication oh nice Liam I hear tonight I'd be careful cuz you'll cover all your background I'm gonna leave some big spaces here there we are I just want to show just just little things in here in some in there alright shoot tell you what we'll take our liner brush a little bit of tan paint will put the indication just a little Leone there we are and I think we better have a finished painting take a little paint thinner go right into my bright red then this down like water and I'll sign this one I certainly hope you've enjoyed this painting it's very simple it'll give you a lot of experience and from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless I look forward to seeing you next time you
