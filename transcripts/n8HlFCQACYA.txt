all right welcome back certainly glad you could join me today such a fantastic day here and hope it is wherever you're at I thought today would just do a beautiful beautiful little painting that's very warm has a lot of very soft colors in it so I tell you what let's start out having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let me show you what I've already done up here got my standard old canvas up here double-prime pre-stretch canvas and I've covered it with just a thin even coat of the liquid white so it's all wet and it's ready to go so let's do a little painting as I say today it's such a beautiful beautiful day let's just do a little painting that's very warm and just wanted to make you happy let's start out with a little dark sienna and I reach up here and get the least little touch of alizarin crimson I'll make a nice warm brown color just tap a little into the bristles let's go up in here and we'll use our little crisscross strokes and just begin dancing in just a happy little happy little area up here like that alright so say this is just going to be a very very warm painting very warm very soft quiet delicate little painting because that's the kind of mood I'm in today there see the paint is continually continually mixing with a liquid white and automatically it gets lighter and lighter in value as it works downward let the canvas work for you shoot there very lightly three hairs and some air all we had to do is just blend that we're going to use that for our background today and that's about all we need now go show you something is fun let's have some fun today we'll go back in the same color a little lizard crimson a little bit of dark sienna and just mix these on the brush you don't worry about it that way you have a multitude of things happening in that brush is just not one old flat dead color let's go back up here now then maybe back here in the background maybe we have some just some little tree indications and Bush indications I'm just going to take the corner of the brush and just sort of rub it just rub it now if you've ever had problems making little bushes and trees this is your painting because this will make it so simple even if you've never painted anything before this you can do without any problem at all they're just the corner of the brush and all you have to worry about is just some very very basic little shapes maybe over here there's one there is one look at that see very soft and quiet maybe there's a bigger one over here whatever but I want these two almost blend right into the sky okay speaking of blending let's take a good clean dry brush and I want to create the illusion of mist so tap it just tap the base not the top just the base just the bottom and that'll make it even softer okay very lightly one hair and some air just barely touching now then if you want to create the illusion of more depth and distance in your painting all you have to do I'm sure it's easier to show you take a little more that same color and when come back in here and maybe maybe there's another one right there let me get just a touch more paint so to show off a little bit better I don't want to change the color too much just enough so you can see the difference but this misty area in here is what separates two good friend take care of it there we go then I'll take another to inspiration I have several of each brush going and just tap it do this tap that's one thing you'll find if you paint and very much if you have at least two of each brush it'll save you a tremendous amount of time and materials because otherwise if you if you have to wash and clean your brush between each time you go back from a dark to a light color most of your color they end up in the bottom of this washer can if you have two or more of each one of these brushes and you can have one for light one for dark hmm it just makes it easier time lazy let's take some dark colors now we'll go into a little bit of midnight black a little Van Dyck Brown a little touch of the SAP green and a little touch of phthalo blue not too much just a little bit just load the brush up again this thing is get closer to you in the landscape you want them to get darker so now they're beginning to get closer so let's come right up in here there is a nice little bush if you see some green in this file that one's beginning to show a little bit more green there so that all these little things happen all we're using though is just the corner of the brush and just making little wiggle so you see there give it a little push that's where they come from a little more of the color and you bury these colors a little bit here and there that's why you mix color on the brush that way you get a multitude of things happening without even working at it they're paying too much fun to turn it into a chore enjoy it tis enough bad things around the house to do that aren't fun you know let's go cut the grass or whatever if you want something that's not fun when you're painting it should be fun for you now I'll take the large brush and just tap it once again once again I want to create an illusion of the mist very soft and very quiet there I just work in layers just layer after layer after layer they have it go back into that Oh color maybe you want to make the indication here of a little little tree oh yeah this is an easy way just touch and Bend just bend and less as you go up there it is see take it other side all you have to do push harder when you want to get wider and that's super maybe let's give him a little friend and you can do as many or as few of these as you want in your world just touch it give it a little push so all there is to it it makes the indication of a nice little tree and you have done virtually nothing take the knife put the indication of a little trunk here and there in it and people will think you've worked for long periods of time to put these inch it's our secret don't tell nobody ok now back to our color let's go back in here and maybe put another layer same basic colors I'm going to use the same basic colors I just want to show you numerous layers in here now this can be made to look very very soft almost like a watercolor when I was in school I took several courses in watercolor and it taught me two things first of all it wasn't my medium to difficult and secondly a tremendous respect for those who could do it to me that's the hardest medium various ways you make a mistake there but this is very forgiving you could scrape this off and start over even now even now then we'll start by adding some yellows and CAD yellow yellow ochre little bright red here and there whatever Indian yellow there you know what I'm putting a song because this can be very repetitious I'm just adding color I wanted to mention recently through our newsletter we had we had an art contest and from all over the country people sent me paintings dolls you wouldn't believe we had just just hundreds of beautiful paintings came in one of the hardest things we've ever tried to do is to figure out whose paintings we liked and who we thought was we thought was the winner that's very hard to come up with but I wanted to share with you today some of the people that had won according to categories so we'll just put those up on the screen here this is Becky Gibson and she's was under six years of age can you believe that fantastic young painter there and then we had Harold Jennings from st. Louis Missouri he was in the six to twelve year old category at here'll he's a son of God look at that painting he's he's gonna be after my job to pretty soon i mean steve Silverman from Virginia that's where our companies located he was in 13 to 18 year old category and Steve has quite a career in front of him I can tell that now and in the category 80 and over that means they're not going to tell you how old they are Ernest Hopewell one and Ernest is a fantastic artist I'm so proud of these people and just overjoyed and as I say it was very hard to pick a winner and I just can't tell you all the beautiful beautiful paintings we had and I hope next time we have one of these little contest that you entered and maybe we can show your painting on here oh I'm just taking all different colors the yellows and just whatever just making layer after layer maybe a little bit bright red mixed with some yellow there just let them bounce back and forth so I say if you practice with this a little bit shoot it'll come out looking almost like a watercolor it's really a very very nice technique and another way you can make oil paintings look like watercolor is use oil washes or just dilute the paint down to this consistency of water and you can make beautiful watercolor effects very easily very easily there we go okay you know it's interesting I get letters and people sometimes they say they're allergic to oil paints so they use another medium most of the time we we find that people are not really allergic to oil paints as much as they're allergic to the turpentine that's traditionally used with painting I'm just putting a little paint thinner to some Brown here let's go up here put in a few trunks we use no turpentine in this technique the only thing that we ever use is odorless paint thinner and most people find they don't have a problem with that but if you've had an allergic reaction to paint before check to make sure it's not just that the turpentine is traditionally used I'm just putting in a few indications here and there are some sticks and twigs and all kinds of things there I really am proud of the artist that we just showed you they have done so much so very much there it was unbelievable to me when I began looking through all the different entries that people had sent because I never knew so many people were painting and they were doing such a fantastic job there we go see how these little things just create that indication we can take a little paint thinner with a light color just white basically in here and there maybe maybe there's some light little sticks and twigs you have those too they live in the woods too okay watch the Oh brush I just watch these little brushes and thinner and then dry them off on a paper towel I don't be banging on them I'm gonna take some dark color now we need a contrast painting is nothing but playing lights against dark darks against light etc maybe right down in here there it is put a nice dark area I'm still just using corner of the brush and just rubbing it just literally doing nothing but we're rubbing just the corner of the brush stuff you'll be amazed at all the different shapes you can make there we go nice dark strong color though let's see how each one of these planes here creates that illusion of depth and to me that's what makes a painting special there we go and you vary it back and forth maybe maybe in here there's a little lighter color that just stands out say they're just layer after layer so many or as few as you want in your world earlier what this is turning into a very nice little area then they have to get crazy in here you know me I can't ever leave well enough alone I have to play with a little so let's let's do some weird things here maybehe I tell you let's come right up in here maybe they're in here we have maybe there's a maybe there's a building here huh let's just scrape out a basic shape give her a little building a place to live I'm gonna put his roof there all this does is remove excess paint and gives you a basic outline would take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown now we can begin blocking it in there there's a nice roof and maybe it comes over to about there hmm Terry here all we're doing is blocking in color you don't have to worry at this point don't have to even be concerned with it a bit on this side don't want him to be left out there earlier now then I'm gonna take a little bit of the Fen Dyke Brown a little bit of bright red touch of white in there just make a sort of a dirty red color and we'll come right down here just put the indication of an old roof here there it is now then let's take let's take we'll use little dark Sienna some whites yellow ochre in it it's always a it's always a tendency to say yellow okra but okra is what you eat in your soup I won't say that now leave this color marbled like this with all different things and we just take off a little roll of paint we don't need much now then let's begin grabbing this let's just put in and I'm pushing very firmly very firmly allowing all those little background colors to mix in with it too straight down straight down down the other side I'm going to take that same color and add a little more of the titanium white to it I want it to be a little lighter but the same basic color alright once again our little roll of paint let's go right out here and we'll just lay in something like this I'm mashing very hard once again allowing it to mix with those colors that are underneath very hard getting mean with it tough with it and I'll wipe the knife keep right on rubbing there we go very nice you get all those effects just automatically like this a nice straight edge down this side pull it right down soon and then want this edge here to be a little bit lighter so it stands apart then we'll come right down okay now tell you I'm going to take a color it's a little bit darker and very very little of it almost none let's go up here and I'm just going to touch and let the knife just sort of bounce around just at random wide you can find the small knife works better for getting in these areas just sort of let it bounce around so this gives a indication of some little distant things that are happening we're not looking for a lot of detail here there but it'll give that impression and shoot maybe it's even made out of old stones all put together just let it bounce there okay see how that it really really helps create an image that illusion and painting is nothing but illusions alright and grab the small knife let's go up here I'll take dark sienna dark seeing that dark sienna and white on quite dark our little roll of paint once again maybe right in here we got a little window soup like that shoot maybe is another on over here I don't know wherever you want to take a little dark paint outline that a little bit not a lot just enough to give an indication there now we get dark paint on there some nice dark Venn diagram I would put a little door there he is okay and we can come back with a lighter color and we just sort of outline that door so it stands out good there we are now then Chiklis use the liner brush maybe take a little bit of this it's dark salmon and white maybe up in here maybe coming out of here somewhere we we don't know where this is coming we'll have a little think I call this a flume it's hard to say little box water runs in just there we go come to write it out of there and maybe down in here maybe there's what remains of an old mill so we just put the indication here the old wheel that's about wore out I notice it's not completely round because you're looking at it from sort of a strange view they're a little dark inside okay maybe a little touch of light color here just to highlight now we need something to hold a Trask 11 so let's have some fun I'm going to take the knife get in here and get a bunch of the liquid white and we'll mix a little dark sienna with it no darks and maybe it's little touch of yellow ochre a little more the sienna there oh that's nice notice how thin this paint is it's literally almost like water very very thin very very thin now they just use let's use the old filbert brush I'm going to go right into some black some black load a lot of paint into the bristle now come right down here see both sides I got black on reach over and just pull one side through that light colour dark light maybe right up here there's a big stone lives there he is and we can put the shadow and the highlight on at one time by using that thin paint there he is because it has to be something for that wheel to to hook on to now then go back here and we'll just scrub in happy little Bush it lives right up here beside it it'll push that rock right back into the distance it's all there is to it oh there is to it you can make just as many of these or as few as you want there we go mana tell you what we'll just take that same old color this is where you have fun here we just fill this in there we are just really throw it in there we don't care you could do this with a paint roller doesn't matter doesn't matter all we have it going maybe over here on the other side here's a nice little bush and I'm still just using just the corner of the brush that's all that is the corner it's all we need and we'll go into a little bit of the other the Browns just vary these colors back and forth back and forth however you want them to be there have it let's take a dip the fan brush into a little bit of liquid white a little bit of titanium white be right back a little touch of the phthalo blue and much maybe maybe there's still a little water trickling down here it falls right down in here we have a happy little splash wanders around little bloop falls over again where do we want it to go we don't care we don't care just any time you want to splash give it a little upward push comes right on down there we go yeah then I go back to my filbert brush with some brown on it a little bit of that thin paint and let's begin dropping in just all kinds of happy little stones wherever you want them just maybe over here there's some to see but you can do the highlight in the shadow all in one stroke there that's Ezz way of putting all these little individual rocks and stones in there they are look at them all down the bank of the stream maybe there's a big one there there see there we go maybe wherever whoever do you have to make these decisions in your world and change the color shoot there's all color stones and rocks there's more okay that gives us something sort of it sort of holds our stream together so it doesn't slip over the bank make a big flood there we go now we just come back with our thin paint maybe right here to me up to you wherever you want it one little waterfall you can have it you can have anything you want on this canvas anything that you want there we just let that wander right on off we don't care where that goes we're ever now then get a little SAP green in there to shooting and then let's just come in here we just tapped in some nice little grassy areas comes right down these stones wherever okay there's one put a few on the other side bring that all together a little bit of grass just hanging right over those rocks and then tell you what let's just let's get crazy here let's get crazy we'll take the old big brush go right into some black all the Browns and etc let's go right up here let's get maybe anything in our world their lives weather does now just a great big old tree oh there go my little some trees in the background but you don't have to do it so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter long as you know how to do them look at that and that a neat way there to do a great big tree see there just drop them off they have it need a trunk got to have a trunk take a fan brush we'll go through a little bit of Van Dyck Brown little Van Dyck Brown then I'll take the other side or yet there you are I'd to find you and go through that light color so we got dark on one side light on the other we'll touch and go and we have a nice tree trunk just like it and we could take our fan brush put a little yellow ochre on today what they come back and we're just putting the indication of a few highlights here they're in it something this is a beautiful way to pick up very nice painting I hope you'll give this a try it's sort of different than what we normally do and it'll open a whole new world to you just absolutely a whole new world it's very soft very nice and it's this particular one is done with extremely warm colors that they just make you happy when you see them hey we could drop in a few little sticks and twigs and it'd be all finished but I think we're going to call this one done today the old clock on the wall tells me it's time to go for right now I look forward to seeing you again until then happy painting and God bless you
