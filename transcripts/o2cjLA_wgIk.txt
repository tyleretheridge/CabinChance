- Hi, I'm glad you could join me today. Today, let's do something
a little bit different. Today I'm gonna start with
a canvas that's just... That's dry, it doesn't
have any magic white on it. So, I'll have them graphically run all the colors across your screen that you need to do this painting, and let's get started. I'm going to start today with
a two and a half inch brush. I'm gonna put a little paint thinner on it and go right into some burnt umber. Very thin paint, and just
a small, small amount. And I'm just gonna put a little
wash up here on the canvas. This is just burnt umber. And just wash the canvas. Just applying a small,
small amount of color. Okay. There we are. Now, really scrubbing that
paint into the fabric. Okay, take a little tiny
bit more of the thinner, and I'm gonna go right into
a little bit of thalo blue. Didn't clean the brush.
Didn't clean the brush. Takes very little of this blue. It's a very strong color. And we'll just throw a
little happy was up here. And by wash, I mean the paint is so thin it's almost like water. This will dry in just a couple of minutes. It'll dry even faster here in the studio because we have all the
lights on the canvas. At home, you might want to give it a few minutes to dry a little bit so it's not so runny. But very thin, very light. Okay. And that gives us a
little background color. That easy. There we go. Alright, let's lay the brush down and today let's have
some fun with the knife. I'm gonna go right in here
and get some titanium white. And let's just start playing, like maybe there some little cloud shapes that
just sort of float around in the sky up here. And this old knife will
do fantastic things. Fantastic things, but you gotta
turn it loose and let it go. Gotta let it go. Be brave with it. See now, it's picking up
that color underneath. And you can make all kinds of beautiful little cloud
effects just using the knife. Just using the knife. Maybe it goes right on
off the canvas there. This is your sky, so you put
things where you want them. Just let them happen. Let them happen. And when you're painting with a knife, normally you would probably use a little more paint than you normally do because it's thicker on the canvas. It has texture when it's dry. Makes a beautiful,
beautiful effect, though. Now, just clean that knife off, and we can just rub this a little bit and it picks up the undercolor and just blends the bottom
of these clouds right in. All the beautiful blues and
browns that we've got there. And there we go. See how easy you can make
a sky just using the knife. So you don't have to have
all the bit fancy brushes. All you need is a nice, nice knife, little practice and have some fun. Now maybe, maybe under this
beautiful little sky here, maybe there's a happy little mountain. I'm gonna take some van dyke brown, and take some prussian blue. Good strong, dark blue. Little bit of alizarin crimson. Just mix them together here. Put a little white in there. Okay, so we got blue,
brown, a little crimson, and a small amount of white. Okay, let's go up here and maybe, maybe, maybe... There it is. I knew there was a big old mountain lived up here somewhere. You just have to sort of find him, decide where he's at and drop him in. That's all there is to it. And when these paintings are dry, they look a great deal
like traditional paintings where you would take washes and glazes and all those good things. These paintings will
give you that feeling. Okay, now I'm gonna just rub that right in like that. Just rub it. Because we want this mountain to be a little bit lighter
down toward the horizon. So I'm gonna rub it, let it pick up that color that's underneath. Any excess paint you can just scrape off. All you're looking for is that dark, dark value in the canvas. There we go. Got some little bumps and things in there. Alrighty, let's put some
highlights on this mountain. Let's take... Tell you what, take some white and a little bit of alizarin crimson. Just a very, very small amount. We don't want to set
this mountain on fire, just wanna warm it up a little bit. And it's also a little easier
for you to see at home. And maybe there's a... Maybe there's a little light that plays right down through here. Just let it strike the
canvas just like so, wherever you think light would strike. Just let it play and have fun. Okay, little bit... Yep, right there. There it is. There it is. Little bit right there. And just let all these things happen. Let them flow right out of your mind. They're there. They're there. Come right down, and down
to some of this color. Let it pick up, blend together. Okay, now I'm gonna take some white, little bit of prussian blue mixed into it. We wanna make a little shadow-type color. And we'll go in here, and just here and there
we'll put some indications of a few shadows. I don't wanna cover up all that dark. Just here and there. A few little shadowy things happening. Want this painting to be very soft and very quiet on this thing. Okay, maybe there's a little light, strikes right out here on that peak. It's your mountain, you let light strike wherever you want it. That's where we want it, right there. There we go, a little
shadow right in there. There's another happy little shadow. Just let those little shadows
play and fall in there. Okay, clean the knife again. There we go. See, just blend it together so it makes it look nice and misty. It's that easy you can just bring that together. Now, I'm really pushing quite hard here. I wanna blend that so that it's misty. Okay, tell you what. Let's have a... Just gonna have a happy
little foothill back here. And for that I'll use a little brown, a little sap green. Let's put some white in it. So we've got some brown,
some sap green, some white. And I'm gonna put into that, we'll just put a little bit of this blue. Just a little blue, maybe. This is thalo blue. There, that's about what I'm looking for. Okay, let's go right up here. Maybe there's a happy little foothill that lives right here. And first we'll just... Still just using the knife. We wanna just use a knife today and show you what can be done. See there? Just drop in. Just a little indication of
a little foothill back here. And then you want it to be
very soft at the bottom. You need that little misty area. That's the separator. That separates everything. Now I wanna just keep
using that same color. Maybe I'll add a small
amount of blue to it, make it a little bit
more into the bluish hue. Let's go right over here. Maybe there's a... Yep, there is. I see it. It's another little bit
that comes right down. So, this is a little darker. It's a little closer to you,
so it stands out a little more. See, I'm just pushing
this up here and there to make it look like
little trees far, far away. And as some things get closer to you, you wanna have more and
more detail in them. Add a little white so
I can create some mist down here at the bottom. And as things get closer, you begin making out color. You can see all kinds of little colors as things get closer. So if you wanted to begin showing the least, least little amount of color, I'll add the tiniest little bit of cad yellow here and there. Tiniest, tineist little bit. Just wanna put an
indication here and there. Don't wanna overdo. Just a little. It's too far away yet, don't want a lot of detail in it. Still too far away. Okay maybe, maybe. Shoot. I'm gonna add a little more brown to that. Same color. A little brown. See, and you just keep making these colors darker as you come closer. And maybe... There it is. There it is. Cover that little hill. See, you can make as many of these little hills as you want Just decide how many hills are in your world and drop them in. Drop them in. You can do anything. There we go. Create all kinds of depth in a painting using nothing but a little old knife. Still same old color. A lot of rubbing. That rubbing makes it
very smooth, it'll... When this is done it'll look almost like it was done with a brush it'll be so smooth I hope, I hope. It's what we're shooting for, anyway. And it takes a lot of
this blending and rubbing. And you can spend hours
and hours on these. They're a lot of fun. A lot of fun. So, a good painting to do when you're not in a hurry and you just... Just wanna have some fun. Little more color right in there. Now, I wanna lighten this a little, so I'm gonna add small amount of white and blend it. And maybe, maybe. There we go. There, another little layer right there. I've just added a little
more blue, a little brown. Put some dark in here and then we can beging working on some shape and some
form, playing a little. Okay, and we'll right into a
little bit of yellow ochre. Yellow ochre, and to that I'll put a little bit of blue. Little thalo blue into my yellow ochre. Makes a nice green, but it's
not so bright and shiny. It's a dull green. Let's go back up here, and maybe you're beginning to make out detail in here. Little, little things
are starting to happen. And you can vary these colors. If it's not bright enough you can add a little yellow. You can make it as bright
or as dull as you want it. Just let these colors play through there. Here and there. And this is an excellent
painting to do to... If you have a lot of
paint left on your pallet, because you can just use
any old color that you have and put all these things together and just make beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful paintings. You'll really make
friends with your knife. And you'll get to know that thing just like an extension of our hand. And that's when the fun really starts. Okay, maybe, maybe go back and get a little prussian blue,
a little van dyke brown. Put a little white into
it, a little sap green. And some more brown. There. Now then. Now then, let's go to the
canvas maybe right in here. Maybe there'd be some water. So we need some... We need a little bit of dark into here to show our reflection. So, I'm gonna just rub some dark in here. Just rub it in. Some over here. I don't wanna kill totally
all of that, but most of it. Let a little bit of that
thin area show there. There. Okay, that'll give us some dark, and onto that we can add light. So I'll take some white, and a little bit of alizarin crimson. We'll get pretty here. There we go, just a nice pinkish glow. And let's go right up in here and just lay a little
of that here and there. Just let it play and have fun. All these little colors just happen. Let's go over here. Pushing very hard right there. Very hard. Okay. Now, you're gonna go into some white and a little bit of... Let's go into some thalo blue. White and thalo blue. Cut across, let's go up here, and we can begin just laying some little watery looks. Right in there. Just come across. Now, these little lines
that you're putting in, they need to be straight. If they're not straight, it's
not gonna look like water. They really need to be straight. There. Just keep going back and forth. Keep them straight. Can't say that enough. Okay, and we can just play
this back and forth, all over. This is just a little
bit of titanium white. And just let it go across there and pick up color. Let little things happen, see? Just touch, come across, and bring all this together. Very lightly. Very, very lightly. There. And that probably sounds loud, but remember this canvas is dry. This is a dry canvas. Normally we're working
with a canvas that's wet, and so you don't hear all that. The knife would just glide across there. And I've got a little van dyke brown, a little burnt umber mixed here. And we'll just put some little areas right here to make it look like where the land comes down into the water. And I'm just touching the canvas. Just touching. This just sort of separates everything. Maybe a few little happy
bushes right along in here. Some of the different yellows. Okay. Clean the old knife off. Maybe, maybe takes some blue and some brown, a little sap green. Maybe, maybe. Yeah. Right in here, maybe
there's a little peninsula that comes out here. So we just lay in a basic shape. Very dark. Very dark. There. And maybe, maybe right underneath There's a little color in the water. We need some of that dark underneath. Create the illusion of the reflection. We need a reflection there to set it down into the water. We'll take some little
blue and some white. Just let that go across. And that easy, that easy. Gives it the impression of water. Maybe just pile up a lot of... This is just all the dark colors that are laying around my pallet. We'll just pick them up. Maybe there's a... Right here, there it is. There's a happy little tree
that lives right there, and we just... Little evergreen, and we'll
just start right up here. There he goes. Just work it back and forth. Back and forth. See there? See there? Evergreens are fun to make with this. And maybe, maybe, maybe there's another little tree, lives here. It's a good way to close in this corner. We'll just make it a little tree. And it's also a good way to use up any, any old paint you got left on your pallet. There, and we'll just come
right around like that. Want to just bring this on around. There it goes. There it goes, there it goes. And this is just van dyke brown a little prussian blue, alizarin crimson. Just, all your dark colors. Just throw all your dark colors in here. Sap green. Here we're just trying to fill up the rest of the canvas
with nice dark color. There. Now these paintings are... They're really a joy to do. They're a lot of fun. A lot of fun As I say, these are the type of paintings I like to spend hours
and hours and hours on. These are mood paintings. If you're in a good mood, oh you can paint some of the most beautiful, delicate things. If you're in a bad mood, if you just had an argument
or somebody kicked you, these are ones you can really
take out your hostilities on. Strong, strong paintings. There, and we've used nothing, nothing but a knife. Except we used that two
and a half inch brush just to put on some wash to
give it some under color. And some of that color
is playing through this. You still can see it, so you have areas that are very thick with paint, areas that are very thin. It makes a beautiful,
beautiful composition. Maybe, now I got a small amount of white. So we'll just take a little white and just begin rubbing it in here. See, let all these little
things just happen. Just let them happen. We'll get some sap green and rub a little green in there. A little green, little
brown, little white. Just play these colors back and forth. Back and forth. I'm gonna keep this
very, very dark in front. Maybe our light's coming from the right. Maybe right here in this
tree there's a little light striking out here on these leaves. I don't want a bunch of color. I'm gonna keep it dark. Just enough so there's a little highlight. A little highlight. A little light maybe striking right here. Isn't that something? Maybe there's a little land coming down. Whatever, whatever. And put a little highlight here, there. Don't want too much. Okay, okay. All kinds of little
grassy things happening. You just see little
touches here and there. Don't really see a lot happening. Okay, let's go over here. Maybe there's one that lives right there and comes right down. Yellow ochre, indian yellow, cad yellow. I'm just mixing them all
together on the knife and just letting them happen. Just whatever, whatever. Let the canvas do the work. Make all those little beautiful things. And this is such a fun painting. I really hope you try it. I really do. I think you'll be... You'll be very satisfied with it. You'll send me a letter and
thank me for giving you this. And I like to hear from you. I don't get to answer all of them, but I certainly, certainly do read every single letter that comes in. Every one. Okay, see. Just play with the color here. Don't let this get too light. Want this to stay very dark so it helps create the
illusion of distance. Go back to the other side over here. We'll put a few little
happy things in here, let them go. Just like so. See, and every so often clean your knife and you can just gently, gently bring this all together. Very light. If it's too bright for you, rub it. There's so much dark on
the canvas it'll pick it up and make all kinds of
beautiful things happen. You can darken it by rubbing it, blending it all together. As I say, this is a super, super painting to use up any paint that you
have left on your pallet. Super, super painting for that. It teaches you to love
color and to play with it. Okay, let's see here. I'm gonna go back and clean up that edge a little bit. Make it look like maybe just a little water line here and there. Just here and there. And by golly, I think we just about got us a painting going. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Maybe you wanna put like there's a little old
stick here that lives. Just take your knife. Sticks are easy to make with the knife. Maybe just drop in a happy little twig. Don't want it too bright. I don't want it to stand out too much. I want it to be very quiet, subdued. Just back here hiding in the dark. There he goes. Just like so. Give him a little arm. And the least little touch of
highlight so he stands out. This is just a light color, looks like it has a little blue in it. I'm really not looking
for a specific color. This is just stuff that's
left over on the pallet. Okay, and we can just blend
him in and let him go. And I think that'll give you a good idea of how you can do a painting using nothing but your Almighty knife. So on behalf of all of us here, we'd like to wish you happy painting. See you next week.
