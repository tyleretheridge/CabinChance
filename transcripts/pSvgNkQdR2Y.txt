- Hi. I'm glad you could join me today because it's a fantastic
day and I thought today we'd just do a beautiful
little painting together. So, I tell you what. Let's start out and have them
run all the colors the screen that you need to paint along with me. While they're doing that, let me tell you what I've
already done up here. I have my standard, old canvas up here. I use an 18 x 24 inch because it fits the
television screen pretty good, but you use whatever you want. And I've just taken some Black Gesso and painted some basic shapes here. Boy, that's. Looks like a big design in there. Just some basic shapes. I have some ideas of where I
want some little trees to be. The Black Gesso is
allowed to dry completely and then, on top of that, this time I've taken a
little bit of liquid clear, in very, very small amount, and I've put a little of that on there and it makes putting a dark color on a transparent color much, much easier. And for the transparent color, we've just used a mixture
of Alizarin Crimson and a little Phthalo Blue in it to make, sort of, a Lavender color. I've covered the entire dark
area with that Lavender. Up here, just liquid White. Okay? I know it seems like
a lot, but it's really not. Liquid White and a little
bit of transparent color. In fact, one of the
biggest questions I get is, how do I tell if a color is transparent? Well, the easy way it to take a little and put it on a Black canvas. If it still looks Black,
it's transparent enough for what we're doing. It may not be totally transparent, but sometimes
semi-transparent is sufficient for what we're doing. If you put it on here, a little color, say, like White, it's very opaque. You put it on here and it looks White, then it's not transparent
enough for what we're doing. Okay? Good. Let's just have some fun today. Let's start with the old two inch brush. And go into a little
touch of Phthalo Blue. Just a small amount. I don't want much. Just tap it into the bristles. And maybe, maybe, maybe. Yeah. Right up here. We'll put in a little touch of skyline. I really do not want to
have a great deal here. About like so. That's enough. I'm gonna was the old brush. Very little color up there. There's the fun part. I thought today we'll take a little Titanium White and a little touch of Yellow Ochre in it. Just a little bit. I just wanna make a nice
little glow back here. Right in here. We'll just put that. That's Yellow Ochre with
a little Titanium White. Just in those light areas. And just sorta let them
blend together gently. Be very careful though, because Yellow Ochre
mixed with Phthalo Blue will make a bright Green. So don't use very much of either color. Be very, very careful. That's on of the reasons
I've used Lavender in here. It's because, if the
Lavender touches the Yellow, then all that happens is it
turns a nice Brownish color and we don't mind that today. Okay. Now I clean of the old brush again. Now then. One of the nice things
about using the Black Gesso, is that it paints all of
the dark areas for you. So, I'm going to take
this old two inch brush and tap into a little bit
of that nice Lavender color that I've covered the Black areas with. Now I'm gonna just begin tapping in some very basic little shapes. There. Very basic. Virtually no paint on the brush. I mean, this i just almost no point because you can pick up whatever
you need off of this area, where you've already put it. Begin forming some very
basic, little tree shapes. Very basic. That's all we're looking for. Just general shapes. We're not looking for detail
or anything else at this point. All we're looking for is
these nice, basic shapes. Maybe in here. Just all kinds of little
background things. Very soft. Very gentle. Very quiet. You can just barely see them in places. Just let them whisper at you. But all the time, see, the Liquid White is mixing
with the colors all here, then that's all mixing
with the colors here. And you get these beautiful, beautiful blended effects automatically. If you try to do this in traditional painting methods, it would take you a long, long time to create this beautiful, misty affect. And here, as you know, if
I go over thirty minutes, well, they have no sense of humor at all. But already you can see all
kinds of little background trees and just little happy things happening. And virtually, you have done nothing. All you've done is spread
a little color out. Okay. There. And you begin seeing shape
and form as you do this. And when you're doing it at home, don't just try to copy
what I've done here. Look at your painting, because every single
painting will be different. It'll be unique. We don't use any patterns here. We don't trace pictures on here and try to just fill in the blocks. We really teach you how to be creative, how to use your imagination. If you just trace a painting
on a canvas and do it, you know, all you've done is
taken somebody else's idea and filled in the block. I wanna teach you how to
create your own masterpieces. Okay. Now then. Just beat it to knock
off the excess paint. The more you do this,
the softer it'll become. It'll just get so soft, that it just absolutely
disappears after awhile. Wipe the brush on a paper towel or an old rag, if you have it. Look at that. I just love these very
soft, blended effects. Alright. Now then, tell you what let's do. Tell you what let's do. Let me find my liner brush. We'll go into some paint thinner and I want to make a
paint that is very thin. Very, very thin. It will literally run right on the palette if we're not careful. It's the consistency of ink. Turn the bristles. Bring it to a nice, sharp point. This liner brush has
very long bristles on it, so it holds a lot of paint. Now then, we want to put the indication, just here and there, of a little trunk. A few limbs. Some sticks. Some twigs. Little happy things in here. There we go. See them? Just put them in wherever
you think they might live. Wherever you want. And we're using exactly the same color that we made the trees out of. So it doesn't stand out
too bright or too dark. It's the same color. Want to retain that. Maybe over in here there are
a few that go clean on up. We don't know. Tress grow just however makes them happy. Just as many or as few as
you want in your world. Maybe there's one. Yup, you're right. Now I'll get to asked quite frequently, is it best to make tree branches and limbs by pulling the brush down or going up? Doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Some people will find that it
works better one way for them, others will find it works
better the other way. Try both ways to find the one that works best for you and enjoy. There we are. You can go back to this brush, that we used to do all this tapping, and just tap here and there and soften a few of those
so you don't see all of it. You just see little areas, here and there. And that really helps push it back, again. Makes it look even farther away. Even more misty. Now then, let's get the old, round brush. Round brush is fun. I want to take and, far
back in the distance, I'll grab a little Green. Be right back. Grab a little of that Green. I want this very dark though. It's too bright, so I'm gonna
put a little Black into it. Maybe even a little but of this Lavender. There, I want this dark because I want it very subdued. Very quiet. I don't want this to
stand out and bite you. Now then maybe, back in here, you can make out the indication, just barely though, of some basic, little
tree and bush shapes. Just barely though. Begin thinking about
little individual things that are happening in here. These are very far back in the shadows. They're quiet. Now, in your painting, maybe
you want them brighter. If you do, all you have
to do is add a little bit of the Yellow or Yellow Ochre. Whatever. They all get brighter. And against this Black background, they'll jump out like a firecracker. But today, we want to keep them sorta subdued in this painting. Maybe up in here we're beginning to see an indication of a few little things. We can drop those in also. All we're looking for is
very distant little shapes. Very, very distant little shapes. Don't worry about it
too much at this time. Because you're not committed. You're certainly not committed. These trees, right in this area, I'm gonna leave them alone. I want them to remain
that quiet, that subdued. They're gonna be far, far away. Now you can to this with
a multitude of colors. I just happen to like Lavender today. But you can do it with any color you want. You can do it with Pinks or Blues or whatever makes you happy. As you've heard me say a million times, painting should make you happy. If it doesn't make you happy, then something's wrong. You're doing the wrong thing. It's like working. The man that does the best job is the man who's happy at his job. And for half my life I did a job that I really wasn't happy with. I did it because I didn't
have anything else to do. And then I started doing this and this has made me happier than anything that I've ever known. Painting can change your life. It can change everybody's life. I get letters every day from
people who have discovered, that have discovered the show. Maybe there were sick for a few days, or they were injured, and they
happened to be laying at home and flipping the channels
and they come upon this show and they sorta get captivated by it. And they continue to watch it. And it has, literally,
changed hundreds and hundreds, thousands of people's lives. I'm gonna use a little green,
here, on the big brush. I get a lot of letters from people who have retired from an occupation and they want something
to do with their time. And this is one of the
most fantastic things that I think everybody,
at one time or another, in their life has had the
desire to create something. To put something on canvas. And we make it very simple here. You can do it. I'm just gonna tap in some
little, soft little grassy area. Right in there. Maybe it comes right on back. Wherever you want. Just
sorta think about it. But I want them to get very, very dark, away from that light area up here. Back in here. Quiet. Quiet. Barely can you even see them. Very quiet. And this is where we begin
worrying about things like the lay of the land
and how the land flows. Now, the more you tap this,
the darker it'll become because it will pick
up that Lavender color that you have underneath. And it will, literally,
just disappear, basically. If you tap long enough, it'll go. It'll leave you. Tell you what. Maybe there's a little path in here. That's just a perfect
place for a little path. We'll take a little Van
Dyke, a little Dark Sienna. A little touch of Yellow in it. Not much. I mean, White. I'm sorry. I said Yellow. When you get old, the mind goes. There we are. Pull it out flat. Cut across. We've got our little roll
of paint right out here. Now then, we're gonna have
a little path in here. Let's just take, barely touching the canvas, just caress it. Rub it gently. Make some decisions. Where does this little path live? Where does it go? You have to decide those things. In your world, you have
absolute and total power. And this canvas is your world. You can do anything here. Anything that you want to do. There we go. All you have to do is have
a vision in your mind, be willing to practice a little bit, and place it on canvas. That'll give us basic, basic shape for a path. We'll take a clean, dry brush and very lightly, very lightly I want to just make this a little more subdued. A little more quiet. Just by gently brushing it that easy. It'll become much, much softer. Once again, it's picking up that Lavender color that's underneath. Automatically it will
get darker and darker. Okay. A little more of my Dark Green here. Two inch brush. And just push that brush. Gets that little ridge of paint right out on the edge of the bristles. And that's what you're
actually painting with. Okay. Let's go right up here. Once again, begin thinking
about the lay of the land. By putting that in, it pushes a path back, because it's in front. Work in layers. Do the thing that's in your
mind that's farthest away and work forward, forward, forward. There we go. We just let that disappear
back in here, somewhere. The reason I started putting
this liquid clear on the Black, before I put color in, I've got so many letters
from people saying that it's so difficult to put this very dry,
firm paint over Black that they either get too much, or like me, the arms gives
out before they get it all on. If you put just the least, and I can't say that enough, the least little touch of
the liquid clear on first then you're color will,
literally, just slide on. Probably the biggest, single mistake made is applying too much. Let's go on the side here. And if you apply too much, oh, it's worse than not having any. So be very sparing with it. Be very careful. Be a Scrooge with it. Hang on to it. Now then, we can just take a fan brush and just gently go in here and bring all this together. Very lightly. Very delicately. Just bring it together. Now, look how that path
just goes right on back. It does because this is brighter
back here than it is here. Plus, the fact that it gets
larger as it comes towards you. It looks like you could walk
a million miles back in there. And you've really done very, very little. Very, very little. I'll tell you what let's do. Take my old fan brush. We'll just use it. I'm gonna take. Let me find a place to work here. Too many things going in. Let's take some Van Dyke
Brown, a little Dark Sienna. We'll put a little Black in too. I just want a dark, dark Brown. Basically all we're looking
for. Very dark Brown Let me clean my knife off. I just wipe the old
knife on a paper towel. We'll use a fan brush today. You could use whatever. Fan brush looks good today. Maybe, in our world here, maybe there lives a very
large tree, right here. I know that's hard to see. It's so dark. But it's there. It is there. Maybe he's got a friend. You know me and my friends. Just sorta take a look, see, and think were a friend would live. Drop it in. Drop it in. Like so. There we go. Alright. I hope you saw the show earlier. We showed our contest winners. We had a little contest
through our newsletter. Son of a gun, we had
some beautiful paintings. Maybe there's one right there. I was so impressed. It' such a privilege to share that with you because there's people
all over the country that are doing some of
the most beautiful things you've ever seen. And only a few months,
maybe a year or two ago, they never believed that
they could paint anything. And you can do anything that you wanna do. It excites me so much, I get excited just talking about it. The fact that people are
able to accomplish this because it makes you feel good. There, that'll give us some big trees. We need a forest there. So we just lay this brush down. I want to take some
White, some Dark Sienna. Maybe the least, least little touch of bright red. Just enough to stain it a little bit. Notice all the different
colors happening in there. Cut across. Our little roll of paint, as usual. Now then, let's just put in some highlights. Just barely let them. If you've painted
mountains with me before, all you're doing here is
laying snow on the mountain. It's the same, exact stroke. Same touch. You just barely caress the canvas. Just barely touch it. Barely, barely touch it. Maybe, here'e on. Just let it flow right down the tree. Bloop, bloop, bloop. Like so. Isn't that a super way of making a very affective little tree? A little bit back here. I don't want as much back here. I want him to remain, sorta, hidden. You can see him. You know he's there, but he's a little farther back. Let's go on the other side. These trees over here. To me, the light source is
right here, in the center. So light would come in both
directions through there. So we can go over here and we can highlight
this side of the tree. There we are. Something like so. A knife works just as well on
one side as it does the other. Okay. A little bit back in here. Doop, doop, doop. Sometimes it's fun to
take a tiny little bit of Blue and White and just here and there add a little touch of Blue
on the far side of the tree to indicate reflected light. That nice sometimes. Let's go on the other side. Do the same thing. Just here and there. I'm not gonna put a whole bunch in. Just enough that you know it's there. It's fun to go back with your dark Brown and you just tap and you
can bring it all together. You can make some of the most beautiful
tree trunks this way. Just tapping. That dark will allow you to
blend these colors all together. And they look real. They look like you can touch them. Let's go on the other
side and do a couple. Then we'll get serious here. We have to decide what we're gonna do with
this painting pretty soon. Take a large brush and down here, around the bottom of the trees, put a little bit of grass. That'll, sorta, just
blend it all together. A little over here and here. And wherever. We've got a forest there. Take a liner brush. We'll use a little bit of Van Dyke Brown, or Black or whatever. We don't care. Just Van Dyke Brown. Make it thin like ink, again. Maybe, so it'll show up, I'll add the least little
touch of White to it. Just so it'll show up. Let's see now. Maybe there's a. Let's make this. Yeah, that shows up alright. There's a nice little tree limb, right out through there. Put another one over in here. As many or as few as you want. Back here in this little tree, it needs some little limbs that stick out. He's gotta have an arm too. He needs an arm. There. Maybe, one of these days,
we can have one hour shows and I can show you even more things. I get a lot of people writing and saying, is there any way you can
keep this show on longer? I wish there was. Maybe one day. In the meantime, we do create a whole line of instructional videos, which are different than
the television shows. And they do a lot more teaching. Maybe that will help. Some of them are as much
as three hours long. There. A little more of the paint thinner. And let's go over here and we'll do the same thing, like so. You know, I have to
share with you something that I'm extremely excited about. We have just finished writing
our first hardcover book. Gosh, I think it'll be out
by the time this comes out. I think it'll be out and the book will be
in all the bookstores. I'm just thrilled to death over this because it's the things
that I've wanted to do and I've never had the opportunity before. I think you'll enjoy that. Alright. Now, then. Let's just use a one inch brush. We'll take the least little
bit of the liquid White. Go into some Yellow. A little bit of Sap Green. A little Yellow Ochre too. What the heck. I wanna just put the indication
of a few little leaves. I don't wanna lose this background. So I just want to put some nice, little leafy things that are living. Here and there on these trees. Just here and there like that. Don't let them get too bright on you. Just a few. Just a few. There we go. On the other side. Let's drop in a couple over here. Okay. Coupled in there. Alright, I think maybe today we'll have some fun. Let's get brave. We've got a minute or two left here. So, I'll show you
something else we can do. Tell you what. Let me find. Okay, we'll use this. This is a Filbert brush. I'm gonna take a little
bit of the Bright Red. Maybe in our world. Let's get brave. Come right down here. Maybe, we'll take, and just do that. Something like so. Like that. We'll go right over here. Get a little bit of just Yellow Ochre and we'll do something like so. We'll just have some fun. What the heck, maybe. There, like that. I'm just wiping the brush in between. We'll use a dark color over here. Like that and I'm gonna
get the liner brush. A little bit of paint thinner. I'm gonna go into. We'll go into Black. Have you figured out what that is yet? We'll just go into a little bit of Black. Come right up here. Look it, there. Maybe we have a lady there. Has nice long hair. You can put little indications
of people in there. That easy. Here's one over here. We better give her a head. She probably gonna get upset,
as she doesn't have one. Ain't no ideas. There we are. This one's got a little but bushier hair. It's not as long. Few little accents here
and there. Whatever. Maybe we have, now, two ladies who are walking along, here, looking at this beautiful scene. Put a little hat on
that one. What the heck. But that will give you an
idea of a very simple way of putting a couple of
people in your painting. Hope you enjoy that and will try it. Think we'll sign this one. Use a little Bright Red. A little paint thinner. Liner brush. And we'll sign it. When you sign your painting, you just remember, that
a hundred years from now, somebody will look at this painting and know you were having a fantastic day and, on this day, you
experienced the joy of painting. Happy painting and God bless my friend. (theme music)
