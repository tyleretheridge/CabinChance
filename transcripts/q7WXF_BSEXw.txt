hi I'm Bob Ross and I'm glad you're with me today so today let's do a fantastical seascape tell you what let's start out and have run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this little picture at home and why they're doing that tell you what come on up here let me tell you what I've already done I've got my standard old canvas up here and I've painted the entire canvas with black gesso I'd allowed that to dry and then I've came up here and I've sort of added some colors I've put a little bit of lizard crimson mixed with black and a touch of phthalo blue up in the sky area and down here in the bottom I put some phthalo green phthalo blue and black and just covered the whole canvas with a nice thin even coat of those colors those colors are transparent so when you put them against a black background it still looks black and on to that we're going to add different colors and fantastic things will happen I think you'll enjoy it so I tell you what let's get started and do it let's start off today with a small amount of titanium white and I'm using the little one-inch brush and tell you what let's make a happy little let's make a happy little sky up here and let's just take the brush and sensor's color already on the canvas here all you have to do is just sort of touch all I'm doing is just sort of touching and putting in all kinds of just happy little shapes just like so we'll just let that go right on off there we go see there all you have to do is tap very very easy and once again because there's color underneath you'll pick up that color and just fantastic things will happen or you can just rub it a little just like so just scrub a little of the white on there then all these things begin happening there see just whatever you want maybe over here let's do another one of those these are going to turn out to be big fluffy clouds but all we're doing right now is just tapping in a very loose base shape just a base shape basic shape whatever you want to call it we're not looking for detail at this point we're going to cut back and again worrying about detail right now all we're doing is adding some color onto the canvas okay now then tell them let's take a good dry two inch brush be sure it's dry and very lightly we're just begin brushing here just brush and I'm going to brush the base of this out but I'm not going to touch the top yet just blend it out let it blend right into that color that's on the canvas that's fantastic they're these black canvases are one of my absolute favorites now very lightly just lift that lift it and blend it there we go just bring it all together lift it and sort of pull it up that way I'm doing that real slow see and see just pull it and it makes one of the most fantastic little skies and it's so very easy there we go just like so now right across the center here I have a piece of masking tape I just want to keep the horizon lines nice and straight on the seascape so that's just plain old just plain old masking tape cut across there let take a fan brush with a little bit of white on it and maybe you want to go back here and just add in some little some little things here and there all you do is just lay in some basic shapes wherever you want wherever you want and go back to your large brush and blend them and you can blend them to any degree of darkness that you want the more you blend this the darker it's going to become because it's going to pick up the color that's on the canvas the base color underneath and you can just keep on to blend it all the way if you want to but hopefully we won't go that far really add it let's pull the masking tape off and we'll have a nice straight horizon see there that masking tape really does keep your horizon just as straight as it can be I hope you can see that I know it's difficult on a black canvas with a black background now then where the tape was I'm going to add a little bit of black and stay low blue just right in there with the tape bus because there was no color there being careful to keep that horizon line nice and straight nice and straight okay now then time to make some big decisions one of the things that I like to do when doing seascapes is determine right from the beginning where my major waves going to be and then it seems to work easier if you know where that waves going to be in you work around it so I'll just use the little filbert brush here put a little white on it and let's make a big decision maybe our major wave will be right about here and it'll come right about here and go out and it's going to come up a little bit and then sort of break over right in this area and maybe there will be the big break and that's really all you need that tells you where you can work and where you can't more important because where you can't work good man we draw for a little filbert and we can have some fun let me get a fan brush here maybe back here in the in the distance let's mix up I will use some black little touch a blue little touch it phthalo green throw some fan deck Brown there too just to dull it down and just mix them on the brush no big deal maybe back in here far far away there's some distant little trees left so I'm just going to take the brush and I'm barely touching the canvas I want these to be quite light in value these are far away I don't want them to two distinct well I'm just to be back here in the mist she must've missed I'm just hiding back here in the background somewhere there I think you can see them but they're not real distinct now closer up on this there me a few trees that are much more distinct I have a few little evergreen setting out here there we go there in them little rascals hardened you just put as many as you want in your seascape or as few maybe you don't want evergreens in yours maybe you want to have some some old trees that hang over and lean that's all right anything that you want I just want to show you how to do this and did you decide how you want to do it there okay use that same color and let's put in maybe a little footling back here just a little Rokit rocky area that projects out into the water there we go see all we're using here is just that same old dark color there have brushstrokes at this point become very important you can lay this completely out using nothing but brushstrokes normally I put no color there just the dark but no highlights on it just the dark color and let the brushstrokes put the indication of all kinds of little things in there you can even lift up even if this doesn't show in your TV when you do your painting it will certainly show you can see all kinds of rocks and stones and it suddenly you're hiking you long back in here now if you want you can add the least little touch of white to your brush maybe that'll there you can see that better as I say I normally wouldn't do this I just want you to be able to see it but just with brushstrokes you can create all kinds of happy little thing back here that's wherever you want them there we go okay all right now we can come in here and start playing when we find another fan brush I have several fan brushes going so I don't like to spend all my time cleaning brushes it will take just straight 'el titanium white straight or white odhh brush both sides and let's go up here and let's make a decision here here's our horizon so let's just start putting a little and I'm gonna exaggerate I'm going boo boo boo boo okay gotta make that noise - but just small back in there just think a little waves little waves splashing way back in there and leave some dark areas don't don't cover up all these sometimes it gets to be fun and you can't stop em you know just work it out see and already that begins giving the indication of water and is picking up that color that's on the canvas and all these little things just just happen automatically you don't even have to worry about them and maybe let's come right in here and here's a big major wave comes right along in there and lives and goes right on through hmm and this wave we said came right along here I get and then it's gonna come right over to once again helps to make the little noises I of course people look at you a little funny but that's all right there then they wipe my fan brush off just remove the excess paint and now that all I want to do a watch it's easier to show you here where you put this paint begin blending it back but you're still making a little stroke like that okay hope all that makes sense there see what's important is not this line that you made here but in-between that becomes the trough or the area between the leaves and just by pulling out a little bit of paint back and that stroke automatically you can create that illusion automatically there we go it's very gently half it begins getting too bright just clean your brush off just wipe your brush off good okay then a little bit here takes very little paint on these black canvasses I think they're one of the most fantastic things there I love these black canvases some of the effects are unreal they're madan you make a decision here where this little foot Lyn sticks out in here you just take your paint and cut it off there we go found it yeah then shoot without get that rascal looking good but you see how easy it is to make this whole background with just a fan brush and a few happy little strokes okay let's get on down here start playing I'm gonna take some titanium white and the least little touch of CAD yellow least little touch of cadmium yellow this may still look white or you own you said but there's a little yellow in here don't get too much all right now then right in here the eye of the wave or the transparency take a filbert and scrub it firmly firmly just scrub it in there you go now begin thinking about the shape of this wave it'll work back getting darker darker darker darker darker darker it just disappears okay now you can do this as many times as you want to achieve any degree of likeness in this I of the way that you want some people call it an eye of the wave some people call it a transparency which ever if you want to do it again the big thing is to start with a clean brush be sure your brush is clean you always want that fresh clean paint right there in the transparency load the brush full go back and start again always start in the light area and work outward say there and think about shape again thinking about the shape see this waves coming up and curling over here so their shapes like yes let me just do it in the sink see it there darker darker darker darker darker darker darker till it just disappears right on out to nothing there and sometimes when I'm doing these maybe I'll do that three four times whatever it takes to get it as bright and slightest as I want it and when you're doing yours just take a look at it make a big decision and do it now use a two-inch brush and very delicate gentle gentle touch I hope you can see that just sort of using just the top corner of the brush all you're doing is just mixing it up don't make big old strokes the brush is hardly hardly moving you're just barely caressing the canvas just enough to blend this together and you can make it as smooth as silk just just very gently and let it blend right on out let's take it there look at that I used to go crazy trying to do seascapes this is such a super nice easy way to do it pick that water look at that there I just blend it as you go and you can grab it begin pulling it you begin to thinking of the shape of the wave hears it moves and turns there and I beat the breast just to remove excess paint now then let me find a fan brush it's clean let's start making the crasher here for that I'll go right into titanium white plano titanium oi cuz once again when we get up here and begin working it's going to pick up the color it's underneath now maybe this wave comes over and says have to make the little sounds think about the water I think about the water water isn't moving it's having a good time out here there we go and it's just splashing and churning oh there and it's crashing over here boom okay wash shuttle Canberra and we just wipe it on a paper towel okay now then now comes the fun part grab the old filbert brush I like to put the foam on there for that will take a little white and a little bit of this color we used this is blue with the least little touch of crimson in it so it's sort of a lavender color there we go just load the brush full and we're gonna put the shadow in the foam first and we'll come back and put the highlights open so start right up here and just sort of give the brush a little a little wiggle little tiny circles now sometimes there's no foam right here that's up to you I like to put some phone there because it it just looks good to me tiny little circles we're just scrubbing it in and think about think about where there's a churn and hit and splash and come back up over itself and just throw it all in there they're like fantastic that easy now to our brush you sure it's good and dry it's not good and dry it's gonna thin your paint and cause you agony and agony hurts there we go I load this up with white loaded full of color a lot of color see both sides of the brush are very full okay now then hold a brush sorta like this see it sort of side birds in touch and just give it a little upward push right on top of that see it's on top of that shadow push it it's hard to do it slow so are you doing just giving a little upward push see that and way that bright parts right out on the edge and wipe your brush continually look at this big splash up here where it's hidden okay now don't kill all your shadow it's very easy you get carried away sometime you can kill all that shadow and you need that dark part underneath there I just want to look right and then I wiped off the brush and I'm gonna scroll sort of blend that together so there's no harsh lines where these two come together just sort of blend it together until the load hardihood easily there you there you go you could do it with a clean dry two inch brush and all we're using is just that very top corner just the top corner just the top corner and we want to stir this up a little bit see we're not making big strokes a brush hardly moves you can blend this till it's just too smooth as glass and you may have to do it once or twice to get the feel of it but it'll work for you oh people would never believe you used a two inch brush to make such delicate beautiful little foam and you take a little of that and put on the outside just touch out here so it looks like little thing sparkling in the air little midians a little water droplets going all up there okay now one thing that'll help separate this wave will take a little bit of paint thinner in my liner brush and just go into some dark color just a little bit of paint on the liner brush now we need something here to separate so just take the liner brush and just come right around and it'll cause these two areas to separate it really make us son of a gun stand up there then you take a dry brush and just blend that out too you can't even see it there you go daddy yeah we can start having some fun now we need some foam in here for that I'll just use a fan brush you can use the filbert of the fan or the liner whatever you happen to have handy this has already got white on it so begin thinking about the way the wave is coming up and turning over back here it's still quite flat but in here it has turned all the way over so just use a the brush and begin creating that illusion this is where you should form and shape your wave just with this foam here we begin making all these little things that just play right along here there and we'll come back and put detailing all we're doing now is just putting in some basic basic shapes there we go wherever you want to go where your cover you want them to go there but don't kill all your dark areas as I say this begins working in is so much fun next thing you know you've killed every bit of dark area that you had I do that all the time so if it happens to you you're certainly not alone you've got a lot of company but here here we go now you can sort of blend that up a little if you want yeah find my liner brush let's begin putting some nice highlights in there for them we'll just use paint thinners a little bit of titanium white with a least little bit of phthalo blue in it add it just to come in here and you can begin adding all kinds a little delicate things these are the things here that really make your painting stand down all these little details and once you get a little dark on there didn't get enough dark yet I'll get something in a second there there we go think about where light shining through here and spend some time really you want to use to Sparkle if these are going to be in the bright light you can take a little pure white even maybe with a little touch of Y and just begin working these right where you want the light area to be though if you use too much of this it won't be effective just where you want the brightest areas so this sort of leads you right up into them maybe right along in here again putting in all kinds of little things back in here all these little details that's what makes your painting really stand out and makes it special see income from back here but all kinds a little let him follow the basic shapes though there we go look at that you ever think you could do that can a seascape that quick you can you really can see a little thing says playing down all these little finds it distil playing the waves and have fun and the more those you put in the more detail you have the better your painting a look there we go huh that's something I thought you'd like guess what today and back in here there we go so you can see little things back in the wave and sometimes these are on the other side the way even you can just see them through the wave but there's absolutely no limit to what you can do you're limited only by your imagination there and imagination is like everything else like every other muscle in your body the more you use it the stronger and kids begin practicing composing scenes in your mind and very soon you'll be able just to make up thousands of little scenes in your mind that's when it really gets to be fun and let's go way up in here and we'll put all kinds of little things back in here there we go okay see all those little rascals and they all add detail and make your painting so special there okay phew back in here if you ever get one that's a little too bright just work with it it'll go away tell you what let's have a little stone in the front here you know me I always like to have little stones I'll use the small knife Van Dyck Brown little dark Sienna in it and at school maybe our little stone lives sure does now right there there's just a happy little stone King will takes a little dark so you know at least a little touch of white in it want this to be quite dark I don't want it to be too distracting right up here in the front quite dark our little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife okay and all we're doing here is just bumping just barely touching just want a little bit of light on that stone then we can take our liner brush and just very gently bring a little bit of water at a parameter C there and let that little rascal just fit right in there now let's have some fun I didn't tell you quite everything there's a piece of contact paper on here and I want to pull that off and let you see what's underneath all I did was put the contact paper room then I painted the canvas black now we take that off look at what you have it hidden had one of the most fantastic little seascapes the chair Justine I thought you'd like that that is so super then we can just spend our remaining time today just putting in some details like so and signing the painting I really hope you've enjoyed this one I also hope you'll give it a try because you'll find it unbelievably rewarding some one of the most fantastic ways to do a seascape that I've ever seen and with that we'll call that one finished from all of us here happy painting and god bless you
