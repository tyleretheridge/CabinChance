hi I'm glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting what come on let's do it let's start out and have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to do this painting with me and they'll come across in the same order that I have them on the palette starting with the titanium white and working around I thought today would do a beautiful little winter scene I'm you know partial to winter scene since I lived in Alaska for so many years so let's go up here and do it I've already covered the canvas with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white it's wet and select ready to go Dan we'll start out with a little touch of the bright red and let me say that again a little touch it is very strong just tap a little bit into the two-inch brush there it's just a small amount I guess go right up here and maybe we'll come let's go right in here just put in a happy little global don't want to set this on fire all we want to do is create a little glow right across here be careful once again this bright red can eat up your whole world in just a heartbeat there now that's mixing with a liquid white and you get a beautiful warm glow and maybe we'll just put a little bit right down in here what the heck anything we don't like we just cover up and if we like it it's already there without cleaning the brush same old dirty brush I'm gonna go right into the least little touch of Indian yellow it's a very transparent now I'm allowing that red that was already in the brush to mix with the yellow there we go okay just go back up here now right above the red small amount of the Indian yellow and use a little crisscross strokes little X's and just blend all that together it's like so very soft and very quiet we can just take the clean off the brush down here we don't care now then I have some midnight black going right here I'm going to take a little black and a little bit of the phthalo blue and we just mix it together right on the brush just tap it I still have not cleaned the brush I'm lazy if I can keep them clean the brush boy I'm all for that can't just go right up in here still use the little crisscross strokes and drop in a happy little sky yeah back and forth gonna come right down into there like so get a little touch more of the color I just black the black in there just to just a gray it a little bit alright okay let me clean the old brush now as you know that's my favorite part of the paintings is cleaning this whole brush shake off the excess just give it a nice little wrap there okay now with just a clean dry brush and be sure it's dry you sure it's dry that may be one of the biggest single problem areas we we hear people talk about is that the brush is not dry and they wash their painting drip right off on the floor let me get upset with me and I really I really want this to work for you and I want you to be happy with it there we go okay very soft and gentle just so you can blend this to any degree of softness that you want just sort of look at it make a decision and go for it this is your painting your world so you can you can create any kind of illusion that you want on this piece of canvas let's have some fun take the old round brush I'm gonna go into a little bit of the Van Dyck Brown little dark sienna and just tap it tap it very firmly let's go right up here maybe right in here we back in the distance lives a few happy little trees just like so this would have been a good scatter well we might do it yet we might put a happy little cloud in there go ahead and put these in yes like so there we go these will be far far away okay tell you what let's do put a little cloud in there just want to show you how to do that we'll use a fan brush today go right into the titanium white pull it through a little lot of paint into the bristles a lot of paint okay let's go up here maybe right in here lives a happy little cloud I use just the corner of the brush turn it wiggle it normally you should do this before you start putting your background trees in I just changed my mind decided I want to put a little cloud in here but when you're doing this at home I would I would really advise you do it before you put your background trees it'll save you a lot of trouble there they have it let's take a nice clean dry brush and I'm using just the top corner of the two-inch brush to blame the bottom of the clouds out barely touching tiny little circles tiny little circles see there now after that bird this is a big circle big grab it lift it upward you're still just barely touching the canvas and then very lightly blend the entire sky see thanks and that here you can drop in a happy little cloud clouds used to drive me crazy when I was traditional painter I'd worked for days trying to put in a little clown I'm going back to my round brush the dark Sienna the Van Dyck Brown so you just really tap it in there get tough with it tap hard just go back up there I tell you I'm having so much fun these little trees yeah there's one he lives right there we don't wanna get loneliness giving a friend his friend lives there whatever we're going down here we really don't have to worry about down here yet a little bit later we'll begin to worry about such things but right now all we're doing is applying some very very basic little shapes I just want that pinkish glow to be really shining through the trees look at that nice tree that lives there think about the shape of a tree just think about it make up little stories about trees it's a little taller you can get carried away with these I'd like to do trees you know buddy travel all over the country doing demonstrations for for PBS stations and other fantastic groups all over the country and it's unreal some of the fantastic new modern equipment they've come out with recently I was doing a demonstration in a small town and there was probably about 150 200 people had showed up and they they gave me up and tastic me microphone and it was wireless and I didn't have any wires or anything on and I forgot it was on so just before the show I went to the bathroom needless to say with a wireless mic when I came back everybody knew her I'd dinner I don't even worse what I've been doing to be careful some time all right a basic tree lying in here if you want to call it that we're doing is just tapping now then let's take the script liner brush and I'll dip it in a small amount of paint thinner and I want this paint to be just like water a liquid turn that brush that pulls it to it a nice sharp point see how sharp it is and it has long bristles on it get scoop here now here and there I did a happy little tree trunk just drop me wherever you want maybe there's wine that lives right there and let these old trunks just sort of wiggle and jiggle and carry on we don't want them all to be future telephone poles keep it moving if you have trouble making your paint stick add a little more of the paint thinner okay maybe up in this whole tree there's a big one lives there turn that brushes you're pulling us down turn it allow it to pick up all the color that's underneath there we go and we're gonna cover up most deadly you're not really looking for a lot of detail right here just some basic shapes let's go over in this one told him to be left out give him a little trunk but maybe here's one sticking out through there I can't why night there maybe it goes right I lost the canvas we don't know where it goes all right yeah I won't take it another round brush and I want to begin highlighting some of these things and really making them stand out so start off with a touch this is titanium white and then I'm gonna pick up a little bit of the phthalo blue and maybe I should say that a little stronger a little bit it's like the red it is very very strong very powerful it'll eat up all the white in the world in just a matter of a second but to tap that brush you really want to get a lot of paint in there a lot of paint okay let's go to the canvas now I want this painting to have both some cool colors in it and some nice warm colors so let's cool right up here and I'm just gonna use a top corner of the brush to begin tapping on all kinds of little things like it maybe I'll add a little more white to my color so you can see it a little better there you go there see just all kinds of little little frosty thanks hmm and if you have trouble making your paint stick I had a small amount of the liquid white so you just sort of dip it right out into a little liquid white and then go back through it and because this is a little thinner then it will stick very easily takes a very little pressure on the brush here maybe lives a happy little push this is what keeps a little rabbit warm in the winter he's got to have a place to cut 11b be cozy don't worry not hearing this cold we're gonna have snow down here then I'm going back to my other round brush and with it go into a little bit of yellow to the bright red a yellow ocher CAD yellow and then to the red okay let's go back up here now right here with this nice glow is I want to use some nice warm colors just let them sort of bounce through Jess let them bounce through add a little more Becca there see you said all those little things happen and work in the layers maybe on this tree here the lights playing through there lucky there all those little colors beautiful little things happen this is all the yellows with a little bright red now who sets our lights coming through there over here to will Sparkle these up with a little color still working in layers Indian yellow a little bit of the red just go right up here put a little bit out in here they're so round brush makes a fantastic little leaf effects for distant trees I really like it for distant trees don't want to get too much don't like it now I'm going back to my round brush that has the blue and the white on it and let's begin playing some of those colors right into it so it just looks like a light striking over there on the side every once a while I'm gonna add a little bit more of the liquid white so it sticks easy okay yeah we just sort of let these come together all the little warm colors and the cool colors are all playing together there okay let's go back over here maybe there's a happy little tree yeah we could just quickly drop on a few little things here and there think about some basic patterns just don't throw things on at random there's one right there wherever you are and you can put as many or as few in your world as you want if you want to look like they're hanging down use more of the brush and just tap downward it's also a super way if you're painting weeping willows they're beautiful trees and they're probably one of the easiest trees are to paint Oh kinds of little hang you down okay yeah well I got this old dirty brush going here I'm just gonna pull a little bit of this color just like so I begin thinking about the lay of the land out here and all we do here is just putting in some base color we're not really concerned about what it is at this point it's picking up some of those Browns and all the colors that we have in the trees pulling all that out too but it gives you a feeling of the lay of the land and it gives you a starting point something to work with okay let me find my fan brush here I'm gonna get him and let's begin putting in some details we'll go right into a titanium white I touch just a touch of the bright red okay now then you have to make some big decisions where is the snow let it begin playing pulling it across see use very little pressure and that color it's underneath shows through and it automatically will make beautiful shadows for you there's always little bumps and stuff just create all kinds of happy little things there comes one I see one right there then blend it out a little yeah just like so come right now across and you just keep going on them however many you want there's another one just layer after layer after layer let's have some fun make some big decisions and what else do we want in here maybe maybe little cabin you know me I'm I'm crazy about little cabins hmm so let's try them back to you what will we will paint the cabin let's use it let's use a big brush today we'll take the 2 inch brush pull it through the paint now I'm using the dark sienna and the Van Dyck Brown and just mix them on the brush see when you pull it wiggle it wiggle it both sides and then sharpen it just like you would or a knife I just pull it right through there and look at the sharp edge look at that it comes to a very sharp chisel edge okay let's go right up here now you got to make a big decision where's your little cabin liver maybe today we'll have a big old cabin yeah I'm gonna do the back Eve first so we just paid it off like so hello to little more paint and then we pull it straight down all we're doing here is applying a base color okay we need a other side of the house see they just pull it down and a lot of paint a lot of paint on them I want that to be very strong then another side right here straight down like that now since our light source is coming from here we want this side of the cabinet to be lighter then over here so over here be sure this side is a good and dark real dark so it stands out nice okay now same old dirty brush I'm gonna go right into a little bit of the white a little blue and just tap a little bit on the brush see just a little on the brush here do both sides and you can see it a little better maybe see there can't go back up here add it I want this to look like old weathered wood so all I'm gonna do is just start touching and letting it bounce and come right down can you see that it looks like it's old old old looks like my house okay now I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna make it darker once again I had a little black to it once again we want the side over here to be darker so load a lot of paint let's go back up there now then over here we want the same basic thing see just barely touching and let it work down so it looks a hold you're sort of touching and pushing at the same time a little bit on this side I can't come right a little house is about to fall over now then we can take the knife and work on our perspective here a little bit we'll see yeah you can just cut it off whatever you want it just like so and we need a roof on that cabin so it takes them the titanium white we use at night let's go right up here and lay in a little snow-covered that simple just let it work right down and you could take clean this edge up make it nice and smooth bet it overhang a little bit then grab it and pull there you go how easy it is to make a happy little cabin put a little snow on this side I can have at least least little touch of the phthalo blue I want to make it look like here's that edge on here they'll blue over here just a little blue with white tiniest tiniest little mountain already I tell you what let's do take the Van Dyck Brown pile without very flat cut across and get just the smallest little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife I have it right along here well just touch and make the indication of all kind of little boards whole weathered boards there we go dude do the tooth dope - and you can put as many boards and your cabin as you want put something out here then we could take our liner brush we're just a little the liquid white on it we'll put the indication of some happy little icicles hanging off here there we go there we go whew over on this side every mini whatever that gives us a little icicle this old guy he's probably he's probably we ran out of storage space I'm a junk saver so maybe he had to build him a little it lives right there here's a side cut a roof on his shed don't want him don't he sure to get full of snow it'll touch you some highlight out here very touching we need some boards on that too okay lately once again you can cut it off tell you what let's do let's just let's put in a window right here there's one Arizona looks like two big guys don't take a little bit of kid yellow I will just make the indication that maybe somebody's home the lights are on there that easy you take a little touch of the liquid black and just go right around these that easy make them stand out there we go there we know somebody's home okay let's go back to her fan brush and we can begin coming right in here bringing all this together if you pick up a little bit of that brownish color don't worry about it don't worry about it it makes beautiful shadows beautiful little shadows here all these happy little shadows just drop on me just sort of work back and forth between the warm and the cool colors just all kinds of beautiful little things happen here let me pick up a little bit of the brown and maybe here and there there lives a happy little weave here in there there yes just drop him in lift up a little bit and you can take a look on the snow color just reach out of there clean up his foots and bring them all together okay let's get crazy why not well I can take some brown and some black we'll throw in some crimson shoot even the live it up a little bit of phthalo blue we don't care long is this good and dark let me clean my knife and we'll take the two inch brush and I'm gonna go right into all that dark color just look at there pull it wiglet bring it back to a nice sharp sharp chisel ditch me that good chisel edge there it is very sharp okay let's go back up here tell you what let's do maybe their lives right there a great big evergreen tree he just goes right off the top of the canvas just use just the corner of the brush and tap as you work down the tree add more pressure tap harder and harder make those bristles Bend downward may come just bend look at that and that easy okay they don't create our happy big tree this is big tree and we can take another brush and put some white on it why a little touch of a blue there there okay let's go back up there and let's just put the indication of something a little bit of snow hanging here and there don't kill all the dark the dark is what makes us stand out just here there okay yeah there we can just begin playing with some of the nice things around here we're gonna just take a little blue and white lift upward a little bit and begin just bringing all this together see create another plane that easy that worked right I've been there just like so it sort of work it back and forth they're all right now maybe maybe take the liner brush touch of the liquid black on it but it will stick or twig here and there they're always sticking up out of the snow however many you want I'll tell you what maybe over here maybe there's a couple over in here too like so drop in a few here I think that makes a pretty nice little painting thank we'll call that one finished in fact so from all of us here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless we'll see you next time
