- Hi, welcome back. This is the last show of the
27th series, and I'm glad you're with us
today. I thought today we'd just have a
crazy day and just do a little painting. We'll just sort of see what
happens okay? Let's start out and have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along
with us. While they're doing that, let me show you this crazy thing I've got going up here today. I took a standard old
18 by 24 inch canvas, and the first thing I
did was take white gesso and an old paint roller, one of these old,
disposable paint rollers, about three inches across, And I rolled a lot of gesso on
it. And I used a paint roller so it makes all these
little designs in it. I don't know if you
can see 'em yet or not, but you will before the
painting's over. I allowed that to dry
completely. Then I took acrylic paint, I used some alizarin crimson, and some sienna and a little bit
of umber, and just took a foam brush, and here and there just
smeared a little acrylic paint. Allowed all that to dry, and then we covered the entire
canvas with a very, very thin coat of liquid clear so the canvas is
wet. The clear only makes it wet, that's the only reason we put it
on there, is to make it wet. So with that, let's just have
some fun and see what happens. Let's start today with a
little bit of Indian yellow. I like the Indian yellow
because it's very transparent. Okay, let's go up in here. And we'll just start right here. And we'll begin applying this
color. Oh, shoot, let's just put
it over the entire canvas. What the heck. Anything we don't like,
we'll just change it. But that easy, we can just begin this painting. I like doing paintings like this because they're very different, and they're unique, and they excite people. And it gives you a new
challenge in your life. If you haven't tried one of
these, you ought to try it. You know, all the
different colors of gesso and acrylic paint that
you can put together... You can make fantastic
backgrounds. And they save you a lot of
agony in your painting world. They make painting easy for you. And I have got several letters
since I've been doing this about the fact in the art world
they say that you shouldn't, maybe this is not permanent. It might only last 100 years. Acrylic under oil, there
is some controversy. I realize that. But for what we're doing
here today, we'll use that. There we are. All I'm doing is just
covering the entire canvas with just a little bit of this
yellow. Just Indian yellow. As I say, it's a transparent
yellow. Our other yellows are not
transparent. There. Just cover the entire canvas. All right, yeah, that
doesn't look bad already. Shoot. Now then... Just doing this to assure
that it's covered evenly. There we are. Now then... Now let's begin playing. That's very transparent, as
we've said several times. Now I'm gon' begin taking opaque
color. And for that, I'm gonna start with a little bit of titanium
white, and a very, very small amount. Very small amount. So you can see, it didn't
matter how you load it, but just a small amount. And let's just begin picking
out some little areas... And begin putting this
opaque color on here, very thin. Very thin, I can't say that
enough. Just enough to sort of make
it look misty in there, that's all I'm looking for, is just a little misty
appearance. I don't want to lose that nice
yellow that we have back there. Just want to create some
little effects like this. There we are. See, just let 'em go. Let 'em go. Wherever. Doesn't matter. This is, even though
this is an opaque color, it's still transparent enough that you can see the little
designs that we have right through
there. Maybe up in here. I'm just gonna sort of
bounce around on the canvas and put these in. Here and there, and there and
here. Makes no difference. You just sort of look at yours, and you decide. See? Like right here. Good place for one. And every single canvas, especially with these
backgrounds like this, every single one will
be different and unique. That's what makes this so
gorgeous, that they are different. We want 'em to be different. We don't wanna teach ya just how to copy a painting. Shoot, we wanna teach ya how to make your own
masterpiece. That's where the fun comes in. Very lightly. There. Now then, we can begin playing with some other colors in here. Maybe a little more white right
in there. Let's take, I'm gonna go into a little touch of alizarin
crimson. Very small amount. And we'll just begin with it. Just to make little areas in
here that have little splotches of
color. It's gorgeous. I like to do these type of
paintings. They're very, once again,
they're very unique. And it'll drive people crazy trying to figure out how you
made these effects happen. Shh, don't tell 'em. Don't tell 'em. Use a little bright red
once in a while, too. There we go. Reach up here, get a little
white... To make that stand out. Look it there, color just jumps out at you. But most of that is still
showing through. Something about like that. As I mentioned, this is the last
show of the 27th Joy of Painting
series. That's hard to believe that, my gosh, there's over
350 half hour shows now. It's unreal, we've been on
television for ten years. I've been producing these
shows for ten years. And in that time period, the Joy of Painting has become
the most successful art show in the history of television. And it's your fault. And I'd like to thank you very,
very much for your support... And for coming out and seeing us when we come to your town. That's fantastic. You've made an old man's dream
come true. Every artist wants to share
his painting with the world, and you've allowed me the
opportunity to do this through the miracle of
television. So thank you very much. And if you haven't got a
chance to see all the shows, call your local station. They can get 'em. There we go. Once in a while, the least little touch of pthalo
blue. The least little touch,
I don't want much blue. It's too, too strong. Just a little here and there. Little touch of the white, right in there with it. But isn't that a gorgeous
background? And it's so, so very easy to do. So easy to do. There we go. Now sometimes it's fun... Just to take and play a little
bit, and that's what we'll do. I'll tell you what, in down
here, let's take, this is alizarin
crimson and sap green mixed together to make a nice
brown color. And I wanna come in here and just do this. Just take it and pull it
straight down. Maybe we'll have a little water
in here, and this'll end up being our
water. Alizarin crimson and sap green, mixed together to make a brown
color. And you could take it to the
reddish side, or the green side, depending on your mood, or what flavor you want in your
painting. Normally I go a little
bit to the red side, but that's just my preference. Everybody's different. There we are. And we'll come back and play
with that a little later on. Now then... I'm gonna take... Make a lavender color. Then I'm gonna use a little
black, and alizarin crimson, a little bit of pthalo blue in
it. Need more crimson, there we go. And we'll mix up a little pile
here, 'cuz we're gonna use it
throughout. Gonna have some of it
that's to the red side, some to the blue. See, over here's to the red, over here's to the blue. So I have both in the
same pile, basically, so I can just sort of go back
and forth or mix 'em together. Okay. Now... As you know, if you've
painted with me before, paint thinner and liquid clear have a very unique reaction. A very unique reaction, so we're gonna use that to our
advantage. Get a little paint thinner up
here so I can thin this. Let's just play with
some thin paints today. Tell you what, that paint is very thin,
it's almost like ink. Turn the bristles in the paint and then pull 'em out so it
brings it to a very sharp edge. There, you can see it. Let's go up in here. Gotta make some big decisions. (whistling) Maybe in our world, there lives a tree right here. We'll put a little stalk in, or a little trunk, whatever
you want to call it. And let us make several. Just by pulling that. (whistling) It goes right
through there. Shoop, there's another one. You have to make some decisions. How many trees live in your
world? It's totally and completely up
to you. And you can put the
indication here and there of a few little branches that
come off. They just sort of hang
around and have a good time. Here. It don't matter if they're not
perfect. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it, 'cuz we
don't make any mistakes here. We only have some happy
accidents. There. Okay. I've got quite a few letters
asking if there's any place people can
go and see some of the paintings that we've done on TV. I really don't, I don't have a
place that I display the paintings,
I'm sorry. We just don't have that. About as close, well, our partner Anette Kowalski has
recently opened a little activity
center in New Smyrna Beach, where the public is invited
and see some of 'em. If you happen to be in that
area, stop by and say hello to her. There's a lot of my paintings
there, and some of hers, and some of our instructors. You know, it's a good place just to go and look at paintings. Okay, look here. Take just a little liner
with a little paint on it... And get nervous. Just get nervous. See there? Just let that sort of flow. Just make it very loose. We're doin' a very loose
little painting today. There. You don't have to really worry
about this. Just play, have fun. Have fun. I mentioned earlier in one of
the shows that I got a letter from
somebody one time that said they had a
little shake in their hand, and because of that they
couldn't paint. Well this is your painting,
right here. This is it. If you've ever had any problem
at all because of a little shake in
your hand, this one is designed just for
you. Something about like that. Just a few little bushes and
things that live down here at his foot. And I'm just using a script
liner brush sidewards. There. Paint's very thin, so it just slides right over
that clear. Just slides right over it. If it doesn't slide,
add more paint thinner. Just keep adding paint thinner. And by changing the angle, you can create all types of
effects. There we go. All kinds of little things that just live back
here in the background. Let your imagination take you wherever you wanna go. 'Cuz you really don't have
to do a lot of painting... The undercoating, under-color that was under here takes
care of most of that. Shoop, I want another tree
there. Maybe there's some little
arms hangin' off him. There. And then in here, maybe
there's a limb or two. Who knows? Little branch or something that's got a few leaves
left on it down here. That's a scraggly old tree. I like old trees that have
character. Shoot. There. Something like that. All right. Wherever. Wherever. Just bounce these in. You could use a fan brush and do
this. I just want to sort of show you how much you could do with a little liner brush. Just a plain, ordinary little
liner brush. It's a lot of fun. A great deal of fun. Maybe there's a few little
things that grow out here. But be loose, this is
a very loose painting. Very loose. Maybe even a few little things
out here with some limbs on them like
this. Just make indications. And... Now the brush is almost empty. I just wanna rub it so... It picks up on the high
points of that gesso that's underneath. Just picking up on the high
points. Very little paint on the brush. Very little. You'd be shocked at what
a small amount of paint it takes to do this. There. And just creep all kinds of
illusions. And painting is nothing
but games of illusion. That's all it is. See there? Fan brush would be a little bit
faster... But I like using this today. There we are. Begin thinking maybe the lay of, if this is gonna be water, we want this to sort of tilt
down, because water normally always
lays in a little recessed area. It won't climb up on a
rock and look pretty for ya just to make you happy. Water is lazy, it's like me. It always looks for the
easiest place to go, which is normally the bottom of
the hill. So we need to paint in a little
hill... So it can run down. There. Something like so. Now I'm goin' in to a
little bit of that brown that I made from sap green
and alizarin crimson. And we'll drop in a few little
things in here with that, too. Very loose. Very loose. I like these, 'cuz
there's no mistakes here. Absolutely no mistakes. Just fun painting. All right. But just let if barely graze the
canvas. That's the reason I
went to all the trouble to put the gesso on, so it has all those high points
on there. All right, maybe on this side
over here... (whistling) There you go. Just make a little noise, drop in a little tree. Something like that, give him a
friend. And here we are. Just another little limb. Stick, twig, whatever you want
to call it. There. Just like that. All right. See? There they are. Wherever you want 'em. Just drop them in. There. Maybe this comes right on down. I don't know, right on down
through here somewhere. Same basic idea. Put all of those little things
in. Take a little more of the color. (grunting) Gotta make those noises. This is an old tree,
he's had a rough life. Has he had a rough life. Look at that. These are all gorgeous colors. They're transparent, and they work wonderfully. Watch here. I keep talkin' about using a fan
brush, let me show you how to do it. Thin color, the color that was
very thin. And I wanna put a little
more, too on there, just in case some of them show
through. There. Now we know
there's a limb on there. Take the fan brush and just, just do like that. See? While you're doin' it, just let
it, just go back and forth, and then touch the canvas with
it like you're really nervous. Really nervous. And all all these little
effects will just, they'll happen for ya. They'll happen, believe me. Try it. Try it. Yeah, there. Just wherever you want 'em to
be. Down in here you're
gonna do the same things. That's how you could use a fan
brush, I just wanted to show you how
you could use a liner brush, any old thing that turns you on. There we go. And that easy, you can create the illusion
of a beautiful little place. Little more color here. There. That looks like a little place,
maybe, where the water runs. Good idea. Sometimes these little things
just happen. There we go. And those are called happy
accidents. We look for those. We save 'em, cherish 'em. They're our good friends. I'm gonna add a little
bright red, here and there. Here and there. I'm gonna pick up a little
yellow ochre. Cad yellow. Just some of the yellows here
and there. Just begin popping in a few
little, a few little highlights, same
way, though. And the paint is quite thin, I have a lot of paint
thinner on the brush. I want it to work with that
liquid clear that's under there. Something like that. See, all those little effects
happen. There's a lot of depth in there, you haven't done hardly anything except just bounce the brush
around. That's all. Now then we take some
of that same color... Let's begin to play here. Let's decide maybe this is
water. Pull it down. This paint is still thin. I've thinned it with a
little bit of paint thinner. Just pull it straight down like
that. Shoop, shoop, shoop. All the way across. And with a clean, dry brush, very gently go across. Just like we're making
reflections normally. That's all. Now if you want to have some
fun, let me dip that brush
into a little thinner and shake most of it out. I've left a tiny little bit in
it. Tiny little bit. And you just go across there. And if there's just enough in
there, it'll make little openings come
in clear. Might not be able to see 'em
yet, amd it takes a little
while for them to work, but they'll come in there. They're not showing up very
well. Let's use the liner brush, see
'em? It reacts with the... It reacts with the liquid clear
there. And these little things
just sort of happen. It's a nice way of making what looks like little
shine across the water. And it's done by removing paint. There we go. Okay. I'm gonna take, I'm gonna
take... I'll use some black, and
some of that brown we made, from that sap green, alizarin
crimson mixed together. Okay, and I'm gonna go over
here and get paint thinner. I wanna thin that down. Very thin. Get some paint thinner, thin it
down. We want it quite thin. Wipe off the knife. Then I'll take some titanium
white, and just some black. I'm gonna mix it together
to make a grey color. Like so. Thin it down. Thin it down. Just adding paint
thinner and mixing it up. That's really all it amounts to. All right. So we have a much thinner paint. Take our little filbert brush... And we'll take it through the
dark. And if you've painted with me
for a while, you know what we're gonna do. We're gonna make some little
rocks. Stay right there, and I'll come
to you. Now see, take the other side, so we have light on one
side, dark on the other. And let's go up in here. And then we can begin figuring
out where all these little
rocks and stones live. Maybe there's a lot of them in
our world. There they come. See? Just drop 'em in. Very, very simple way of making
these, and it's very effective. There. Maybe some live right
out here on the water, I don't know. Here's a big one. I saw him, right there. Right there, big ol' rascal. And here's some that maybe
go right off the canvas. They don't stop just
because the canvas did. And we have a lot of time, you can pull down a little
reflection under each one. And that's really what you want
to do. Just each one, pull down
a little reflection. Grab it with a big brush, or any brush, and then go gently across. It'll make it look like, make it look like there's a
little reflection in the water. Take our liner brush. I'm gonna use just a light
color. A little bit lighter than what's
there. Just go in and, I know you can't hardly see
that, I don't want it very bright. Just here and there, put in
a few little water lines. But this is a very neat little
painting. Its sort of different
than anything we've done. But I hope you enjoyed doing
little paintings like this. I try to show you as many
things as I possibly can, as many different ideas as
possible. You pick out the ones you want, and you like, and use 'em. And do gorgeous paintings for
me. And really, if you have time, send me a photograph of what
you're doing. It's so fantastic to show on the
air here once in a while, paintings that people all
over the country are doing. Beautiful paintings. Paintings that people never
believed were possible. And if they can do 'em, you can
do 'em. We have young people in their
90s that are doing there first
painting. And it's working, and it makes them happy. And if painting does anything
for you, it should make you feel
good in your heart. I tell you what, I think
that one's about ready for old signature. Take a little red... And we'll just put in a
quick little signature right here over our rock. And I really hope you've enjoyed
this one. If you'll try it, you'll find that it's one
of the most fantastic ways of painting that you've ever
seen. Take your time and play with these. You know, here we've done
most of this painting using nothing but a liner brush, a fan brush, and a filbert
brush. Well, I did use a two inch brush just to put the background in, but you could do it with
anything. And this little painting, when you show it to friends and
neighbors, they're not gonna
believe that you done it. Over and over again I
get letters from people and they say, "My friends took, "and they looked here, and
they tried to find the numbers "that were behind the painting." Enjoy painting. It does wonderful things for
you. It makes beautiful gifts for everybody that you love and who loves you. And you know I would like
to take just a second and thank you. In the last series I happened to
mention that I had lost my wife. I have received hundreds
and hundreds of cards from people all over the country expressing their sympathy and
support. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing in my
grief, and for making my wife
a very special person in your life, too. On behalf of Walt and Anette
Kowalski, everybody here at the station, I'd like to wish each and every
one of you happy painting, God bless, and I'll see you next series. Until then, take care of
yourself. (mellow soft rock music)
