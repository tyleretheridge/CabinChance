hey welcome back it's a fantastic day and I'm certainly glad you could join me today so I tell you what let's start out today having run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and they'll come across as usual in the same orders I have them on the palette starting with white and working around I have mold standard 18 by 24 inch canvas up here it's covered with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white and it's all ready to go so let's just do a beautiful little scene today that'll make you happy and it's such a wonderful day let's just have some fun too then we'll start out here with a little dark Sienna a little dark Sienna be right back I'm gonna reach down here grab a little touch of the yellow ocher so we have dark sienna and yellow ochre just a little bit and let's just start up here in the sky let's just let's just start going around making little crisscross strokes just little X's like so I let it blend outward outward outward there we are just nice happy little sky warm colors today we're just going to make beautiful warm little painting there tea now I'm going to take same old color dark Sienna reach down here in grab little yellow ocher reach over here and I will put at least little touch of SAP green into it so we have yellow ochre SAP green and dark Sienna little more the SAP green ooh that's nice beautiful color and we'll just begin laying that right around like so still making the little little crisscross strokes X's okay little more of the color and we'll just bring it all the way out like so okay in same thing on the other side a little more the dark Sienna a yellow ochre and SAP green just load both sides of the brush jump right up here and we'll just fill that right in and when you're using a big old 2 inch brush it only takes a second here - to cover the whole canvas that easy now we'll just sort of blend it all together go over the entire canvas let me sort of take a look see and see what we have there very nice now then I've got several whole brushes going here so I don't have to spend all my time washing them I want to take a little titanium white on another on another 2 inch brush and maybe up in here there's a light spot we'll just take that brush and work around and you can do this as many times as you want to achieve a desired lightness and we just blend it all together and it look like maybe this is where the Sun is here behind a cloud there far away it just gives us sort of a little light source right there and from that we could work around see tape jute Issel two-inch brush is so much fun let's go right back into our dark sienna be right back get a little more of that yellow ocher travel over here get a little SAP green put them all together maybe a little more than green here we are now then let's begin making the indication of some little trees that live way back here in the distance so let's just take the brush and hold it up here like this touch give a little side words push see there and the other side push it makes it look like happy little tree out there and you can make two or three little trees wherever you want now at the same time we can use the same color and just tap use just the top corner of the brush and we can just tap and make the indication of all kinds of little trees that are we back in the distance far away we're not looking for a lot of detail here it's too far away at this point later on we'll begin laying in detail right now all we're looking for is distance shapes okay makes up a little warmer color and we're just mixing these colors on the brush maybe right in here there lives another happy little tree same thing we still are using dark cm yellow ocher and a little SAP green in it but that easy you can make beautiful beautiful background trees just using a big ol two inch brush so often we avoid this brush because it's because it's big that son of a gun will do fantastic things for you give it a chance try it you'll like it one more maybe right over here there we go Neda I want this painting today to be extremely misty just very soft and a lot of miss Becker so we'll take a clean dry brush all I'm going to do is firmly you can probably hear how hard I'm hitting I'm going to just firmly tap this I want to diffuse the bottom of it totally away just totally soften it until you can't even tell where it stops or starts there we go just like so all right and then let's have several different planes in this painting so let's let's begin moving forward I think today we'll use some I'll take some bright red what the heck be brave be brave take a chance experiment enjoy that's what makes it fun little white bright red they look blue we need a little more red in there oh that's nice that's nice this is going to make sort of a lavender color sort of a blueish lavender is what I'm looking for little more the white hmmm that's pretty already okay now then we grab a fan brush think I'll use a fan brush today let's just load a little color just go back and forth with the fan brush just get a little bit of color down or reach over here and get a little more white on it a little bit lighter right oh it's nice there now that I want to take just the corner of the fan brush and just scrub it all we're doing is the corner just the corner just just sort of rub it give it a little push all there is to it and begin thinking about some basic shapes here of some bushes and trees and all kinds of little things there as things get closer to you in the landscape they should get darker darker and value there we go see just all kinds of little happy things are going on back in here all right layer after layer after layer and that's what gives your painting depth that's what that's what will make your painting special is that it has depth and distance in it it's not just old flat painting Kate and I would take a 2 inch brush and tap the base of that only the base that we don't want to mess up those beautiful tops and once again that will help create that illusion of mist and the mist is your separator it separates each plane and each layer that's what we're looking for treasure that mist it's very very important to you it's a good friend take care of it treated we'll treat it like you treat any good friend with respect care about it there we are other little bush maybe lives right here and you can sort of vary these colors a little bit between the bright red and the blue and the white so you have all different things happening and just sort of figure out where you think these little bushes live drop them in just layer after layer after layer a little more paint shoot maybe look right here maybe there's a little tree it's a poor little tree he scrawny scrawny little tree that's that's my word for today from the south I live in Florida now I like those some of those little sayings that we have there this is a scrawny tree maybe open here there's some little bushes that just sort of fade back there okay now once again back to this little two-inch brush and we're going to tap won't keep that distance very important give it a little upward lift now then and it's time to start having fun enough for that easy stuff let's let's get in here and do it now same old color maybe we'll add a touch of blue to it I want to be a little bit more to the bluish side all right let's go right up here maybe in our world their lives boy there does now a nice tree he lives right here just looks out and sees the whole world and I wouldn't do it is tapping with a firm with a firm pressure with a fan brush there we are maybe he's got a friend yes he does there he is you know me I think everybody ought to have a friend everybody were to have a friend let's put some indication out here just a little some little leaves and stuff that are just silhouetted out here we're not looking for a lot of details too far away yet there we are few on this one they're just sort of decide where you want to drop them in shoot Oh is so much fun I tell you what maybe right here just sort of look at your painting make a decision whoo that was crooked like that I don't like a little straight trees there they just look like future telephone poles I like trees with character and we'll give him a friend too there now maybe right down here we'll just take the corner that brush and scrub it again just to make the indication of some more little things that are happening but all you're using just a corner of the fan brush and just rub it just rub it's like you're making waves in the ocean almost same basic idea if you painted seascapes with me using the fan brush then you know exactly what I'm saying here you can do it Matt in tap the base of that really get in there tap there see how misty that looks look at all the different planes in here already just one after another goes all the way up can't tell you I like these trees let's put another one in here right about him there shoot put a few little leaves on him I don't want to overdo these cuz it will kill all the background I want to keep that background I like that maybe out here we need a feel don't want this old tree left out he'll get you'll get angry and run off and leave you there okay this one here hmm I like these kind of paintings are so soft it's so nice they just make you feel good okay now then let's take our liner brush I'll dip it in paint thinner paint thinner and go right through some of that same color we were using Jane look me up in here just look around the scene maybe there's a whale more - that's hanging off here here and there wherever you want them wherever little squirrels got to have a place to sit eat the pinecone that he finds out here kind of think about them just make up little stories about the little creatures that live out in here and then there's a reason for all this makes it so much easier there mmm just more and more where ever these little things are always hanging off the old trees especially if they're evergreen type trees of some kind so always a lot of them out there okay yeah just using a little bit of brown on the liner brush and go back in here and here and there drop in an indication of a few little trunks that are showing back between these wherever you want them maybe you can see a indication there okay that gives us a basic idea of how to put in a whole bunch of little twigs and sticks um all kinds of happy little things alright let's go up here and get a little of the Van Dyck Brown like so put some SAP green and the lizard crimson in there those two colors mixed together make a beautiful reddish brown there we are now then maybe in here oh it's not a beautiful color see maybe in here there's more little bushes and stuff that they just go right on over where do we want what everyone there we go just wherever make a decision drop them in maybe this comes right up here under these big trees you run out of paint on one side the brush turn it over use the other side that's reasonably put two sides on a brush so you can paint with both of them okay here and there we can hit a touch of a titanium white just to change the flavor of it a little same color we're just changing the flavor the lighter a little darker here and there so look at it and make a decision we're here ever a little more into the crimson side no I like these kind little paintings they are really very very pretty back to the white I'm not cleaning the brush I'm just very in color right on the same little dirty brush there we go okay let's get crazy find the big brush here that little rascals too slow hummel go right into a little Van Dyck Brown let's just put some color on the canvas right along like so I know you're saying Bob you have certainly certainly done it this time you may be right - let's just see I know all this needs to be dark because I want to put a lot of nice things in here that need a dark base so we could just paint all this dark let the heck there that's a lot easier than worrying about it just throw it in good and dark all right yeah then let's take a little brown on the knife here maybe there's a little little heal over here we just take the knife just sort of let it flow right down like that right on out we'll put some rocks and some stones and all kinds of little things over here there they are just wherever you want them wherever quema take some light little dark sienna just mix it up like so put some black in there too nice leave it color marbled like that cut off a small roll of paint so you have a little roll right out there let's go right in here and just drop in the indication here and there some little highlights that they've read along in there so you get all those variations because you didn't over mix you paint if you over mix the paint did you just end up with one flat old dead color and we like paintings that have a little life and on the shoot a little happy paintings happy pings if you want sad things watch the news all right I'm just going to go right in here and just pop in some pop in some little get a little color on the brush here few little things that work right down Thanks so use a little small knife and we can create the illusion of some nice strong rock sir put a dark edge under there I think but all these little things are just happening maybe maybe right out in here shoot maybe we got all kind of stones right out here just wherever you want just nice rocks and stones I know you're saying I don't look like rocks and stones to me all right dozen to me don't you mention let's cover them up so to cover them up take another fan brush I'm going to dip it into liquid white and then go into titanium white we right back get a little tiny tiny bit of the phthalo blue but there's a lot of color on the brush I put the titanium white in there only to thin it kid let's go back up here now maybe these rocks live down here put underneath there underneath maybe maybe just just a happy little waterfall maybe it lives yep right there right about it they're saying it hits down hearing those little splashes going on there tiniest little bit of blue though not much and you let all kinds of little things go on maybe there's little stones in there and you can just have little splashy doers here and there wherever as many or as few as you want now we can grab this I want to pull this down straight down go across just like we were making a reflection because that's what we want it to look like how here they come right along in here we can decide where all these little pools are see they're discrete all kinds of little illusions there we are hmm it's a super super nice and easy way to make a happy little waterfall there we go okay let's get over here shoes I'm gonna take some more this Van Dyck Brown maybe over here let's come right down in here maybe there's a big big projection or big rock it lives the other yes he hangs out over here big stone maybe tail it maybe another one here just wherever you are just sort of look at your painting make a big decision there just drop it in drop it in where everyone okay final fan brush there's one would take some of the brown and some of the white and just mix it together on right on the fan brush maybe over in here some little bushes live out here on on this projection there they come do you knew they were there there they go right on up we're still using just the corner of the fan brush and I just want to show you how you can use just the corner and make the illusion of all kinds of little bushes and stuff that they've out here yeah okay take the knife we use a little bit of this highlight color it's just brown and white come right out here let's put a top on this big rock so you by putting the top on it look at there some again just jumps right out at you pull that downward allow it to grab just the least little touch of that color and pull downward maybe this one here maybe it comes right out here it's up to you it's up to you we're over you want it oh I shall feel the clean brush come into a little white little brown this painting is done almost totally in Browns that's what makes it so very nice just very nice little painting there we're okay right along in there to you what well we got all this Brown good maybe there's just an indication of a little path comes right along right on out of the painting there right on around the corner we don't know where that rascal goes a little touch of white on it so it stands out a little bit I wanted to be very subdued though very quiet okay maybe over in here we can put the indication of some little bushes and stuff that live here on the side of that path we can even get crazy and ever maybe there's a big old stone or two it lives in here and there each side little touch a highlight on it see there okay few more little bushes there and in yours you just put anything that you want wherever you want okay shoot let's get crazy and we'll go right into straight Van Dyke Brown a lot of paint on the brush maybe in our world their lives right here a huge tree big strong tree there we go if I go to the side you can see him a little better he lives right out here and maybe he had a friend oh he lived right here maybe he fell over maybe he took the week off just fell over in the stream there somewhere okay yeah we'll take a fan brush that has light color on it and we just take titanium white go right along this edge sit to just just bang it on there right out here on the stump like so now take the brush grab it give it a little tiny little pull see it's all there is to it just give it a little pull so I told you not to worry about it there makes a beautiful tree and take some verb Brown maybe there's a lien or two lives out here wherever you think they should be just hearing their okay maybe let's have one over here I don't want this side left down here's another one big old son of a gun and he's got a little friend I didn't this a fantastic way using basically just a fan brush a knife a couple little pieces of equipment to make a super little painting maybe his went off mmm crooked would you know me I'm like he's old crooked trees there he is that's really lives back to our white come right along the edge grab it pull it over pull it over see that makes that tree look look around little paint thinner on the liner brush we want this paint to be thin like ink and let's go in here put in a little more to wherever maybe over here on this old stuff are still a little more - hey you know there we go just all kinds of little things there and we need a few leaves on this one and this old painting will be about done there we go not too many not too many maybe there's a little one goes right on off the canvas there and shoot a few finishing touches and in yours you put a few sticks and twigs and limbs wherever you want them that brings it all together and makes it interesting I think they're that ready for a signature take a little the paint thinner a little bright red well sign this one right over here hope you've enjoyed this one it's sort of different it'll certainly certainly give you a little challenge so try this one let me know how it works drop me a line okay from all of us here happy painting and God bless you
