- Hi, I'm certainly glad
you could join me today because it's a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you're at. Tell you what, let's just do a beautiful little painting today. Every day's sort of crazy around here, so I thought today we'd
start with something a little different. So I tell you what, let's have 'em run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us. While they're doing that let me tell you what I already done up here. I've taken a piece of contact paper and put it on my standard old
18 by 24 inch canvas here, and I've cut two ovals out of it. And then I've coated the
inside of these two ovals with a mixture of liquid
white and liquid black, so I guess you'd call it liquid grey. And we just put a nice thin, even coat and it's all ready to go. The rest of this is just decoration, because it's getting a little crazy here. So I thought we'd have some fun today. Let's take a little bit
of the midnight black, we'll use the old two inch brush, midnight black, little of the, oh, we'll do some dark sienna, reach over here, I'll get
a little alizarin crimson. Just mix 'em together, like so. Black, dark sienna, little alizarin crimson, very dark color though. Very dark color. Alright, maybe today we'll do a scene that's deep in the woods here. I don't know, let's just
start off and have some fun. Let's just take and begin
putting in the indication of all kinds of little shapes. And we'll just start off tapping in some very basic little shapes and
sort of see what happens. Just see what happens. Now I made this grey mixture today because I want this to be very subdued. And this grey will mix with
everything that we put on there and it'll cause that to
happen automatically. And if there's any of
this grey showing through then it'll look just right. There. Just begin laying in all
kinds of little shapes. And right now all we're looking for is just some basic ideas. We're not looking for a lot of detail. We'll come back and look at what we have and then we'll begin picking out each individual little thing. Right now all we're doing basically is blocking in some ideas. So we have the midnight
black, dark sienna, a little alizarin crimson, maybe right here, what the heck. We'll have some here too. Just let these things
run right on through. There. Now when you're playing at home try this liquid grey, as I call it, it'll make some beautiful effects for you. Mix these mediums together. We have the clear, the black, the white, mix 'em together. You won't believe some of the effects. Personally, I like to take
a little of the liquid white and clear and put it together. And it gives the white, oh,
it gives it a little bit of transparence. Sometimes that comes in very handy for creating certain effects
and certain illusions. There we go. Okay, a little bit more of the black and the crimson. There. But see you can begin
finding little shapes in here and all we're using is just the corner of the two inch brush. But these little shapes will, they'll just sort of begin to appear. It's real easy. It's one of the nicest ways to sort of just lay out a little painting. There. Okay, now let's take our liner brush, we'll dip it in some paint thinner, and we'll go right into some of the brown, a little Van Dyke brown is fine. Make this paint very thin, turn it, bring the bristles to a nice, sharp point. See how sharp that is? We like paint in there. Now then we can go up here and begin picking out
little individual things. If you have trouble making the paint flow off your liner brush then add more paint thinner. It's all you have to do. Keep the paint very thin, very loose, and it'll just slide right off your brush. See, and we can just put the indication of all kinds of little things. In some of these light areas, these little holes here, there you just put the indication of a few little sticks and twigs that are showing through. There. See, maybe right in here, we don't know. We'll separate all this with highlights, we're gonna come back in put all kinds of little highlights. Right now all we're interested in is just creating the illusion of a lot of little things happening in here. Okay, let's do that also
over here on the other side. We'll need something
going on over here too. There, maybe there's a tree there too, we don't know. Wherever, wherever. There. See, maybe back in here. All kinds of little doers. There, and then you say, say there's one there. There he goes, right on up. Just sort of let your imagination just take you astray here. There we go. Maybe right in here. But see, just by putting
these little sticks in here you begin making out
little individual things that easy. And it'll just happen
for you automatically. Practice this a little
bit and you'll be amazed at what you can do by just
throwing some color on a canvas. Alright. Wash the old brush. And we'll just wipe it
off on a paper towel. And I'll just use the
same little dirty brush since I have it going here. Let's take a little bit of the yellow, a little yellow, reach up here, grab a little black, we put that in there and that'll make a beautiful green color. There, tap it a little bit. That get's that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the bristles. Okay. Now then, let's go up in here and begin picking up all these little individual things. Maybe back in here lives a happy tree right there. Just think about form
and shape for this tree. And just begin dropping him out. There. See there? There he is. We knew he was there, didn't we? Yeah. And maybe add a little of the yellow ochre and Indian yellow,
maybe way back in there, oh, there he is, there's another little rascal. Boy, my little squirrel would love to live back in here. There's so many things happening. There. So you just, just sort of
look at these things though and drop 'em in. And all we're doing is just
using the corner of the brush. It's really all we have going here, just the corner of the brush. But think about individuals. Let's add a little touch of
the bright red here and there. There, oh, that's nice. I've probably painted 25,
30 thousand paintings now and I still get excited
every time I see this work. It's fascinating. There we go. Are you beginning to see
all these little things? Isn't that exciting that
it happens that easy? Shoot. That's the joy of painting. That truly is the joy of painting, when you get to the point
that you have no fear. Let's go over on the other oval
over on the other side here. We don't want him left out. See there, there's another little tree, little bush. Little Indian yellow maybe and a little touch of the bright red, put a little sparkler way back there. See, just by varying
color and shape and form you can create all kinds of things. All kinds of things. There. I like these little paintings. They make you feel good inside and that's what life's all about. Makes you happy. There. See, layer after layer. This layering effect is
what causes it to have depth and distance and keeps it from being just a flat old piece of canvas. There's dimension in there just because of the layers. I'm gonna dip the brush
into the least little touch of liquid white, just
the least little touch. There. Okay. And we can come back in here and drop in all kinds of little rascals, there's another. There. But see how, see how nice that grey works back in there for you? It's really a fantastic way to paint. Maybe I'll put another one right here. See, you just keep seeing things and you just add more and more. There. Boy, I bet there's a mosquito or two that lives back in there. That's a beautiful place. But you know what? You know me, I think there oughta be, maybe let's have, let's have, I see something happening right here. Let's take a little liquid white, a little bit of the, little
bit of the titanium white, I'll be right back, don't go away, and a little touch of the phthalo blue. Little touch. Okay, we have a very
light blue on there now. Let's go right up in here. And maybe in our world, look right here, watch,
watch, watch, watch. Maybe there's a little bit of water just plays along and blip, falls over. See, just let it, blip. Gotta make that little noise. Maybe it just spills
right along like that. Comes right outta there, blip, there it fell again. Son of a gun, blip. Look at that, see, just blip, and splash when it hits. Push upward to make that splashy effect. And we have a happy little stream that's just running right outta there. That easy. Where is it gonna go? Now we have to start making
some big decisions here. Tell you what, let's just take a, we'll grab a one inch brush here, and we'll take a little
touch of sap green. I'm just gonna throw it right there. I wanna reflect all these nice colors right into the water. Put a little sap green there. Maybe, maybe a little yellow ochre. Oh, that's pretty. There. Maybe even a little touch of white right through there. And there, a little bright spot. Maybe back to some green. This is just sap green
on a one inch brush. I'm pulling it straight down. Straight down. This'll let that blend together. Let's go over on the other side over here. Over in here maybe we'll
have a little more of that. Shoot, that looks good. That looks good enough to eat. A little yellow ochre right in there. Maybe, maybe, maybe a little more green. I don't know, but you can just put all
kinds of beautiful colors right in here like this. Now then, we get a clean two inch brush and I wanna grab that firmly and pull it down. Very firm. Grab it and pull down. Straight down, like so. And then across. See that, makes it look like
reflections in the water. There. Now then, let's go back to
our little fan brush here. Maybe this water comes right on down here, bounces around, and just begins to play and have fun. Shoot, we don't know where it goes. Just make all kinds of beautiful effects. You know what we need? Let's have some little
stones that live out here. For that let me get out
a little liquid white and we'll put that right up here, like so. And I'm gonna add a little
bit of dark sienna to that, maybe even a little yellow ochre. Just make a very nice, warm
little light brown color. Okay. Now then, we'll take our, let's use the old filbert brush, we'll go right into, we'll go right into a little dark sienna and Van Dyke brown mixed together. Okay, now then, both sides of the brush, now right here we'll take one side and go through this thin
color that we've made, see? It's brown on one side,
light on the other. And maybe up in here in our world maybe there's just all
kinds of little stones. Look at that, see 'em? Just all kinds of happy little stones live up in here. And you can make as many or as few as you want in your world. There's another one. These are just everywhere. They live right here in this brush. Maybe they come right over here. Just all kinds of 'em. All kinds of 'em. Maybe there's a big one here. Great old big one. Maybe, more paint,
maybe, maybe right here. Just sort of make up your mind where you think they should live and drop 'em in. There's some. But make 'em all different sizes. Some are big, some are small. They're like people. I'm gonna grab the bottom of these and pull 'em down just a little bit, just the bottom, and
then go lightly across. That'll create a little
reflection in the water. Just a little reflection. There. See there? Now then, we'll take our fan brush, and it has liquid white
mixed with titanium white with a least little touch
of the phthalo blue in it. There. Okay, a lot of paint on the bristles. Now then, we'll come right
in here with this color and let's just begin
to wrap a little water right around these rocks. That'll set them right
down into the painting, brings everything together. See there? Now let's go over to the other side here. Maybe, here it comes, right on through, a little water right there. And our world, maybe this
water's coming along here and all of a sudden,
swoop, falls over again. See there? You can drop that water over
as many times as you want. Maybe, maybe there's a stone
that lives right there. You can have as many
little rocks and stuff. Maybe there's another one down here at the bottom of this little waterfall. It's up to you. Bring that water right there, and that pushes that stone right into it. Comes down, falls over. And we'll have a few little splashes down here where it hits. There. See? It's a nice way to make a very effective, beautiful little scene. There we go. Now then. That's a nice place to
catch that little trout that lives in there. Now we can take our paint thinner, little bit of the brown,
thin it down very thin, and let's go back in here and put the indication here and there of a few more sticks and twigs and little things that are
growing all out through here. There. These little details are what makes your painting so special. There we go. See? A few of 'em growing out
between those rocks there. Alright. Now maybe down here in the foreground, maybe there's some stuff over here, so for that let's go back into our black, little dark sienna, little
bit of the alizarin crimson, we'll just mix these on the brush. Tap a little bit of color
right into the bristles, tap firmly. Alright, let's go up in here and let's decide where
little things live over here. There they are, there's a happy bush and he lives right there, like so. Get a little more color. And he's got a little friend here. There. Okay, good. These are so much fun to make and by putting some bushes
here in the foreground that pushes everything back. See how far back this all went? Pushed that little
waterfall way back in there. There. Maybe a few little things right in here. And we can take our
knife and just go in here and scratch in the indication
of a stick and a twig. There. Now, we'll just use that same old brush, I'm lazy. It's got color all over
it, but that's alright. We'll go right into the yellows here and the, let's see, we've got cad yellow, yellow ochre, a little
of the Indian yellow. Here and there we're gonna
touch a little bright red. Just like so. Okay, now then, let's go up here and put some highlights on this old bush. There. There he is. Just use the corner of a brush though. And make all these
little individual things. Little individual things. Little for this one. There. Maybe we'll touch a little red right here. Oh, that's nice, that's nice. Be careful with that red though. Too much of it's distracting and almost invariably your
eye will go to that red place. Almost can't help but look there. So don't get too much, can get too distracting
on you very rapidly. Maybe right here. There. Okay, maybe a little sap green, little black here, there we go. Over on this side maybe we'll put a few little leaves and stuff out here. There he is. Just all kinds of little things. Now you can make these as
bright as you want 'em, or you can make 'em subdued. Either way. I like 'em a little more subdued today, but maybe a week from now we'd like to have 'em
nice and bright again. It's up to you. And your mood changes continually. And when your mood changes
your painting will change. It's almost something you can't help, it just sort of happens. Now I wanna take my
little liner brush here and I'm gonna take a little bit of paint that's almost white, very thin, and here and there put in a few little white trunks back here. You always have some of those in the woods and they stand out very
good against all this dark. They just sort of make it interesting. There. Just here and there. Okay, maybe a couple on the other side. And we can just have some fun. Alright, I'll tell you what let's do, I think we're to a point where we can take the contact paper off and let's see what we have. So we just grab it, give it a pull, and there we go, we have
two very nice ovals. Now we can really get crazy. Let's take, we'll go right
back to our original color, and I know I'm gonna get
a letter or two or 100 that say I like that
painting just the way it was and you went and messed it up. But when you do yours if this
is where you want it to stop then that's exactly the place to stop it. I wanna just show you what you
can do with it here though. Let's go right out here into this area and let's just let these bushes and stuff continue a little bit, let's see what happens. Just let 'em continue a little. Just sort of blend 'em right
into the ones that you have and there they go. There. Now, let's go back, let me put just a touch of
the liquid white on my brush. The liquid white is there
only to thin the color. Only to thin it. And we'll take a little of our color, oh, that's nice, tap the bristles, tap 'em into the color. Alright. Now then, let's put a few
little highlights up in here. All kinds of little
things that are happening, just like so. There. You know, it's almost unreal to me with the completion of this series there will be over 230
Joy of Painting shows. It's a lot of shows, almost unreal to me. And I hope you've had the opportunity to see 'em all if you want to. If you haven't, give your station a call. They're donated to 'em free, so they can pick 'em up. Just let 'em know that you want 'em. 'Cause if you don't let 'em know they don't know what you like and they like to hear from you. Tell you what, maybe down here there's a little bit of dirt. I'm gonna take some Van Dyke brown, let's go right in here. Let's put a little brown in here. There. Something about like so, I don't know, whatever you want. Let it go on out here. Take a little brown, a little
white, mix it together, make us a little highlight on the knife. Just barely touching. Just let it graze. Barely touching. Barely touching. Now then, we'll take a fan brush, put a little bit of our yellows and greens and all those different colors on it, and let's go up in here and we'll just pop in just a few little happy grassy areas right along in here. Wherever you think they should be. There we go. See there? That creates a lot of
depth in your painting, a lot of depth. There. Oh, I see something nice. And you know what we oughta do, we got a minute or so left here, let's have some fun. I always get in trouble
right at the end of the show. Let's take a fan brush and
fill it full of Van Dyke brown, put a lot of color, and maybe a little dark sienna too. A lot of paint, lot of paint in there. And maybe in our world there lives, are you brave? This is your bravery test for today. There lives, yep, you guessed it, a big old tree that lives right there. Big old tree. But he's a happy tree, so it's alright. Maybe he's got a friend that comes right down like that. There. I know I'm gonna get some
letters about this now. Gonna get in trouble about this. There we go. Now then, let's take, let's take, here's a little titanium white, pull it out flat, cut across, and let's go up here, barely touch, just let it barely touch. Maybe this is just a big old birch tree that lives right up here. Barely touch. Pull it. Maybe there's a little
on the other side too. Just like so, there. See there? Now let's do some on the other side. There. But when you're pulling
this pull it sort of around. And all you're doing is
barely touching the canvas, don't wanna put too much pressure on it. Barely, barely graze it. There. Now then, let's go in here with our, we'll use the old liner brush, paint thinner, and we'll put in a few
limbs on this big old, big old tree here. Maybe there's one right here, comes right out, right over like that. There. Okay, we'll give him another one there. Wherever you want 'em. Just wherever you want 'em. Put a few right in there, like so. There we go. We don't have to do too many. I'll put a few leaves on here, but just enough so you
can see the indication of some here and there. Okay, we can take our
brush with the dark color, go back, tap in a few
little things, like so. And we'll highlight those a little. There. Okay, a little bit of the yellow, and let's come back in here and just put a few highlights on that. I hope you've enjoyed this one. It's a very nice little painting, give you a lot of practice, and it'll make you happy inside. The old clock on the wall tells me that it's time to go, so we'll, think we'll call it a day. We'll call this one finished. From all of us, happy
painting and God bless. (gentle music)
