hi welcome back I'm glad you could join me today you ready to do a fantastic little painting tell you what let's start out and hammer on all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me and as usual they'll come across in the same orders I have them on the palette starting with a white and working all the way around what's going up to the canvas here I've got my standard all 18 by 24 canvas up here and it's all covered with liquid white and it's ready to go so let's let's get started today I'm going to start out with a touch of phthalo blue just a touch it's very strong very strong and will reach up here and grab a touch of the midnight black and put in there somehow we have black and blue or blue and black just tap it into the bristles okay let's go right up here let's just build a happy little sky and I'm just going to make little X's little crisscross strokes and work all the way across the canvas just keep going all the way across and you can add a little more colors you need it now by starting at the top working all the way across and then working downward your color will mix with a liquid white and automatically automatically it'll get lighter and lighter toward the horizon you don't have to do a thing it'll work for you automatically and in a landscape you always want it to be lighter toward the horizon and darker on the top and bottom that helps create that illusion of distance in your painting yeah we can just blend it like so like so okay then very lightly it just makes a long horizontal strokes to take out over all the brush marks now that they bite while we have this old dirty brush going I'm going to go right back into my blue back into the blue and the black same old colors and let's have some water in this painting I'd love to paint water water is so fantastic and it's one of the easiest things to do in this technique so start on the outside and pull inward start at the bottom and work up that way automatically once again it gets lighter and lighter toward the horizon see by pulling from the outside in you don't have any strong edges here that you have to blend out it's very soft very soft it works much better a little more of a color on the brush maybe we'll do the other side pull from the outside in and I want to leave a little area open here if everything works just right it'll look just like a little sheen of light coming across the water make your painting pretty when it's done there and that easy the handy when you get you got your water in it very lightly Jesus grazing the campus just bring it all together and your light area still remains in there and as we work farther and farther to the painting you'll see why that light area so so valuable comes your good friend alright let's wash our brush and we wash our brushes with odorless thinner and are really thick I really recommend you use elders thinner you're going to be working by yourself there's a screen in the bottom of the candida scrub the brush against it allows the solid materials to settle to the bottom it will shake off the excess and then let's beat the devil that's the most fun part of this whole technique but if you do that in your living room you're gonna get run out in the yard let's build a happy little cloud today I'm going to use we use a one-inch brush you can do it with a fan brush to the two-inch I'll just use one-inch be right back get a touch of bright red just a touch pull quite a bit of coloring to the brush against go up here maybe their lives up here in this guy a happy little cloud that floats around it just has fun all day see keep the brush moving keep the brush moving tight little circular strokes and you have to make big decisions here where does your cloud live he lives right there and just drop him in okay maybe he's got a friend there's his friend lives right there maybe this is a lady friend fair see how easy that is do you can do it you can do it I get so many letters and stuff from people bitter they never believed they never believed that they could paint and you wouldn't believe some of the some of the pictures they send me of the paintings oh my gosh it it really makes it all worthwhile and young people I have so many young friends they are doing some of the most beautiful paintings you've ever seen there we go well we just cannot get to talk in here and I just put clouds all over the place now with a clean dry brush be sure your brushes dirt couldn't and couldn't dry Oh tongue got over my teeth or I couldn't see what I was saying it okay now I'm just gonna blend the the base of these clouds out little tiny circles tiny little circles there you go see just blend the base out over here blend it out a little bit and then very lightly lift it up lift it up fluff it and then blend it not a super nice easy way to make a beautiful little cloud and as traditional painter clouds used to give me a fit neither one of the easiest things there is to do look at there see just very loose fluffy and you can make a happy little cloud and we wash your brush one more time I just I just like to beat on that brush that's where you take out all your frustrations let's build a mountain in this way I lived in Alaska for over a dozen years and I'm crazy about mountains we'll take some black some pression blue put some Van Dyke Brown shoot lip there alizarin crimson in there tools we get in blue black brown crimson looking for a good dark color cut us off a little roll of paint right I'll edge the knife okay now then decide where you mountain lips and maybe in your world it lives right here push very firmly and all you're all you're worried about is a outside edge here you could really care less what's going on inside this mountain see that's all you're looking for and mountains are one of the most fun and educational things to paint because it'll teach you how to how to make friends with this old knife and this knife can do some of the most fantastic things magical but it's like everything else you have to make friends with it devote a little time to practice scrape off all excess paint just really get in there you can probably hear how hard I'm scraping really get in there and scrape it out you're not gonna hurt the canvas you're not gonna hurt his cuff it's really tough now we take the large brush in a while pull at color because this canvas is wet you can move the color I would blend it out if you can see the entire Mountain it's always more distinct at the top than it is at the bottom because of mist and pollution and all those things in that breakup a diffuse light so by allowing it to just blend out on the base like yes that happens automatically see that Maui looks like it's just floating out there in the sky floating Mountain floating Mountain tainless let's put some snow on the mountain and when you're doing this at home maybe maybe you don't want to have snow on it maybe you want to have rocks and stuff change the color the white shows up much better for television so I'm going to use white today I will put a touch of the just a touch of the bright red in there and I say touch because very quickly very quickly you can set your white on fire okay cut across and once again we need that little roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife okay now then take the point of the knife put it right up here on the point your mountain no pressure no pressure no pressure just let it float just let it float and you want the paint to break and by break means have all these holes left in it and you need a firm paint to do this if you're using a paint that's Tanner Olli you're gonna probably become a bud mixer and you're probably gonna be upset with me so be sure your paint is good and firm should be very dry and then it'll do this okay no pressure though absolutely no pressure and as teaching my son Steve to paint I used to tell you just to pretend he was a whisper floating across the mountain a little bit right there yeah then I'm gonna take some white let's use a little touch of the Prussian blue quite a little touch of Prussian blue doesn't take much of that Prussian blue boy it's strong it is strong one tube the ocean would change the color okay pull it out very flat once again cut across and get our little roll of paint we need that now then notice here that all the angles are going basically in the same direction all the highlight angles now then when we start putting the shadows on they'll go in the opposing or opposite angle C and that makes it that makes those highlights just pop out now if you want this little peak to be in the background put that shadow in first then when you come here bring this one distinctly through and that easy that easy you pushed a mountain back told you had a lot of power here put a little touch right in there this peak right there needs us onto the shadow there we go and let's hit paint break some very delicate touch very delicate touch and you can sort of work it back and forth redefine in firm is making that comes upon out right on around when you're practicing get an old canvas or something and just paint mountain after Mountain it'll teach you control t cheha to make some of these fantastic effects good clean dry brush home I want to again create the illusion of mist out here so very gently following the angles of the mountain always following those angles just tap too sure your brush is clean and dry then lightly there's two hairs and some air lift upward two hairs no smear boy that is light that's barely grazing the canvas over here all of these angles and same thing lift up for you but just on the pace I miss you a little trick maybe maybe you want to show another range of mountains right in front here okay watch here watch here watch here start often to put a little highlight on there see they're very goofs maybe who knows maybe in your world maybe there's a bump that's right there all you have to do make a decision and drop it in cuz you can do anything on this canvas anything that you want to do that easy but now we need a shadow watch right here see this makes no sense until you slip back in here and put a happy little shadow right in there Boop just jumps right up here all right here we go just like happens see every highlight needs its own shadow or it won't come out and play with you all right couple here and there okay and then clean dry brush and we'll put some mist at the base of this little mountain let's see how you can put another mountain right in front of that one that easy that easy I told you you had power you can do anything all right any old thing okay okay let's have some fun we'll just keep that same old mountain color we got here that was black Prussian blue some Van Dyke browns and crimson and I'll add a little touch of SAP green to it just a little bit of SAP green so we have a very dark color okay clean off my knife and we reach over here today let's let's use a one inch brush I'm gonna go right into that color just just tap a little color in there let's go right right down at the base of this mountain and maybe down in here there's some little trees and bushes that live right down in here just push Bend the brush upward push it that makes all those little things just happen that easy there they go there's another one wherever you want him to be there looks I have got a heck of a mess there let me show you though see now one of the things used to drive me crazy when I was traditional painter was reflections watch how easy just grab that and pull it down because the canvas is wet the paint will move and reflections can be made that easy pull straight down and then go lightly across just enough to distort it a little they had easy instant reflections instant reflections and now let's put some highlights on there I'll dip a 1 inch brush into a touch of the just a touch of the liquid white will go through some yellow I reach up here and grab some Sam green okay a lot of paint let's go ahead up in here now then let's just come right in here and we'll throw some beautiful little highlights on these and we'll sort of vary the colors and I'll hit a little ochre little Indian yellow here and maybe I'm a little touch of bright red see now while you have this on brush we can reflect some of it right down into the water should we're having so much fun with reflections here why not keep them going it's another little bush let him reflect right into the water right into the water maybe this one right here mmm oh that's a pretty black Tim down into the water not on right there wherever you think they should live see then go in and push the brush upward and just let see there and that's super just make all kinds a happy little things a little bit right down in here they have it back to the 2 inch brush and two hairs and some air again very lightly just caress it make love to it straight down straight down and very lightly go across very lightly and that is super way to make those mirror reflections and it's easy it's easy I don't take a touch of the liquid white to that I'll add a little bit of a little bit of brown a little bit of a dark Sienna pull it out very flat and then cut across it okay let's go up here now with that I'll reach right in here and use a firm pressure and let's just cut in a little water let you really get tough with it cut it right into the right into the fabric just really cut it they're that easy and put a little ripple here near if you want it that sort up to you now keep these water lines and ripples basically straight if they're not if they're not straight your water looked like he's going around right out of that right out of your painting on the floor and get the floor wet we don't want that to happen okay he's going right back to the one-inch brush into the dark color very dark color pull the brush a lot of paint give it a wiggle we're trying to return to make a sharp chisel HCS sharp pet brushes very sharp takes a lot of paint on the bristles to hold it together okay now then maybe their lives in our world right here a happy little evergreen tree and we start off by just making a line than just using the corner of the brush yeah and you can do this with a two inch pressure or the fan brush pen brush makes nice delicate goes one-inch brush anything anything there okay between each tree bring it back to a nice sharp chisel edge very sharp just the corner of the brush as you work down the tree add more and more pressure and you're using more of the brush but the angle that you hold the brush is basically the same through the entire tree it's just that you're adding more and more pressure so it pushes pins the brush okay I tell you what I tell you what miss having one more right there right there yeah two trees are soonerlater you didn't you have a third with you know the little rascals or you got to watch it there okay now maybe under here something lives little bushes and stuff live right out here just push them in just push push the brush upward now one thing you'll avoid don't let the brush slide if the brush slides let's watch it if it slides you're gonna get that kind of effect don't let it slide push it bend it okay now a little bit of that down here we'll have some reflections in this water I like I like reflections in that the nicest way you've ever seen to make reflections there tell you what we don't want this other side to get left out all I have the old brush dirty here let's go in the other side up I'll reload the brush the same way bringing it to a nice sharp chisel edge alright let's go back up here maybe I have a big ever great this right here is the corner of the brush back and forth had a lady in class one time she called these Z trees like Zorro that's sort of a good analogy sorta just back and forth back and forth I taught traveled and taught for many many years and met some of the most fantastic people country and I still correspond with a lot of them because you can't believe some of the paintings people are doing now after taking a class in a couple of years of practice it's just unreal we have several people that have literally quit their job and it went into painting full-time now they're happier painting makes you happy don't think you can be saying and do this shoot let's have another little Bush this right here like so I've got too old and tired I don't do much traveling and teaching anymore we have a staff of teachers at travel and teach now and they're fantastic fantastic same same old color here same color just pop in some little things wherever you want to I'm not careful and cover up the whole canvas all right now then let's go back to the 2 inch brush decide where where reflection and land meet here and grab it and pull straight down it's important you pull straight down you don't want your reflections to be all crooked II okay then lightly go across see over here make the same decision where do you want this one to be right there right there right there and pulling down anything you don't like you just turn it into reflections that easy we don't make mistakes should we have happy accidents now we'll take a little bit of the dark Sienna a little white into it pull that paint out as flat as I can get it cut across and once again we have that small little roll of paint okay let's go ahead up here this whole evergreen tree we'll just put the indication here and there a little trunk in there like so same thing on the other side just wherever you think they should be and you won't see the whole truck so just here and there you can also just taking straight through and make all kind of little bushes and sticks and twigs and people think you spent a lot of time a lot of time putting them rascals in don't you tell them any different that's our secret all right we'll take some yellow I'll reach up here and grab a little bit of black black and yellow make a beautiful beautiful dark green pull it brush in one direction okay and then let's just begin popping in some little highlights on these trees I think about the individual limbs that live in this tree don't just throw these on at random I know sometimes it looks that way but sort of think think like a tree there we go back up a little bit of the yellow ocher and we can begin reflecting this right into the water if your paint won't stick if you have trouble making the stick add the least little touch of paint thinner or a little bit of the liquid white either one but working layers doing the the bush or the tree this is a father's two way and coming forward and see how you can create the illusion of distance and depth that easy that is there's another hmm what's the sparkler there very little devil like him I account there see these little these little things are real to me somebody wrote me a letter such as you referred these things like they were real people they have arms and legs and you know you have to be a little weird to be a painter so they're real to me these are my friends all right tell you what school on the other side same thing same thing let's put some happy little bushes and trees and oh that's a basement and there's nothing wrong with making friends with nature nothing wrong with it one day nature's gonna take over again and you're gonna need a friend there give a touch of the bright-red maybe oh there's a pretty look at that son of a gun shine right up in there there we go another one once again though we're layering these so it creates that illusion of the distance and we can reflect some of that right into the water so easy it is to make some of the most striking reflections and if you're out selling paintings for this what this will sell your painting people love these little reflections now pull straight down very light very very light I mean just who won here and some air okay now then took a little bit of Van Dyck Brown tonight we need some land for all this to set I don't want to fall over in the water make a big splash to treat a drowned you just made friends with him there and maybe right up in here look at that look at that think about the lay of the land and pull this just like just like it was real just give it a pool because water normally sets in a recessed area so you want this to be a have the impression to lower its not take some darks and a little Van Dyck Brown a little white and let's come right in here and put a few little highlights on this see there make it look like rocks and stones and all kinds of little things that easy but angles are very important a little bit of liquid white and we drop in just a little water lines in here just like we did in the background just cut them in on the other side see here and let me take your soul breath I'm just gonna put a few highlights all clock on the wall tells me it's about time to go for today so as I finish up this tree here I'd like to I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless and I'll see you next time you you
