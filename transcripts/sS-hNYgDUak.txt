glad to see you today you got the liquid white on your canvas your colors all set up ready to go well I hope so today I thought we'd do a fantastic little painting that's very simple and we're only going to use about three colors some black and white a little bit of crimson we'll have them run those colors across your screen so you'll have them at home and let's go on up here and get started now I've already got to cover the canvas covered here with a nice even coat of the liquid white it's all wet and slick and ready to go go right into a tiny bit of alizarin crimson with a two inch brush pull it out and just gently tap a little bit in I'm going to use this only one time in this entire painting just one time but look here see by tapping it to get a nice even distribution of color all the way through the bristles okay let's go up here and maybe right there right there there's a tiniest tiniest little bit of pink just a little bit of color this painting is gonna be just in gray tones except for this one tiny little area right here put this in here just to warm it up a little bit I'm gonna do a little winter see a little winter scene and these monochromatic type pictures are excellent to teach you how to use values there we go and that's the only time they need any crimson in this whole painting now then let's begin playing a little bit I'm gonna go right into the black don't even have to wash your brush this is a very strong color it'll just cover up the crimson no problem just pull out a little bit of color tap it into the bristles just like we did before you work both sides and look at the brush see you have a nice even distribution of color if you don't tap if you just reach up in here with a brush like yet and pull out a big hug you go and go up to the canvas and have huge streaks alright let's go up and do this now then let's put some happy little cloud things all there just floating around now this will this will mix the liquid white in all kinds of beautiful little colors will happen little values let the canvas work let the brush work just have fun here just let this wander around play wherever you want it to go there we go maybe a little touch right here and I'm using basically just the corner of the brush making little tiny circles little tiny circles and don't stay in one place and just keep grinding it keep the brush moving so you get all kinds of little actions happening here all right now let me wash the brush then we wash the obession this is just with odorless paint thinner there's a screen in the bottom I can hear shake it off okay that really is the fun part of this whole technique okay let's go back up here now and I'm gonna begin just gently blending this use all kinds of little patterns little circles little X's keep it moving keep it alive keep actions in here there we go just keep working it working it look at that see just I'm basically still just using the corner of the brush and now I'm allowing this black color which is turned to gray because it's mixed with a liquid white to begin coming down here and into the pink area there we go little tiny circles and X's and all kinds of little patterns there just blend it blend it blend it see now at this point it looks like a nice stormy sky you could stop at this point if you wanted to and just have a nice stormy sky big snowstorms coming thunderstor whatever you want to do on you're doing your painting well I've got it on the brush and one we just put a little bit of grey down here this is just a nice way also of cleaning off any excess paint you have on your brush okay have it let's have some fun wash your brush again there shake it off now then today I'm gonna I'm gonna use the oval round brush I'm gonna grab go right into some of the titanium white there we go pull it through there get a lot of paint on it a lot of paint look at the end of that brush it's full of paint okay let's go up here now then you have to make some decisions I decided today I want some happy little clouds in this guy just let them bounce around and play em back just throw them in that's wrong keep that brush going in little circular patterns little circular patterns there we are you have to make decisions where's your cloud live all there it comes right down through there keep the brush moving there's a little hair we'll just lift it right off they get a hair on you when you canvas just take the corner your brush pop it off it's no big deal there look at that all kinds of little actions happening in the sky all right now let me take let me take the 2 inch brush and now very gently I'm gonna begin blending the bottom of this decide which are your tops up here we don't want to destroy them we just want to blend the bottom make it very soft bring all this together this is like we normally do clouds and hey most of the other paintings that we've done the head clouds in them it's just that we're using very few colors in this one there back of there look at yes now though the white that I picked up here I'm just adding it right down in hearing me the indication of all kinds of little things happening I'm just gonna begin blending this you can lift it in some places some don't it's a fun little sky be happy when you do this there we go remember how free clouds are they just float around the sky just lay around the scowl they have any fun there look how things are happening in that sky dock and you've really done very little work but there's a lot of depth in it and if you want to create the illusion of even more depth you can come back in here and put in more individual clouds and there's really no limit to this you can put as many layers of clouds in your world as you want I don't stop I'm not gonna have time to get the rest of the painting done I get carried away some time on clouds I like to do them beautiful just blend a blend of plan okay that looks like a Minos guy I think that's enough for stuff to have right there we wash a couple of these brushes up and we'll be ready to go all right okay and I'll wash the round one two while I'm in the brush washing business I've already got the cameraman mad at me over there where we got him again all right no we just use the old round brush I'll go into a little bit of white and a little bit of the black and must go make a greyish colour here and turn it just like so back and forth back and forth okay see that brings it to not quite a chisel edge but it's sort of sharp let's go up here maybe we back here in the distance somewhere there's a happy little foothill that lives so all you do is touch just using the corner see and pull it downward just pull it down right make all these happy little foothills there we go whatever whatever they have to make decisions where they live what it look like stab me get it I'm tapping and giving it a little pull downward tiniest little pull down right okay now them to help create the illusion of mist here I won't take the 2 inch brush and just half the base just the base so I don't I don't want to destroy the tops the base and then very lightly lift up right you know we say over and over again about creating depth in your painting depth in a painting is created by having different planes in your painting the more planes you have the deeper the painting looks so I want to create another plane here use the same brush the same color only I add a little bit more of the black each plane as it gets closer to you you should get a little darker okay let's go back up here now maybe there's some happy little things that live right here just some little trees and stuff this is still back in the distance so we don't want a lot of detail yet got to save the detail till we get in the foreground maybe just works its way right up through there wherever you want to go I'm just using the just the top part of the brush here just touch it pull it down see very gently you don't have to hit the canvas hard just just drop it in you could literally do this painting with one brush if you wanted to now then go back to the 2 inch brush and just tap I want to create that illusion of mist again mist is the only separator we have in all these planes see right here where these planes come together but the thing separates them is that little light area right in between see if they wasn't that little light area they would just almost blend together cause there's very little difference in color now very lightly very lightly lift upward create all the happy little misty effects hmm didn't that simple there's a lot of fun let's use old fan brush today we'll take a fan brush there we go you're right into a little bit of the white lo that fan brush full a lot of paint into it both sides look see a lot of paint in there let's go up here now you have to may start making some decisions maybe there's some little snowy things that live way back here and this is where you begin creating the lay of the layer the way the land flows and think about where your lights gonna strike maybe maybe there's a hill right there you can begin creating all these little things maybe this haloruns we don't know where it goes baby runs right on up through there somewhere very soft strokes always always always paying attention to the lay of the land maybe there's a little light hits right there on that see how that pops right out at you snow scenes are very easy to make like yes very very easy I'll go back to this whole round brush just tap it in tap it in maybe maybe tell you what tree right here see here we can let him come right down the hill a little bit and create another layer another plane and the more these you have once again I know you get tired of hearing me say it bit more the more of these that you have deeper your paintings gonna look now will take a little bit of the white and I'm gonna grab some of this bottom color and just pull it out let it be shadows this is what separates this is what separates all the little goodies all the pretty things here and you could put little bumps and Wiggles and you know there's there's little stones and here that the snows on you can't see the stone but the light hits it makes all those little things happen okay you can even grab some of this lift it up over there all kinds of happy little things I hope you enjoy these paintings that we do ever so often they just have one or two colors of is it really really if you're doing a linked home with this it'll really teach you probably more than the ones that have a lot of color in them there tap a little of that and just so you for bringing a little that up pushes all that back and every once in a while when you're painting step back and look at your painting when you step back you get a whole different whole different view than when you're standing this close to it and looking okay let's have some fun here must be crazy I'll just use this old big brush here grab a little white in there so it's not totally dire black yeah pull it through the paint and wiggle it give it a little wiggle that brings a pain out toward the heel of the bristles and then sharpen it just like you would a fine knife look how sharp doesn't brushes right there look at that you could almost shape of that all right maybe there's a happy tree that lives right there see there you can really see how sharp it is and we'll take just the corner of the brush and we'll begin laying in all kinds of little leaves there they come look at that to her thank you could take a bigger brush like it can make a little tree you can you can watch here you can use the same brush and just happen all kinds of little pushes and stuff it just grow right down at his foots maybe this comes right on down we'll just tap it in like that right I don't down there that easy okay find my fan brush again into a little bit of the white and we'll pick this up layer after layer after layer there we go you know one of the questions I have mentioned some of the earlier shows that we travel all over the country doing demonstrations for our PBS stations and other organizations and I've got several letters and saying well half a world we find out when you're going to be in town probably one of the easiest ways drop me a line with just your name an address on it and I'll put your name in our in our mailing list and we'll notify you of any activity we have going on in your area you can just you just send it and cure the address at the end of the show that's good and just put a note on there she'd like to be added on to them to the mailing list so you could be notified when we're in your area cuz we'd like to see you and talk to you there okay maybe I'm back in here you'll take a little bit more I'm just going crazy here I'm just making plane after plane won't drop him at a happy little thing and this is us excellent painting if this is one of your first paintings excellent because it's really nothing that can go wrong with it and a lot of times the fact is the same way I started a lot of times you want to teach a friend or maybe a grandchild or something this is a good painting to start a first first-time painter it's hard to make a mistake maybe there's a little thing right there it lives all kinds a little there and you can also do this in color you can use all kinds of colors and it pinks and blues and lavenders is very very pretty very pretty don't be afraid to let some color I tell you what I'll tell you I must do maybe there's a little bit of water right here now we know water is easy to make so just take the big brush and pull down pull down had to make some decisions whereas the water live pull it down pull it down pull it down and you can move your water maybe it goes on back here way so we don't know where it goes where you want to go make a decision drop in here you're all we're doing is applying a little color to the canvas pull it down straight down it's important that these reflections are straight down then we'll take a clean brush give it a pull there we are mmm okay now watch here very lightly go across just go across with it and you can wiggle some of these so here you take the brush side words give it a little push look at there see how that just moved you can make a little shimmers in the water just by pushing it in either direction can well go into a little bit of the liquid white down leave a thinner paint back into the titanium white just makes it pretty good in full let's go in here let's begin putting some little edges around here this paints a little bit thinner so it sticks much easier keep the brush full of paint all kinds of little peninsulas and little things happening out here there we go and this is cold there may be some snow laying out here keep you strokes basically straight basically straight there maybe a little bit right up in here wherever you want to go on the other side I'll probably put something over here and kill all this but I always want to show you how to do it there now you could take some liquid white the almighty knife here pull it out very flat cut across it let's do that again so you can see it very close that's one of the biggest problems that people write and tell me they're having pull it out flat and cut across that way there's a tiniest little bit of paint right on the edge of the knife on the top edge there you can see it Tiny's alleged paint there let's go up here yeah that's another question I get quite frequently is your knife looks different than my who we covered so it doesn't shine and glare on TV if I didn't if I didn't cover it with paint or some other material we would to cause big flares on your screen and he wouldn't be pretty besides that - director backyard scream at me she's mean she gets me there we go I shouldn't say that about Sally she's a super lady and she produces some beautiful shows for us it's probably too late now I'm in trouble anyway no matter what to say all right there we go and we can take the knife we put the indication here and there a few little happy sticks little twigs wherever you want them just scratch him in okay now then maybe this tree here maybe I'll take a little bit of gray on the knife and I'm just gonna put the indication of a little trunk in it don't want to want a big deal just a little indication and with my fan brush loaded with tiniest little bit of white I'm just barely barely gonna let it just caress here and there don't overdo don't overdo you could also use the two-inch brush or the one-inch brush to do this I just happen to have this in my hand and it has the right color on it just enough to make it stand out tall that's all you need ok-hee see and that easy with just basically two colors we've created a pretty nice painting let's have some more fun I'll just take the same old two-inch brush and go right into the black and I want to bring it back to a nice sharp chisel edge so I wiggle it wiggle wiggle we're gonna pull it pull it once again a very sharp chisel edge just like a razor case go clear maybe maybe there's a huge big tree then there better be one there now well we've certainly put a big gob in this guy just the corner of the brush let's do this one's quite slow so you can watch it here see work it back and forth and just tapping and touching and I did work down I'm using the same corner of the brush just going from side to say I think one of the problems so many people try to do this I use the same corner the same corner and we all know that an evergreen tree has 500 limbs on it at least but if you put 500 limbs on there it's gonna it doesn't look right think about think about the little birds need a place to set I just have them them sticking out here for the birds we have to take care of them they're my friends I I feed the little birds every day I get a whole bunch of them and come to my house if I don't feed them on time you know they're just they're just like puppies way they get how Terry's King I stand out there oh there goes my little area burgers would get after in the backyard and squawk and carry on I spent all my money on birdseed I keep them keep the birds eat people in business that's sorry I like birds okay now then let's go right back down here I'll use the same old dirty brush and pull it this way one direction one direction see there so we've rounded one corner by pulling it in one direction all right let's go up here with a rounded corner up let's pop in a few little indication to some happy little bushes just drop them in wherever you want them to go see how you can change is seen though very quickly quickly now then take my knife just a little bit of this great color hey let's just drop in a little bit of trunk here and there this one's a little closer I'll take a little a little the black and white make a lighter gray color but like so and cut across it get a little roll of paint okay let's go up here and we'll put touch of little highlights on this trunk it's closer so you're gonna see a little more detail there it's enough let's use another one of these big brushes go into the liquid white into the titanium white and we're gonna bring it to a chisel edge also very sharp very very sharp these brushes come to super sharp points okay let's go up here now then we need to put some little sparkles on this tree same way as we made it just barely touching don't kill all your dark areas don't kill all those dark areas they're very important just let all these little snow-covered things set in here and they're just where you think light would strike and then a super simple nice easy way make a fantastic big ole tree okay no then take up a one-inch brush once again right into the liquid white back into my titanium white pull that brush in one direction to cause a round corner on it and see there you can see it beautifully round corner King's Cup here now with that round corner to the top touch push bend it slightly upward that's what makes all these little snow-covered bushes and begin forming them look at that look at that thousands of little leaves there in just a couple of strokes do one Bush at a time remember that each one of these little bushes is a personality all by itself there we go just drop these in as many of them as you want there we go use the bright side words off in little layers I can you could take you so big brush and maybe maybe there's a little bit of land area right there just by going across you can create that illusion there and we drop in a few more little bushes around the path bring it all together add a few of them just play here and there then we can take the knife scrape in a few little sticks and twigs and you have a finished painting that's simple see I think you'll find this one of the easiest paintings there is to do and I hope you try it so from all of us here happy painting god bless you you
