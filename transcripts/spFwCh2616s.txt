- Well hello, glad you
could join me today. Today I thought we'd do a
fantastic little painting that is a lot of fun, I
think you'll enjoy it. We'll start off and we'll
have 'em graphically run all the colors across the screen. They'll come across your
screen in the same order that I have them on the pallet, starting with the white
and working around. And while they're doing that, let's go up to the canvas and get started. I've already covered
the canvas with a thin, even coat of Magic White and that makes the canvas wet and slick and it allows to blend
color right on the canvas. So, let's start off,
we'll take a small amount of Prussian Blue. Thalo blue, I'm sorry. Thalo blue. Thalo blue. And let's go right here, and let's just make little
criss cross strokes. Thalo blue is a very,
very bright, shiny blue. It's very pretty. Get a little more of the
thalo blue on the brush. Maybe, right here, just like so. And maybe there's a little in there, wherever you want it,
wherever you want it. Maybe while I get a little on the brush. We'll have some water in this painting, so I'll just go ahead and just do like so. We don't know exactly where
the water's gonna be yet, we're not really worried about it. We'll make those big decisions later. Okay let me clean the brush. Scrub it off right there. There we go. Let's go right up here. And we'll just blend this, and you could blend it to
whatever value that you want. The Magic White underneath will continually mix with the color. You can make it softer and softer and softer just by blending. I don't want to kill all
the little light areas, I want some little streaks here. There we go. And that gives us a very effective, very quick little sky, easy to do. And we're all ready. Let's build a happy
little mountain back here. I'll go right into some Van Dyke brown. Van Dyke brown. I'm gonna put a small
amount of alazarin crimson, little bit of burnt umber into it. Now you pull that paint out
just as flat as you can get it, really get tough with
it, pull it out flat. And then sort of cut across so you have a small roll of paint right
out on the edge of the knife, it's very important, need
that little roll of paint. Let's go up to the canvas,
maybe, maybe, maybe. Yep there goes that little mountain. We want it to come right about in there, wherever you want it, it's your mountain, so you put it where you want it. Little more color and maybe, yep, there it goes, right on up. And all we're doing here is just laying in our basic shape, we're
not worried about detail, or anything else. Just a basic shape. I'm really pushing this
color into the canvas. Act like you're trying to push
it right through the canvas. Canvas is strong, you're
not gonna hurt it, don't worry about it. Very strong. Now take a large brush and I
wanna pull this paint down, and because the canvas is
wet, we can move color. If it was a dry canvas you'd have a devil of a time trying to do this. But since it's wet, you
can move paint all over. There we go. Just pull it down. And that gives us a basic
shape for a mountain. And let's go back here
and take titanium white, and we load the knife the same way. Add a small amount of brown
to it, just to dull it down. So we have titanium white and the least little amount of brown. Cut across it, need that small,
small roll of paint again. There we go, very important. Let's go up here, now touch the canvas. Gentle, gentle pressure. Gentle pressure, and just
let it float right down. Think where light would strike this. Just let it float. There. No pressure,
absolutely no pressure. Just pretend you're a whisper
floating across a mountain. If you apply a bunch of pressure, it's gonna look just like you iced a cake. So no pressure, can't say that enough. Gentle, gentle touch. Maybe, maybe, yep there it is. Comes right down. Could put a little bit
more of the brown in there. There we go. Just bring it down. We'll take a little more
of the Van Dyke brown. And make a darker color, and
let's go right up in here. And let's begin adding
some shadows in here. Just here in there, let
'em fall off your knife. Still no pressure, no pressure. You want that paint to play,
and you want it to break. So all those little things
happen automatically. You don't wanna have to worry about 'em. Let it happen, said it over and over... We don't make mistakes,
we have happy accidents. And the worst thing you can
do here is good, no problem. Maybe over in here we'll put
some more of the dark color. It's going to be a nice
dark shadow right in there. We'll just let it go have fun. We'll begin playing back and forth between shadow and highlight. And just sort of visualize
these things in your mind. Just sort of visualize them in your mind, let 'em flow right off your knife. Maybe, maybe, there it is, right there. See? That's simple, you can make some beautiful,
beautiful little mountains. Just let it go. Let' go back into some
of our darker color. We need a little shadow back here. And you can just play. You can really spend some time here and put detail into what
you just wouldn't believe could be done with a big ol' knife in a very short time. That'll give us a good idea and show you how to make these kind of mountains. There. Alright. Now I wanna make these
mountains a little bit softer, want a little mist at the bottom. So I'm gonna take the large brush and just gently, gently tap
the bottom, just the bottom. This will make 'em very soft, quiet. Create the illusion of
mist down at the bottom. Most important when you're doing this that you follow the angles,
follow those angles. If you don't, you just beat 'em up and they'll go away and leave you. And you don't want that,
you want the mountains to stay with you and be
happy to be with you. Want 'em to become your friend. Then just blend the bottom out. Maybe, maybe let's grab the ol' fan brush. Maybe in this mountain,
let's get some sap green. Little sap green. Maybe there's a few
little bushes and stuff that try to grow up here. So just go right up here, and let's just-- This is just straight sap green. Here and there, ah there he is little ol' bush and tree
tryin' to make it up here. But life's tough up here
on top of this mountain. So there we go. Put a few of those right here. There we go, there's some more. Still you wanna follow these angles. You don't wanna lose these angles. Wherever you think something might get a little
foothold there and grow, just drop 'em off. And it makes it a little more exciting, a little more interesting. Just use a corner of a brush here and you can just pick up,
make it look like little... See there? Easy. You can just make all kinds
of little things happen. Wherever you think they should be. There's one right there. That's where they oughta
be, where you decide. 'Cause this is your painting, your world. Let it happen. Kay, maybe, maybe, maybe, right in here. All kinds, wherever. Then we can take our
large brush and just... Gently, gently, gently, tap a little. Be careful here, you don't
want to hit that green, pull it all up into your mountain. Just wanna make some
nice edges underneath. Okay, that'll give you and idea of how to make a super little mountain. This painting I took from a photograph that a friend gave me,
that was taken in Arizona. I always thought Arizona
was nothing but deserts and beautiful, beautiful
reddish colored mountains. But it's not, it has
everything, it has it all. Okay we'll just use a single big brush. We'll go right into some sap green, little bit of alizarin
crimson, Van Dyke brown, just mix these colors on the brush, load a lot of paint in the brush. Pull it through the paint,
pull it through the paint. Let's look at this brush, look at the end. Tremendous amount of paint. Okay and there's a rounded corner 'cause you pulled in one direction. You want that rounded corner to be on top. Let's go up to the canvas. Now maybe there's a nice
tree that lives right there. Right there. And you just push, bend. And all we're doing is putting
in some background color. We're not looking for shape, detail, anything else right now. All we're looking for is
just background color. Then we'll come back in here and we'll put all kinds
of highlights and leaves and all the beautiful little things. Wherever you want, just
looking for background color. Okay. See all that gives you good idea of where you're going and
what you're going to make. The way you lay out some basic shapes. And while I have this color on the brush, I know this is going to be water and I want some reflections in my water. I think we'll do a little stream today. But even in a stream you have
dark color that's reflected. You may not see it 'cause the water's bubbling and churning and having fun, but it's there. There's still that dark color. And you need the dark so
your light will show up when we highlight the water. Let's just go across. That'll help give it
the impression of water. Make you feel better, just
go across, instant water. Okay now we can go back in here and we can begin working on
some of these pretty things. I think a little paint
thinner on my brush, and we'll go right into some sap green, and then into a little cad yellow. So we get sap green, cad yellow. And I want to keep the
greens pretty dark here. Pull it through the paint, one direction, just like we did the big brush. See? Now turn it over, so that
rounded corner is on the top. Let's go in here maybe. Right in here there's a happy little bush, just barely touching. Just enough to bend the
bristles the smallest amount. Lotta paint on the brush. Lotta paint. And we'll go into some Indian yellow and yellow ochre, little bit of that. Just break it up a little co
the color's not all the same. And some sap green, some yellow ochre. Pretty color, very pretty color. Just drop that right in. There. that just gives us some
nice little basic shapes. Some ideas back here. Alright I'm gonna take
the script liner brush, number two script liner brush. Put a little paint thinner on it, then we'll go right up
into this brown color, and let's put a few little limbs in there. And turn that brush,
bring it to nice sharp, sharp points, just like
so. Let's go right up here. Maybe, maybe, maybe, leave some. Some sticks and some twigs right out here, they live everywhere. Anywhere. Maybe some here and there. Right there. Wherever. Make these decisions, drop 'em in. This is your world, so you
figure out where the sticks live. Now without cleaning the brush, go right into a little bit of white and that brown right there
will make a whole new color. Let's go right up here
and we can put some in... that are a little lighter in value, and they stand out against the dark. If they won't stick, add a
little bit of paint thinner. There we go, just drop
these in here and there. Alright, we'll go back into the brown. Van Dyke brown, let's put a
little burnt umber with it. Get a little bit on the knife. Let's begin thinking about where we're going to have some land areas. And I'm just barely touching the canvas, letting the paint break. Want this to look very rocky and... Rough. What my dog used to say, rough. There we go. Just very loose. Very loose, don't worry about
it, have fun right here. Just pull that knife across. All you're worried about it
the general lay of the land. Just pull it in the angle
you want your land to go. We'll take some brown and white
and we'll come back in here and just like when we did the mountain. Lightest, lightest pressure. Virtually no pressure. And all we're doin' here just barely, barely lettin' it graze
so it hits the high spots, just the high spots. Barely touching. Sometimes it's very pretty. Add a little yellow ochre
to your color and watch. Yellow ochre and white, it's very pretty. Makes nice stones. Okay, now then. We can continue to work on
our little grassy areas. So let's go right here, make
another happy little bush. There he is. A little yellow ochre,
let it come right down, let it work right down to this land area. Just let it go. Keep the paint quite
thin so it sticks easy. Then paint the stick to a thick paint. We have thick paint underneath so now we can stick layers of
thinner paint right on top, without destroying, without
becoming a mud mixer. And if you've painted, all of us have experienced mud mixing. We all have to have a
little shot at mud mixing. Okay now, maybe there's
somethin' on the other side. Let's do sap green to Van
Dyke brown to crimson again, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. There's a big tree that lives right here. And we just push him in, push him in. And this tree is very dark,
I want him to stay this way. I want him to stay quite dark. This is also the way you cover up the end of your mountain,
close that end off. Don't have to worry about it no more. And I'm pushing very, very hard. Really push your paint into the canvas, and it comes right out like this. Wherever you want. At the same time we get this
old dirty brush, same here. We need to pull down some reflections. We need that dark area in the water. Cut across. That easy. Now this little lighter
brush, I never cleaned it, it's still got brown on it, and I'm goin' right into the white. Turn it, bring it to a nice point. Let' go up here, put
in some general little indications of some sticks and twigs. This is just brown and white, you just let it go
wherever you want it to go. Turn that brush, turn
it as you're doing this. Sometimes that really gets some nice little things happening. Few little sticks and twigs. Just wherever you want them. There we go. And you can put as many of
these as you want in your world. Go right into some sap green
with this old dirty brush. It already has yellow on
it and everything else. Want this side to be quite dark. That's much darker, not as much light's going
to strike over here. There, that's almost straight sap green. Little bit of yellow in the
brush, but mainly sap green. Good dark rich color. Now we need just like on the other side, let's put a little bit of land in here. Just barely touching with the knife. That's Van Dyke brown. Then we'll take some brown and some white just like on the other side, just put a little bit of highlight, not quite as much, just
a little here and there. And then we bring some
of these grassy areas right down on them so it makes the grass come out over the top, Otherwise this sort of just floats around. Okay let's play with some water back here. Now I want to paint this
a little bit thinner, so I'm going to add a little
magic white to my brush, and go up here and I'm gonna use magic white and titanium white. And the magic white will
thin it down just a little. Let's start back in here,
let's just start going. So you need that dark
to make the light show. You gotta make decisions here. Some water splashing there, okay. Little splashes going wherever. If you didn't have it dark
you wouldn't see anything. This water is muddy. Comin' around the bank and
pickin' up some of the dirts. Maybe there's a little
stone under the water there and it makes it go bloop. Causes all those little splashes, just have fun with this,
just have fun with it. Back and forth and
wherever you want it to go. So you can create some of the
most beautiful little streams, and they're so easy, so easy. There. I'll leave a little of
this blue showing here. It's getting little wider here, so the water wouldn't be as rough, wouldn't be as turbulent. Just a few little ripples here and there. Don't do too many. This is where we clean
up the edges of the dirt. Just let it go there. You put all kinds of little splashes and fun little things
happening here and there. It's your stream so
you make some decisions and put 'em wherever you want 'em. There we go, right on off the canvas. That's a quick, simple little way to make a happy little stream. I've got several fan brushes going here so I'm going to go with a clean brush right into some Van Dyke brown, let's put a little paint thinner just to thin that down a small amount. Little Van Dyke brown. And I'm filling the brush up, then on the other side I'm just going to pull it through some white, so I've got Van Dyke brown on
one side, white on the other. Let's say there's a little
tree that lives right there. Now you can put as many
trees as you want in yours. Maybe he's got a friend that
lives right there beside him. Maybe he's a popular tree,
he's got several friends, we'll give him several. Maybe there's even one that
sort of comes over like this. And you can put as many trees
in your painting as you want. Here's one, maybe he's a little closer, little fatter, stronger, little
more dark on his side there. There might even be one
you can't see all of, it goes right off the canvas, how's that? Let's go on the other side,
maybe there's a big tree that lives right here. He goes into there somewhere, we don't know where he
goes, we don't care. Just like so. Then I'll take a little one inch brush and cover up his foots,
same thing over here. We need to have little grassy things around his foots, cover it up, make him fit right into the painting. And I'll go back to my lighter brush, and we wanna thin this
paint down very thin. And maybe, just very quickly here, just some indications
of a few little branches and limbs and twigs wherever you want 'em. And you can put as many
of these in as you want. I just want to put a few in to give you some ideas how they're made. Then you do what makes you happy. We just try to give you some guides here, some ideas and turn you lose. That's where the joy of painting comes in, you don't have to worry
anymore, you just let it go. And there will come a time very soon where you really don't have to
think about what's happening. At least on your pallet
you can spend all your time composing, and you can
compose while you paint. I used to spend as much time trying to figure out what to paint
as I did actually painting. And this way you can
compose right on the canvas. Right on the canvas. There's one, he comes
around right in there. Have some of 'em go across the trunk. That way they're not
all just on the sides. And they need to get a little thicker when they get towards the trunk. Just wherever you want 'em. As many as you want. Now might even be some more down in here, some more little sticks and twigs and all these little things happening. And they're not straight all the time, you got all kinds of crooks and bends. Maybe there was a fisherman out here and he stepped on that one,
put a little kink in it. Let's go over here, maybe. Little something right here. Just a little, big ol' tree
goes right off the canvas. You can come in here and put all kind of highlights and shadows
on each one of these limbs. You can spend a lot of time playing here, really having some fun, putting
a lot of detail into it. I think we're... 'bout to get differesco. If you wanna put the indication 'cause there's always
hundreds of little limbs, you can just take very lightly, put little tiny limbs in there. People think you've really
worked for a long time. But I think that'll give you an idea. So let's sign this one. Here's a little permanent red, you wanna sign it right here. All finished, I hope this one is. I hope you really liked it, we've enjoyed being with you today. So from all of us here, we'd like to wish you happy painting, God bless, see you next week. (smooth jazz music)
