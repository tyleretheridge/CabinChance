hi glad you could join me today you got your oil paints all put out and your big glass of iced tea besides you ready okay let's do it then let's start off by have them graphically put all the colors on the screen that you need to do this painting with me and they'll come across as usual in the same orders I have them on the palette starting with a white and working around now let's go on up here now I've already covered the canvas with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white it's wet and slick and it's ready to go too so let's do a fantastic little painting together and I thought today we'll start off with a the old two-inch brush and the smallest little amount of alizarin crimson very small amount and just tap the brush into that just tap it like it okay let's go right up here and maybe in the sky here there's a little bit of pink I just want a very small amount when you're doing this just use the littlest touch of paint because if you're not careful you'll set your sky right on fire and we don't want it on fire we just want a little pinkish glow in it when we're done just to brighten it up make it a very happy little sky and that's enough right there is enough okay without cleaning the brush I'm gonna go right into phthalo blue and the blue is so much stronger than the crimson you don't have to clean the brush and go right into it okay load it the same way by tapping let's go right back up here now use a little crisscross stroke start right at the top and work down to the pink just like a little crisscross strokes a little excess see they're that easy and where these come together you'll get sort of a sort of a lavender color very pretty very warm there all right let me clean the old brush we just wash it right here I have a screen in the bottom of this bucket that I scrubbed the brush against shake it off ninjas beat the devil at it now with a clean dry brush should be sure it's dry go right back up here and blend this you want to make the little excess right here where the pink and the blue come together just little crisscross okay and that's that gives us a happy little sky tell you what let's do let's put some big floating clouds up in there and I'll use the one-inch brush today pull it through the paint pull it through in one direction we will add at least little touch of bright red to it leaves a little touch don't want to set these clouds on the fire I see by pulling one direction you round one corner of the brush okay let's go up here now with this rounded corner toward the top just make little tiny circles and crease all kinds of beautiful little fluffy clouds in your sky keep the brush moving keep it moving little circles little tiny circles don't let it stay in one place you'll end up with big cotton balls in the sky and that'll sort of bother you in this over hmm and see layer after layer after layer just as many clouds as you want it's your world so you make the big decisions tell you what maybe yep let's put a happy little cloud that lives right here we know all on all of them on one side we'll have more both sides I like to make clouds when I was traditional painter clouds used to drive me crazy so I'd work with them son of a guns all day this is the easy way to do it okay now that would take clean dry a two-inch brush and come right back up here now see up in here you don't want to touch these tops all you want to do is gently gently blend the bottom use the top corner of the brush you use the bottom of the brush you're not gonna be able to tell where it's hitting you don't want to touch these nice edges I want to save those just blend right up to them and stop and don't over blend these don't over blend okay same thing on the other side it's very early touchy now then we'll lift that up very gently very gently just barely caressing the canvas barely barely touch lift it up and then very lightly very lightly blend the entire sky that'll take out all the brush marks blend everything together and that quick you've got a fantastic little sky all right let's do let's do a happy little mountain today and for that I'll take a midnight black and phthalo blue just black and blue that's all I'm going to use today midnight black a little blue now if you want to check that put a little white over there just add it because it's hard to tell what color that is a little roll of paint on the knife right out on the edge okay now you have to make some big decisions where does your mountain live and what's a shape kind of put in the shape here mmm that mountains grow different all over the country sofa the mountains in your area are different in what I paint just use the idea of how to paint mountains to do the ones in your area the principles are about the same no matter what can the mountains your pain there that's just blue and black scrape off the excess paint now then with a 2 inch brush I'm going to begin just tapping and getting a little that color on the brush now I want to put a distant Mountain back here so just using that color that I picked up just tap and look for there that easy Pat easy you can create the illusion of a little mountain it's far in the distance yeah we'll pull that down see and automatically your mountain gets lighter toward the bottom it mixes with the liquid white and all those things happen you don't have to worry about them shoot maybe that was so much fun maybe there's another one over here wherever you want them you can have another little thing it is right there pick up a little that color see there and that's super you can just worry a little paint from this mountain and make another one you can do anything in your world okay make that come right over just like so and it will blend it right down to nothing thanks and it gives us a nice base shape for a little Mountain nano that let's put some snow on that mountain so we go right into the titanium white pull it out very flat just as flat as you can get it really get tough with it and then cut across get that little roll of paint on the knife let's go right up here now but the point of the knife right it to pull your Mountain and just let it literally float right down the mountain a little bit more right in here and begin creating the shape of your mountain okay no pressure very very light maybe this one comes down like that delicate touch delicate touch and this is where you really really need to have a firm paint if you have a soupy paint you're going to become a mud mixer and we'll take a little that black and blue color mix it with some titanium white and make a shadow color out like it let me clean my knife here tell you what I'll get the small laughs for that it sneaks into those little places better okay let's go right up in here now then I want to just put the indication of some shadows here and there touch it pull it down just pull it down all kinds a happy little shadows look there we'll put one right in there wherever you think there should be a shadow that's where door to me over in here pull these down a little bit when you go back and pick up a little that dark and where the shadows are really deep look at their luck this see you can just spend all day just playing with mountains are so much fun when I was learning and practicing all the time I used to take a canvas and paint mountains from top to bottom from floor to ceiling on it then just scrape them off start over again you can never waste the Kansas you can clean it over and over and over and when your paints wet you can just take scrape it off take a little paint thinner wash it down use it again over and over if you paints dry you can take a little sandpaper sand off any bumps that you have cover it with a little liquid white and you're back in business again easy canvas never goes bad just paint right over okay let's play some more with that mountain a little bit of more of the white let's come right in here and maybe there's another little thing and he lives right there wherever you autumn you can just put a layer after layer so you can just keep going like I say do you cover up the whole canvas with mountains and that's one of the best ways that I know of to practice don't be afraid to to practice if there's a secret to this or to any style of painting it is practice just like tan yeshu first time you tried it it it wasn't so easy wasn't so easy now you can just you don't even have to look and you can do it of course I told that to a lady in class one day and she looked down she's how come you still wearing loafers there we go but I know you can look better than ice now a little bit of that dark just sort of play it here and there see how it sets that Frank's back in there and create some deep shadows super now back to our clean dry brush just tap that it creates all that mist hmm we got a tremendous big mountain here now maybe I'm just going to tap some of the same colors and let's begin doing this just tapping downward just let this sort of work right on out here very gentle maybe this just comes over and ends right there there we go beside all those little things just sort of happen see and you create another layer in your mountain you can just keep going on and on no there's no limit to it that's what makes it fun we've got a little highlight right in there now with a clean one-inch brush I'm going to grab this and make very short little strokes tiny little stroke quarter of an inch pipe strokes and just lift that up and it'll make it look like little trees that are growing right up the side of the mountain far far away too far to see any detail there we go little tiny strokes can't say that enough you let those strokes get too big you'll learn the illusion over here maybe there's some little little things going like so okay they will just fade that right out see how soft and gentle and that easy Chloe back covered up the whole canvas with mountains here but that's alright you learn how to make fun Mountain and you can make a thousand mountains and you can do it you can do anything alright alright let's just use this same old brush I'm gonna go right into some of this black and blue right here pick up a little a little of the white and just tap it in there so we have studying old colors black blue a little white can't screw it up here let's make a little footy hill same there he is just using the corner of the brush and he lives right there time's right hand down as each layer gets closer to you let it get a little bit darker a little bit darker clean dry 2 inch brush just tap the base we want to have missed in here just a little bit of mist there we go now then use the same old dirty brush same old color make it a little darker just tap it tell you what will had tiniest little bit of Van Dyck Brown when I start getting this a little closer okay let's go back up here and maybe there's another little Foothill that we can see oh there he is there he is you know he was there there he comes and he just goes right on up like yeah see how you can just create layer after layer and let's tap that one this little bit of mist is the only thing that we have in here to separate all these okay I'll tell you what let's add tiniest little bit of SAP green to that same color because it's getting closer now we're gonna begin to see more color let's go back here and maybe we'll have a footy Hill that comes right then look at that see and I'm just using just the corner of this old two-inch brush barely touching very touching clean dry two inch tap it give it a little upward pull we just got all kinds of things happening in there okay let me wash this brush so we'll have a clean I've got all my brushes dirty we have to splatter the cameraman err well to make sure he's awake I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyck Brown a little bit of dark Sienna just mix them on the brush here let's have some fun let's go right in here do this oh we just we just cover the whole canvas here all we're looking for here just some good dark color good base color that's like it that gives us a nice nice color to work with there okay now then just take the same old brush and I'm gonna go right into my CAD yellow a little bit of yellow ocher reach up here and grab some SAP green and I'm just going to tap this into the brush just tap it these yellows are a little bit thinner than the other colors so they they stick a little easier now let's go right in here see just touch if your color won't stick add a little bit of the liquid clear a little little paint thinner to it that'll thin it down so it'll stick or if you want your color to be brighter add a little bit of liquid white there we go now maybe maybe there's a yep another little thing it lives right there see there how you can just create layer after layer after layer there we are I tell you what let's have some fun let me find a little fan brush here Oh fan brush I'll take some some black some blue and SAP green take weave this mix up a bunch of that cuz we're gonna use it whoo that is a bunch it should look like just black blue SAP green there we go clean my knife off now with a fan brush just pull it right through there a lot of paint on the brush all right let's go up here maybe there's some happy little evergreens that live there he is and all we going to do it's just tap go back and forth like so see there there he is Darius let's give him a little friend you know me I think everybody has to have a friend friends are so important so important there that's one thing is so fantastic about painting for you on television I have to meet thousands and thousands of beautiful beautiful friends that I've never had if I hadn't done this and I thank you very much that's what makes this so special and then quickly get four happy little trees we'll take a little bit of the dark sienna and I'm just going to put just indication of a little trunk or two in here there we go see just tiniest little indication then with that brush it has the color on it I'm gonna go back in here and grab a little bit of that dark color just grab it at the corner of the brush and pull it down see there makes a shadow that easy and easy yeah then let's begin playing I'm gonna grab a little more the sap green and the yellows I got all the yellows going here Indian yellow yellow ocher CAD yellow just whatever okay yeah maybe maybe yep you're right there's another little hill right there so you can make as many of these as you want your or as few it's up to you it's up to you get a little bit of the bright red just a tiny little bit there we go hmm firecracker be pretty make another little hill they're okay if you wanted that to stand out a little brighter you can add a little bit of yellow it's either drop it right on top just Zing's all right I'm gonna get a one inch brush here let's pull that right through this dark color pull it through wiggle it wiggle it that brings it to a nice sharp point can't go back up here maybe there's a happy little evergreen ooh that's gonna be a happy big every take just the corner of the brush back and forth look at that see they live right there not one inch brush just like you're doing a fan brush or the 2 inch brush there we go just let him come right down we just killed my little tree there that's all right we know he's back here waiting oh he's there kill the mountain up there too I'm just undiscerning everything I did but as long as you learn how to do it that's what's so important just so you learned how to do it let's make out a little bit taller there we go there another happy little tree and down in here we could cure less just anywhere doesn't matter you separate these with highlights there's another one and in your world you decide how many trees you want about the ten trees maybe there's a whole forest there put them in every tree you do gives you that much more practice and the more practice you have the better your trees going to get here understad is in color understanding some color I can't let's put a tree on the other side we want one that side over there to be left out and feel lonely there he is right there alright big ol tree there see just letting fall right out of there yes and once again down in here we could really care less what's happening all we're looking for down here it's just nice dark color maybe yep you're right we'll have another happy little tree is right there we just let him work right on there and there's a nice bushy tree Liz right there I remember nice little tree shook that brush is too slow let's get er let's get a two inch brush here I just drop in some little things okay a little bit of the dark Sienna give us an indication of a tree trunk here and there wherever maybe there's even one in this bush over here same same I want to leave him out and you can just take the point of the map and straight sometimes I have little things in here there okay we just take the brush that has the yellow on it and SAP green load it full okay let's go right back up here now there Jun let's pop in a few little highlights on these trees don't let it get too light keep it quite dark evergreens are usually a little darker than other trees there we go and fantastic there these little trees back here I need a little touch to there this old tree he don't be left out little bit in there and that's enough to give us some indications ready tell you what let me get let's take some yellow a little bit of SAP green on the one-inch brush cut it in one direction let's put some happy little bushes right up in here there they are there they are look at all those little things all kinds of little bushes this is just yellow and green hmm these are the kind of paintings that really make you happy I had to touch a paint thinner to my paint there's so much paint here you need a very thin paint to get it to stick to all this there and put some shape and some form into your bush don't just don't just throw this up there at random think about it think like a bush there we go I think in one of the previous series I told the story about and as a kid my uncle told me if I wanted to catch a rabbit I stood behind should stand behind a tree and make a noise like a carrot when he came by grabbing me was to saying catch many rabbits ok back with a two inch brush into the color let's come right along in here and just tap in all kinds a little happy little grassy areas this is where the little bunny rabbit in to live he'd hide right up in here yeah that's where you'd live and just sort of bounce back and forth Vidia color like so let's go on the other side there it is you just cut it off wherever you want it look at that see it pushes everything back though and creates layer after layer and that's what makes your painting look deep and like it has a lot of distance we could have another rabbit over on this side okay rabbits everywhere in this in this woods all right tell you what catch that little rabbit that lives back here we need a we need a little path I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown little dark Santa with the old fan brush just pull it through there like so okay maybe the little path lives and just back and forth strokes see and you just put the little path wherever you want it just like so there he is look at that look at that and that quick you got a happy little path just sort of smoothing off I care well the point of the knife let's just go in here putting a few little sticks the old clock on the walls telling me I got to go to this time so I think we'll call this painting finished we wrap it up for this week from all of us here happy painting and God bless you you
