- Hi, certainly glad to see you today. Thought today, we'd do a
fantastic little painting. And I'm glad you're here and
gonna paint along with me. So I'll tell you what,
let's start out today and have 'em run all the
colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me. While they're doing that, let me show you what I've done up here 'cause we have something a
little bit different today. Let me explain what's happening here. Standard old 18 by 24 inch canvas, but you use any size that you want. And I've taken black gesso, and I have an idea in my mind today and I thought I'd do a little waterfall. So I've just painted
this with black gesso, and I've even put in a basic indication of where my little waterfall
will be and let that dry. Then I've taken a little
bit of liquid clear and covered the entire canvas. The liquid clear is there only to make the next layer go on easier. Now while the liquid clear is still wet, I've covered the entire
canvas with a thin, very thin coat of alizarin
crimson and phthalo blue to make a lavender, sort
of to the bluish side. And with that, we're gonna do
a fantastic little waterfall. So I hope you enjoy this one. Shoot, let's start out today, we'll use this little
tiny two inch brush here. We'll go right into some titanium white. I like these kinds of paintings
because they work so nice. This black gesso is the most fantastic
thing you've ever seen. We'll put a little of that white on there, let's go up here. Now maybe our light source
is gonna be right up here above the waterfall, so take the white. Now there's very little color up here. But clear allows you to put
just a, almost like a glaze. There's not a great deal of color. If you don't have the clear on there, you end up putting so much paint that when you put white
on there, it turns, color's too strong. Anyway, watch here though, because it's such a small amount of paint, I want to create the illusion of a light shining through here, and by just taking a little
of that titanium white, and making little crisscross
strokes, we can do that. Very little color on the canvas. And you can do this several times to achieve a desired
lightness if you wanted to. If you wanted this to be
brighter, well, I'll show you. Take a little more white. Maybe you want to be a little
brighter right in here. You can add a little more white in there. There. You see, it already, it
looks like there's light just exploding through there. And it's a beautiful,
beautiful way to make some very interesting paintings. And you can pull it a little if you want, and really make it look like
a light ray's zinging through. There's no limit to this. There we go. Alright, so we have our light source now. Now without even cleaning the brush, I'll just go right back into
that lavender color I was using to cover the canvas with. Alizarin crimson, and phthalo blue, much more crimson than blue, though. But it's still to the bluish side. The blue is so much
stronger than the crimson. We'll just tap a little
color onto the brush here. And it still has the white
on it that we just used. So it's a little lighter. Okay, let's go up in here. Now and maybe back in here, we have all kind of little
tree shapes and stuff, so let's just start
thinking about little trees that live way back here. We don't want these to be too dark yet. We want these to be very
subdued, very quiet. 'Cause they're right in that strong light that's coming through there. So all we're looking for here, initially, is very basic little shapes
of some happy little trees that live back in here. There we go. But very, very basic little shapes. Maybe there's a few more
little things living in here, wherever you think they should be is exactly where they should be. Just sort of let your
imagination just go wild. That's what's so fantastic about painting, you can create any kind
of world that you want. See, already, it gives you an impression of limbs hanging over there. Now then, shoot, I'll just
use that same old brush. I'm lazy, I don't want to clean it. Take a little bit of the
titanium white on there and we'll put a few little
highlights on some of these that are far back in here. The light's zinging through here, these are gonna be very light, and bright. There they go. See, and begin thinking
about shape and form. There. Now then, maybe as we
work a little closer, tell you what, let's begin picking out a few little tree limbs and little sticks and twigs that live in there. So we'll take some paint
thinner on our liner brush and go into that same identical color. Thinking about trunks and sticks. There. If you have trouble making this flow, add a little bit more of the
paint thinner, that's all. That's all. Okay, see that, you can make as many or as few as you want in your world. Wherever you think there should
be a little stick or a twig, that's where you want it. And this paint should flow just as easy, almost like you were
using a pen and writing. If it doesn't flow like that, chances are you don't have quite enough thinner on your brush. We'll take a little more
of that titanium white, a little more of that lavender color, now we can come back in here and let's begin picking out
little individual clumps of things that live on these trees, little tiny things. See 'em? There. Wherever you think they should be, darker, darker, darker
over here in the left 'cause not as much light's
gonna strike over there. It takes very little paint to do this particular part, very little. Maybe, there, let's add
a little more color. Maybe right down in
here, there's some things that just sort of, maybe they just sort of hang over like this, I don't know. Just sort of let your
brush take you there. Maybe things right down-- I don't know, I really don't know. You can just sort of pick
out all these little things that you like in here, and just begin working
with shapes and forms. And let all these little things happen. Think about all the little
creatures that live out here, little squirrels and bunny rabbits, and just hundreds and thousands of little things living here. There. Okay, there's another one. Alright, but already, you
have so many layers there, they create the illusion
of depth and distance in your painting. Maybe, oh, there's a nice one. Looking for some nice
individual shapes in there. There. Okay, now then. Tell you what, I'll just
take a fan brush here. Shoot, we'll take a little
bit of that same color and maybe back in here you can just, this should be almost
identically the same color as what you have up there. Just want to put the indication of some things way back in there that you just barely can see. They're far away, and all we're doing is just tapping in some basic little shapes. Now then, probably the
most fun thing to do here is the waterfall of course, so let's do that. Let's do that, we'll
take a one inch brush. I'm gonna dip it into a little
bit of the liquid clear, just a small amount, just a small amount. We'll go through some titanium white. Now the clear in there is only to thin it, it's only to thin it. Alright, in fact I may put a little more. Let me dip the brush into
it just a tiny bit more. There, alright, that's nice. You can feel it, when
you pull the brush across it should be slick. You can reach up and get
the least little touch of phthalo blue, least
little touch though. Whisper, whisper. Okay, let's go up in here. Now if our waterfall lives right here, let the water sort of come along like this and then fall, just let it fall. See there? Just let it go. There, I'm gonna add a
touch more blue to that. I want it just a little
more to the blue side. Oh, that's nice, that's nice. I hope you can see what
a difference that makes. There. Now we can take a clean two inch brush and from the bottom, lift
upward and smooth that and blend it until it's
just as smooth as glass. That clear will allow you
to just make it so smooth and maybe down here toward the base, maybe there's some mist. We'll just take a little white
paint, very small amount, right on the tip of the brush, and let's just put the indication here of a little foam. If water falls that far,
you're gonna have mist that's floating around here. Just no way you can get away from it. Water falls that far, you're
certainly gonna have mist. There. Already, that sort of looks like it's laying in a little cloud almost. That's what we're looking for. Alright. Now then. Maybe, tell you what, maybe in our world, maybe there's a nice tree
over here on this side. But you start with the thing
that's the furthest away, and you work forward. So let's take a little dark sienna, I'll reach over here
and get a little white, thin it down a little. We'll use the liner brush. A little bit more of the dark sienna. Okay, let's go up here. Maybe there's a little tree trunk that lives right in here. And just wiggle that birch, turn it as you let it come down so you get all those
fantastic little shapes. It's not just a future
telephone pole living here, this tree has form and shape, character. He's a nice tree, very nice little tree. There he is. Okay, now, maybe over here, there's not as much light striking. Let's use that same old
brush since I'm lazy, take a little sap green, a
little bit of cad yellow, reach up here and grab
a little midnight black, that'll, oh, there. Makes a beautiful dark green. Push that brush, load
that little ridge of paint right out on the edge of the bristle. That's an excellent shot
there, you can really see that. Okay, let's go up here. Now then, I want to have nice leafy things that are hanging right over here. Just begin with a corner of the brush and then again, creating this illusion. This is what's so fantastic about having the black gesso on there. Automatically, this just happens 'cause you have your dark
color underneath already. You could do this on a white canvas, but you, oh you'd work yourself to death trying to get that much dark in there. See, and here, the black gesso puts that all in there for you. There. Okay, maybe back in here, there's some things,
they're a little darker, they hide way back in here. Now on black canvas, color shows up so much stronger than it
does on a white canvas. So be careful that you
don't get carried away. Oh this gets working so nicely, and it feels good, and
next thing you know, you've covered up your whole canvas. There, and you want to retain
some of these dark areas here, makes it look deep and
secretive, mysterious. Just all kinds of little happy
things going on in there. But just think about form and shape and all the little
limbs that live in there that create all these illusions. Most important, just don't
throw it on at random. It won't look right and you'll be unhappy. And I want this to work for you. Take a little knife here. And we'll use some, we'll
take a little Vandyke brown, maybe mix a little dark sienna with it. Now we need some land over on
this side of the waterfall. See here? That'll help push that waterfall back 'cause it's just brown, both browns. There. See, just let this work right on down. Even if you can't see it, it's there. It's there. We're putting a dark color on there. There we go. And we can take the least
little touch of titanium white mixed with those same brown colors, same old brown colors, a little Vandyke, a little dark sienna. Mix it to just a marbled appearance. Don't overmix it, and then start up here and we can create the
illusion of a little, here's a little cliff right here. A little place where the
bunny rabbit can run around and get him a drink out of that waterfall. Of course if he's not
careful, he slips in there, gon' have rabbit stew. Now then, just basically clean that, grab the edge of that, and allow a little touch of that color, just a small little touch of
that color to be pulled down. Just a very, very small amount. It'll create that illusion
of big cliffs here. There. Now maybe, maybe in our waterfall, maybe there's all kind
of little grassy things that live right up here on the top. Shoot, I'll tell you what, maybe some of our little grassy
things start right in here. Just use the corner of the brush, maybe there's all kind
of little ferns and stuff that just sort of hang off there. If you have this much mist, chances are you're gonna have
a lot of beautiful plants that just sort of hang
off the edges of these and grow everywhere. There we go. Here's some over here. Wherever, wherever. Just sort of think in your mind where you believe all these
little things would grow. There. Maybe they come right on down. Here and there, we can
have a little brown. Maybe there's a little
stone that lives there. There we go. Take a little touch of
color, just let it graze. Most delicate touch, a little
bit of color on top of this to give that rock some shape and form. Not much though, not much. Now then, you can come right back and just hang some of
your little grassy areas right over it, right over it. Maybe there's a few back here in the mist, but we can't see a lot
of 'em because the mist is beginning to cover 'em. There we are. Look at all them little rascals. But just do this in layers. Think about what's furthest
away and work forward. Forward, forward. Maybe there's another big stone
that lives right down here. Little brown, take a
little brown and white, and see, just put a little
highlight on that stone. Then we come back, hang some grass right over the top of that, let that disappear right back in there. There, see isn't that easy? We've got quite an
effective little area here. Scratching in a few
little sticks and twigs, let all those things happen. Maybe, watch here, watch
here, I see something here. Let's do it this way. Take a little white on our brush, decide where you think the water will be. Grab it and pull it straight down, a little titanium white on the brush. Right under this stone
here, just pull it down. But it's important that
this comes straight down. There, even if you turn your
brush at that kind of angle, you still want to go straight down. There we are. Maybe it comes over here somewhere, we don't know yet, where we want to go. See, it's picking up that
color that's underneath, and all these things,
these beautiful colors will just happen automatically. Very lightly go across, just enough to distort it a little bit. way back in here. There. See, and that easy, you
have the illusion of water. Now then, you ready to get crazy? Tell you what, let's take
a little Vandyke brown, a little dark sienna, mix it together. Maybe there's a big cliff. Let's come right down in here. Maybe there's a big cliff
that lives right in there. Just sort of make a decision. Maybe it comes... Gotta make those little noises though. Just put a little brown here
and there on the canvas, so when we hit it with a little touch of the brown and white, it'll highlight, it'll jump right out at you. Look at that. See. There we go, a little touch right there. But very, very little paint. It just, it looks like there's more paint here
than there really is. The reason it looks like
that is because once again, color stands out so strongly against the black canvas, so strong. I'm going back to my brushes again. Little grassy colors on it. Now if our cliff lives right in here, let's just begin putting some
of the little grassy things that live right here on our cliff. So let 'em fall right on down, just follow the basic angle there. See there. Sort of fill it in, but leave some of your little rocky
areas there show through. Don't kill 'em all. There we go. Now here's another little trick, see. If you want to push that waterfall back, let this come over it. Look at there. And instantly, instantly
it'll push that waterfall back into the painting, and now it's back in a, it's in a secret little place back here. There we go. This is a place that
the tourists never see. It just hides in there. There we are. Wherever you think they should live. Okay, isn't that fantastic? But these little grassy areas
are what make it so nice. Maybe these come all the
way down in the water. Maybe they even hang in
the water a little bit. That's alright, too. Now sometimes it's nice to take and grab just a touch of those and pull them down into the water, let 'em reflect, just let 'em reflect. A little touch there will really excite. I want to touch a little bit
of phthalo blue here and there, just the tiniest little bit, just enough to make it stand out a little. Beautiful. Now then, maybe there's a big
tree that lives right there. So for that, we'll go back
to the same lavender color that we covered the canvas with. And maybe our big tree hangs over here. So all we're doing here
is creating layers. Each layer creates more
depth in the painting, makes it look deeper. And to me, that's what makes
a painting interesting, that it has depth and distance. It's not just a flat subject. It has dimension, there we go. Okay, maybe that comes right on down. Just sort of make a
decision where you think your big old tree would
live here, and drop it in. That's all there is to it. Probably doesn't look
like much at this point, but it's there, it's there. We're gonna take liner brush, a little bit of Vandyke
brown, a little white, all those colors, mix it with paint thinner
so it's very thin, very thin, quite dark, and get a little dark sienna there, too. There, that's better. Now then, we got a few little limbs that are showing through here. But keep these quite dark. We don't want 'em to get too light. If they do, they won't look exactly right. There, and when you're painting these, you might even think that
they were not gonna show, but they will, people will see 'em. They will see 'em. Course, as we've mentioned before, I know nobody's interested
in that happy buck, but if you should be, these black canvases are some of the best selling
paintings that you can do. People will love 'em. Absolutely love 'em. Now then, clean that old brush. Let's take, back to my
brush with the greens on it, I want to add some black. I want this to be a much
darker green, much darker. I'm gonna tap a little
color into the brush, now let's go up in here, and let's begin putting
in some shapes there. See there? Now once again, if you have
trouble making your paint stick, add the least little touch
of the paint thinner, least little touch, though. Don't get crazy 'cause very
quickly it'll get too much and then you can't control it, it'll just run all over the place. And think about how
these limbs would hang. Especially in this kind of
area with all that water there. These would probably
be big old saggy trees. There. Sort of, maybe sort of
tropical type trees. Darker and darker back over in this area. Don't let 'em get too bright. There. Once again, I know you
get tired of hearing it, but think about form here. Don't just hit at random. Think about form. There's all kinds of little
things that live in here. There's little limbs that
protrude out this way, that's what these are hanging on. There. And sometimes maybe they
hang over like that. However you want 'em. And when you start doing this, you'll see all kinds of things happening. Don't just try to copy. Don't just try to copy. Now we're trying to teach
you a technique here. So when you do your home painting, sort of look at it. You're gonna see hundreds of
things that are happening. Your painting will probably come out much better than this one. But don't just try to copy. There. That's the reason we don't trace anything or start out with patterns here because it's more of an individual thing, if you do your own thing. We each see nature through different eyes. We each have our own idea
of how things should look. And the way I think things should look may not necessarily be the way
you think things should look. So let your imagination take
you where you want to go. Don't just depend on somebody
else to take you there 'cause you can do it. Maybe there's a little bank here so we can stand on the lookout here. Let's just drop in, just using
some of that lavender color, we'll just put in a happy
little bank right there. I just put the dark in
there just to form an edge so we have dark in there, underneath this. Now we can come back and we can create all kinds of little things. There. Shoot. Now if you want to show depth under these, leave a little dark area
underneath those bushes 'cause that's where the
little creature would hide. And you know what, maybe
there's a little stone that lives right there. Put a little brown, take a
little brown and white... There, we'll just create us a, just a happy little stone
that lives out here. He watches all this water play and fall. There. Something like so. There we are, now then. Let's take, I'm still using
the little small knife. I like it. I'm gonna take the least little
bit of color on the knife, almost none, and very firmly, just scrape in some little
things here and there. Just to bring that together. Clean up those edges around
the stones and everything. There. Not a great deal though. Little bit out in here. See there? Look at that little bit of
blue that's right there. Doesn't that shine, though? But when you do this, use it sparingly. Use it sparingly, that's
what makes it so impressive is there's such a small
amount of it there. If you had a lot, it
would lose its effect. So that's a little treasure, hang onto it. There we are, just a few
little ripples here and there. And take our liner brush, a little bit of the brown and the white, there we go, and maybe here and there, we can pick out a little
stick that lives in there, few little things that hang over. Wherever you think they should be. You see these sticking out when you're looking at
the woods and stuff. But wherever you think they should be. I think we're about
ready to sign that one, looks finished. Take a little thinner, a
little bit of the bright red, and let's sign it right down here. There we are. Luckily I have a very short
name, so it only takes a second. There we are. And I hope you've enjoyed this one. It's a little bit different, it'll give you some
experience with a black gesso, and you can do a fantastic painting. It'll make you feel good in here. From all of us here, I'd love
to wish you happy painting. God bless, my friend. (elevator music)
