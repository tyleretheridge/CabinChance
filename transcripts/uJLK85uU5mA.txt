hi certainly glad you could join us today thought today would just do a fun little painting so let's start out and hammer on all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us while they're doing that let me show you what I get going up here standard old 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched canvas but you use whatever size is convenient today I've taken and I put a little bit of just masking tape around the edges underneath here and I covered the edges with a little bit of black gesso then I've just got some paper here to keep to keep from painting on the black gesso and we pull that out we'll have a black border it goes all around this painting inside here I've just covered the entire canvas with a very thin even coat of the liquid white as we normally do and from there let's just make something that's bright and shiny has a lot of color it's a fantastic day here and I hope it is wherever you're at so let's start let's start they maybe lose just a touch of the Indian yellow that's a very bright nice yellow a little bit on the 2 inch brush and let's do something it looks like let's go right up there something looks like maybe a big sun shining through there I don't know let's just start off and have some fun there now if you can do that you can paint the rest of this paintings so let's to it I'm Guerette into without cleaning the brush a little bit of CAD yellow and we'll just put that right around the edge next color I'll use little yellow ochre I'm not cleaning the brush in between these colors because I want them to mix anyway just a little yellow ochre there we go now and then I'm sort of putting this on the little crisscross strokes because it gives you little fuzzy edges that are much easier to blend together an old harsh line something like that now then I'm going to mix up on orange and for that I'll use a little kid yell a little the bright red I want to make a nice orange color something like so let me clean off the old knife we just wipe the knife off paper towel still haven't cleaned the brush I'm going right into that nice orange color just bring it right on around there's gonna be a firecracker the hair I like these nice colors you get if you do a painting with these colors our tape it will certainly brighten up a dull room there we go something about like that all right still haven't cleaned the brush and we're just allowing these colors to blend together over here on the edges okay just straight straight bright red now we're going to get we're going to get into some beautiful colors right there so we have color on the brush and we have color on the canvas and is liquid white under all of it so it's continually mixing none of its going to end up as pure color okay yeah then still without cleaning the brush go into dark Sienna still hadn't cleaned the brush and we'll just bring that right around the edge writer an edge just like so just plain old dark Sienna something about laquetta once again these little crisscross strokes certainly make blending much much easier little more the dark Sienna put right up in here I want that little corner left out okay we have a little hole left in the sky up there we'll use just straight old Van Dyck Brown right in there alright and that's basically all we're going to put in the sky as far as color goes Navin let's do the most fun thing in the whole technique wash the old brush that's that's really where you take out your frustrations and your hostilities shake off excess paint thinner and just beat the devil out of it there we go now I'm just going to take a clean brush dry as I can get it and begin blending this just blend it blend it blend it blend it you want to blend it until you can't tell where one color starts and the next color stops just work it and work it work it and when you're doing this I would recommend that you sort of step back to me canvas and take a look see every once in a while when you're as close to it as I am it's very difficult to tell what something looks like stiff back take a look see there and then you can really tell what you have in your world okay now then like I'll wash the brush again I just look for excuses to wash the old brush now I want this to be even brighter so I say it's a fantastic day and everybody here is feeling good and I think we'll just we'll just make something that's oh it's shiny so I'm gonna take straight titanium white start right here in the light area and begin blending outward it'll mix with all those beautiful colors and it'll come brighter and brighter and you can do this several times several times I recommend you at least wipe your brush between each color or even better clean it in the sake of time here I'm just going back and not cleaning it but I am wiping it in between there we go boy that rascal will shine now look at there we just go across to sort of take out the brushstrokes just blend everything together something about like it okay down here I won't have some water you know me I'm I love water so we'll just take a little yellow and put right in here okay a lovely little touch of the yellow ochre just reflect a little of that color into the water little bright red doesn't much matter there maybe even a little little touch of the dark see in just the basic colors that we had in the sky a little more the dark Santa right there something about like yet and a little bit of Van Dyck the Van Dyck Brown ball makes the edge is darker helps helps lead to eye into the light area okay and then wash the old brush again and we can blend that out this is a good one if nothing else it'll teach you how to wash the brush there I must admit I just I just really like to do that so here we go okay now we just blend it out a little bit and as we decide what's in the foreground here then we can we can add or subtract doesn't matter right at this point we're just we're just worried about a sky and putting some color down here where we know water is going to be alright I guess now we have to start making some big decisions in our world maybe you find a little fan brush maybe we back in the background here let's take a little bit of dark Sienna put a little white in it a little wine in it maybe the least little touch of the bright red something like so just make it a nice color like that let me wipe off the knife there I will put a little bit on our little fan brush she just loaded up you can use number three or the number six fan brush it didn't matter go right up in here maybe there's a well maybe there's a little maybe this little island back here what the heck make up little dis little ideas I didn't matter just want to show the indication of something that's far far away back here far away there we're not looking for a lot of detail but now we want to have a reflection so we'll put a little bit that color down to take our old brush Oh 2 inch brush grab then give it a little downward pull to go across gives us some instant reflections under there and take a little bit of liquid white put it on the pallet leaves little touch leaves little touch of the bright red into it just to give it a little a little pinkish taste cut across get our little bit of paint Liz right on the edge of the knife there and we can go up and we'll just cut in a happy little water line just a little separator just a little separator here if you ever do water line it you think is too bright just clean your knife and go back and rub it and it'll go away it'll go well you can rub it too it just totally disappears if you want to up to you that work pretty good it works good let's do it again take that same color except I'm going to add a little more of the darks in and maybe a little Van Dyke Brown to it want to darken it slightly as things get closer to you in a landscape they should get a little darker okay yeah maybe maybe there's another little little doer a little Peninsula whatever sticks right out here this might be maybe it's a half of another little olive I don't know don't know it's your world you decide what it is just lift upward make it look like little distant trees and stuff that are growing back here pull down once again we need that reflection if you ever paint a little projection onto the water like this and it doesn't look right it looks like it's floating on top of the water we above it chances are it just needs a reflection underneath it that reflection causes it to set down into the water there come across once again our little little reflection or come back in here take a little bit of that liquid white that we had and we'll put another happy little water line right in there and you could make as many as these little these little islands or projections or peninsulas whatever you wouldn't call them as you want or as few maybe don't want any it's up to you up to you there's total freedom on this canvas here you can do anything that you want to do anything that you want to do alright shoot you know what maybe there's some more there it's our world and we can do it if we want to use it same color only a little darker I'm put a little lizard crimson in it now little crimson that's nice I like that color so it's just basically the two Browns alizarin crimson little white let me wipe off the knife we'll just keep using this old fan brush it's working pretty good so if it's working it's my father used to say if it ain't broke don't fix it alright and it's not broke let's go back up here maybe there's a big group of big one like this only big it's closer so we'll use the brush this way and just tap down you know I got a little piece of film on to show you today it's so fantastic you know I love I love animals and I worked with animals all over the country I'm just going to be doing this while we're looking and animals have a special affection for children and my young friends loved animals this is my friend Paul and he lives right outside of Orlando and his grandmother is Carmen Shaw who's one of the animal rehab people this young man he is so cute and this little baby rat COO he has here hidden he precious Paul an asset and talked for quite a while and and he told me a lot about animals this this young fella since his grandmother has worked with animals for many years he's grown up literally around these animals he knows more about animals probably and I do and he has a special thing he's inherited his grandmother's well I don't know I think I think animals know when people really like them and they trust him and this young fella has that but in he cute so you call them do it just putting up some indications here some trees I want a little more detail than these that I had back here so I'm using the brush this way sort of vertical now then I need some mist in there we'll just take a clean brush two inch brush and tap and tap you could even you could even put a little touch of white paint or a little white but maybe even a little yellow on your brush okay let's do it let's do it man it's easier to show take a little CAD yellow a little white and you could tap that in two crea create a nice and misty effect back here see how it looks like Miss Lee in there over it and then gently lift up it just takes out the little tap marks and sort of blends it together and it once again as you know we want to set in the water we have to put a little reflection under here you have to decide where it lives and put a reflection go across there and that neat I think all right think we grab another fan brush I have several of them going here I think maybe we need some trees that are even closer but putting all these layers in your painting or planes as they're called it helps create that illusion of depth and distance in your world I'm just using straight Van Dyck dark sienna and alizarin crimson and we're just mixing them together here like that maybe a little more crimson all I get a little red as you can wipe off this all knife just clean off now once again back the old fan brush loaded full of color a lot of paint a lot of paint don't be afraid of getting too much color in there don't think you can do that let's go up in here maybe in our world there's a big strong tree that lives right there notice that this tree is darker in color than the one behind it so it stands out now there there he is there he is I lives right there he's got a friend right there even trees need friends and it's rare that you find just one tree growing in there yeah usually usually there's several little trees you know how it goes trees get together and pretty soon there's a whole mess of little trees that's what makes them wonderful we'll just let them get a little smaller so it helps create that illusion of going down downhill there a little bit maybe this one's a little bigger don't have each one I'm progressively getting smaller or progressively getting bigger because trees do not follow the rules like we do they grow however makes them happy however makes them happy it's like a lot of times in art we're told that you have to have odd numbers of things now artistically that looks better there's no question about that looks much better but in nature nobody ever told the trees that rule so if you're painting a scene from nature and you want to have an even number of trees it's your world you can do whatever you want I will just take a little dart that dark color just put the indication here and there of a little trunk it's the same exact color but it shows up a few little trees and stuff and then when we got that old color going I'm just going to add a little tiny bit of yellow ochre right on there just come back in here here and there and there in here we don't want much a few little indications of some highlights I want to keep his dark real dark because that's what makes it stand out from the what's behind it maybe I just take Hill fan brush that's working pretty good maybe there's just a nice little grassy area it was right underneath the trees just push up a little dark color the dark colors there only saw a light will show you can't have light unless you have dark dark is what makes it show just like in life you can't you can't appreciate the good times unless you have a few bad ones that's what makes us appreciate the good times when they happen their few little reflections for cross something like n that's all we need tell you what tell you on maybe in our world maybe let me clean off my knife here maybe we back in the distance there and we'll use a small knife maybe their lives not take one don't do something else first change my mind and it's our world we can do that I want to put a little highlight on that grassy area use a little yellow ochre a little Indian yellow maybe a little touch of the bright red nine there that flattens it out makes it look more like yourself like a little flat area I think it looks a little better don't you tear now then back to our little knife maybe back here in our world maybe there's just a little tiny we can see we back a little tiny house I was raised I'm using a small knife there's his little roof to go in a lot of detail he's too far away it's a threat out there in the edge of this gorgeous place we'll put a few little grassy areas right around his foots that's where I want to lives right next to that water I love water I've always wanted out to have a home right on the water and maybe one day I will there but just a little highlight on the roof just enough to make him Sparkle a little bit and I don't want that little house to get lonely tell you what maybe come right up in here maybe there's one that lives right here too he's a little closer so he'll look a little bigger there and we look at as many or as few as we want in our world maybe this one actually out in the water babies on stilts maybe this is a little fishing village maybe we just keep making up things here will have a will have a whole whole group of thing I don't know you just sort of let these things happen okay you want a village there's another one how many's in our village I don't know I'm just putting in some dark areas maybe sure maybe there's another one there doesn't matter because in your world you can do anything that you want to do just all kinds of little things we take a little quiet little brown little little bit of the Lisbon crimson yellow ochre just mix them together on some some nice colors oh that's coming up but I want to leave a marble so we put little highlights on the roofs I guess that's a word roofs more than one roof it'll separate them just a little but all kinds of little variations going on in there we'll take some white and just black just midnight blacks make a nice gray color maybe some of them are gray appear well I get we can take the white gray all those colors just mix them together put all kinds of little sides on there come back with just a touch of color maybe you make out a little window indication here and there these are too far away to have a lot of detail so don't worry about them don't worry about maybe we said this maybe these were a little still so we'll put the indication here and there are some little stills that they're standing on see they're just indications once again too far away to worry about a great deal of detail there now that I want to reflect those stilts into the water so I just grab them pull them down and that easy that easy take a little bit of the liquid height and just make a little ripple here and there juh nice little ripples tell you what let's get crazy maybe right here who I won't go right over the top of that that's all right we'll just go right over this is a bigger one it lives right here this was sort of looking more toward us something about my kid come back with our highlight color a little edge right there little indication there go right down in here there maybe there's a little walkway around I don't know make up little things it's out in the water he's got a head where you walk around a little building maybe there's a little door how about a little window we can do that too sorry well a little highlight around there little do I use this little few little little post-its stick down in the water like that I come a little longer than then they actually should be because we're going to pull some of them down turn it into reflections see - then just go across just enough to wiggle it there come on I can't just enough to put some of the ripples here and there now let's grab a no 1 inch brush I won't go into the browns crimson little black whatever maybe you want to touch it oppression blue don't want much a blue though just a little blue just a darknet maybe there's some bushes that live right here just throw me out least a little bit of blue now at least a little bit all kinds of little things live right there take that same brush we went to some yellow ochre and in yellow CAD yellow just get some nice yellow put a few little highlights on these bushes I use these colors a little red too just cuz they sort of match this guy keeps everything together there just a few little bushes live here maybe maybe even there's a few post out here there's another one there's one where you want maybe one of them over here on a small posted or still hanging around a little bit of that brown and white touch give it a little pull something like so little bit of paint thinner maybe maybe there's still indication of small maybe there's some wires out here I don't know whatever you'd like for the bee most of them are broke down but there's still a few here and there they're in here and we have that old color pull up a fuel weeds and sticks there something I can now then let's see if we can let's take this off and see what we got I'm just gonna leave the pallet down I had a little paper here just to keep the black from getting messed up would take that off and then let's come in here take off just lay our tape it sort of gives us a nice border that goes all the way around the painting there just something like so this is just plain ordinary old masking tape nothing big we didn't that neat I like these little things done like that now watch watch in our world there's one more post and it lives right out here something like so imma let it come right into the white so it shows up good a little bit of highlight color it just work right around like it take our little fan brush a little dark right in there so it's just a little bit of the yellow ochre Indian yellow put a few little highlights on that rascal something about my Ken just to make it look like a little grassy areas extra liner brush and let's take maybe this piece of wire here and bring it right on out just like so so it looks like it projects right on out of the paint did that neat I think you'll like this one give it a try send me a photo of your attempt I'd love to see it from all of us here like to wish you happy painting and god bless my friend you
