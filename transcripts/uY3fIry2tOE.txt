- Hello, I'm Bob Ross, and I'd like to welcome you to
the 18th Joy of Painting series. First of all, let me thank
you for inviting me back for another series of painting
shows. And if this is your first time
with us, allow me to extend a personal
invitation for you to drag out your big
brushes and a few colors and paint
along with us each week as we put some of nature's
masterpieces on canvas. Tell you what, I'm gonna start
out today and have 'em run all the
color across the screen that you need to paint along
with me. And while they're doing
that, let me tell you what I've already done up here. Today I have my standard old 18
by 24 inch double-primed canvas, and onto
that, I've taken a piece of
contact paper and sort of cut like a half an oval shape, and I just stuck it on. And we've covered the entire
canvas with a thin, even coat of liquid
white. This is a wet-on-wet painting
technique, so then what normally the
first thing that we'll do is we cover the canvas with
something to make it wet and slick. Today we've used liquid white, and all that does is allow
us to actually blend color right on the canvas rather
than working ourselves to death on the palette. Tell you what, let's go
ahead and get started. Today let's start off with
the old two-inch brush, and let's go right up here and
get this least little amount of phthalo blue, it's a very
strong color, you need very little, just pull
it out, and then tap the bristles into
the color. That assures that we get
a nice, even distribution of color all the way through the
bristles. And that's exactly what we're
looking for. Okay, let's go right up here. Thought today we'd do
just a happy little scene. I wanna show you a very
simple little scene that you can do even if
you've never painted before. This is a very easy,
very nice little scene, and I think you'll find it
very enjoyable and rewarding. There we go, all we're
doing here is just using little crisscross strokes,
little x's. That's really all it
amounts to, little tiny x's. And the color, the blue
color, is always blending with the liquid white
that's on the canvas. And automatically, automatically
the sky gets lighter and lighter toward the horizon. And that's what we're
looking for in a landscape. We just blend it together here a
little. Okay, then very lightly
we can just go across. All this does is just
removes all the brush strokes and sorta pulls everything
together just like so. There. Maybe we'll have a little bit
of water in this painting. If you've painted with me
before, you know I'm an absolute nut for water. I think it's so beautiful,
and in this technique, it's one of the nicest,
easiest things to paint. So you'll find water very
enjoyable to do. So we'll just take a small
amount of that phthalo blue
again back on the same old brush. Let's go right up here, and you
have to make a decision here,
where does your water live? Maybe... maybe it's right in
here, just take and pull from the outside in. That's all there is to it. Very lightly. Now then, we'll take it
up to, oh, about there. Doesn't matter, doesn't
matter, wherever you want it. On this piece of canvas, you
have absolute and total power. You can do anything
that you wanna do here. You have unbelievable power. You can move mighty rivers, push trees around, and
mountains. Anything that you want to
do on this piece of canvas. There, okay, and that'll
end up being our water. Let's wash our old brush. We wash our brush with odorless
thinner. Let me say that again, odorless
thinner. If you don't use odorless
thinner, you're gonna find yourself, (banging) (chuckling) you're gonna
find yourself working alone very, very quickly. Really recommend you use
odorless thinner. Tell you what, let's
take a fan brush today, and let's build us a happy
little cloud. And for that, we'll go
right into titanium white. Be right back, gonna get
the least little touch of the bright red, least,
least little touch, though. It goes a long way. Load a lot of color into the
bristles. See, both sides are full of
color. Very good, now then, we have
to make some big decision. Maybe there's some happy little
clouds that live in our world, so
take the corner of the brush and very gently begin making
all these tiny little circles. Tiny little circles,
add a little more paint. There we go. And just begin forming
your basic cloud shapes. That's all we're looking
for at this point are very basic little shapes. It's all we're looking for. Okay, just apply a little color. Now then, I'm gonna take a
two-inch brush that's nice and clean and dry, and I have several of
each brush going here. And very gently, very
gently, just blend the base of this mountain, or cloud. Son of a gun, I done
called this a mountain. There we are, now, very lightly, lift upward. See, that just sort of fluffs
it. Then gently, gently,
two hairs and some air, just blend it a little bit, and we have a cloud. Now when you're painting
clouds, work in layers doing the cloud that you
think's the farthest away first. And then we'll come back
and reload the brush, and we can go back in
here and make another one. Now sometimes we use a very firm
paint. Sometimes you'll find the paint
maybe is a little too thick. If that ever happens, add
the least little touch of liquid white along
with the titanium white. Least little amount because
when you add liquid white here, your blending ability drops
drastically. So don't add any more than you
have to to get the paint to come off
your brush onto the canvas. And we can put another happy
little cloud that lives right here. And in your world, you have
to make these decisions. You have to decide how many
clouds live in your painting. There, see, I think there's
one lives right there. Right there, maybe up in here
there's a little stringy one. It just sorta floats
along, he just lays up here and has a good time,
watches everything happen. Now then, back to our
clean, dry two-inch brush, and be sure it's dry. It really needs to be dry. Blend the base of it, fluff
it just like we did before. And that easy, you have
another happy little cloud. And you can put as many or as
few as you want in your world. Maybe we'll do one more,
it's good practice. Good practice, and the more you
practice, the better you get, no
matter what you're doing, whether it's painting or
anything else. But if there's a secret to this or any other style of
painting, it's simply practice. There we go, now very gently,
once again, we just wanna blend the
base of this, just the base. Lift it, fluff it, there. Very lightly, very
lightly, just go across. And so now see, we have all
these layers of clouds now. And you can come along
in here and, you know, maybe once again, maybe you
wanna put some little stringy clouds in
here, little floaters. And those are very
easy, all you have to do is just sorta lay 'em in. Blend 'em the least little
amount. And then very lightly just go
over 'em. Isn't that something? Okay, maybe we'll have a little
mountain that lives way, way back
in the distance here. Very simple little mountain, one
that's very quiet, very subdued. We'll take some black,
a little van dyke brown, little touch of alizarin crimson
in there. Like so. Maybe the least little touch
of prussian blue, there. Okay, now then pull the paint
out as flat as you can get it. Really get tough with it. Go down with the knife, touch, and just cut
across, that way you get a small roll of paint, lives
right on the edge of the knife. Okay, let's go up here. Now then, we have to make a big
decision. Where does our little mountain
live? And we want this to be a far
away, very distant little mountain. So we don't want it to get too
big on us. These rascals will grow
on you very quickly. They'll take over your whole
world. And you have to make some
decisions, where you want little bumps,
little tops. All you have to do is just put
'em on just like so. Now the only thing that we're
worried about at this point is a nice top edge up here. We could care less
what's happening in here. Doesn't make any difference
to us at this point. Now then, once again,
take a two-inch brush, grab this, and pull it. Because the liquid white's on
the canvas, you can move this color. It's wet, and it'll slip and
slide. There we go, grab it and pull. Maybe we'll just let this
blend right on out to nothing, just sort of float away out
here. Just like so. Now then, just by using brush
strokes, if you wanna make a little
mountain that's far away, just by using the little
brush strokes here, you can make the indication
of highlights and shadows, all kinds of little things. I hope you can see those. If you can't, when you're
painting, I guarantee, you'll understand what I'm
saying there because they'll show up,
it'll look like all kinds of beautiful little things that are
just happening out there
automatically, and you don't have to work at
all. And this is a lazy man's way of
painting. Shoot, I'll tell you what,
let's take some white, little bit of phthalo blue, a little of that mountain color
just to gray it down some. There, maybe in our world, way
back in the distance there, there lives a little foothill. Now push, see, hit it and
give it a little push. Make it slide a little, that
loads paint right out at the end of the
bristles. Let's go ahead up here. Okay, now we have a little
foothill, maybe it lives, yep, you're right, you're
right, there it is. Little foothill lives
right out there, see? We'll just let it disappear into
nothing. Very soft, quiet, gentle little thing. It lives down here at the
base of this big mountain, and he just watches
everything that goes on. There we are. Okay, now then, while we
have that color on the brush, maybe we wanna make the
indication of a little reflection down
here. To do that, just pull straight
down with a little bit of the
color, but straight down, that's important. And gently across. Now that'll give us an
indication
of a little reflection. Other thing we can do, lift
upward, very short little strokes. That'll make it look
like little distant trees that live way back there, far,
far away. Very subdued, though. All right, now one thing
that gives a painting a lot of depth and distance is different planes or layers in
it. So let's make several
different layers in here. We'll just use that old
mountain color here. I think that was just black,
a little prussian blue, little van dyke brown, alizarin crimson, and
to that, I'm gonna add the least little touch of sap
green. Not much, just a little. Once again, tap the brush just
to load it. Now then. Let's begin putting in all
different layers or planes. Maybe there's one that lives
right here, and it comes right down like
that. Let your imagination go and
decide where you want all these
little things to live. There, okay, now then, each
time you put one of these little peninsulas out here
though, we need a reflection under it,
it's very important. Pull straight down, go gently
across. And then you can make a decision where the next one lives. Maybe the next one is right
here. Now see, you may, it's
almost a natural tendency to want to put all of these in
and then put the reflections, but when you pull these
down, it would destroy the top of that one. Hope all that makes sense,
so do 'em one at a time. Don't be in too big a hurry. Speed will come
automatically with practice. There. Right now, we're just trying
to learn the basic technique. Maybe, shoot, maybe there's
another one right here. I don't know. Just let it go, that's the
beauty of this, you really don't have to set and plan
every little detail out. Have a general idea in your
mind of where you wanna go with this painting and
what you want it to look like. So basically, all you
have to do is figure out the time of year and the time of
day. And other than that, you're
free. You can do anything here that
you want. Let's take a little cad
yellow, be right back, grab a little of the sap green. We'll just use a fan brush
today, doesn't matter. Little touch of yellow ochre. There, maybe a little
more of the green here. There, that's a beautiful green. But by mixing color on
the fan brush like this, you have a multitude of color
happening in the bristles. Look at all the different
values and colors. My gosh, you'd work forever to
do that if you were trying to mix each
one of those separate colors. This way, it happens
automatically. Then we can go back up in here and we can just begin
pushing in some highlights. We need that dark underneath,
though, so this nice green color will
show. There. You know what? Let me grab another fan brush. I see something here I'd like to
do. Let's take another fan brush. We'll go right into some black, brown, same old colors again. Crimson, sap green. Little bit of the prussian blue. Very dark color. In my mind, see how you
can change your mind? I see little trees, maybe
there's little evergreens that live way back here. Just take the top corner
of this fan brush, and we'll put in the
indication of little trees that are far away, we don't
want too much detail there. If you put too much detail
in trees this far away, you'll lose that illusion of
distance. So just a little, there. There we go, let 'em
just come right on down and disappear into nothing. There we are. Now then. Back to our fan brush. And we can put in all those
beautiful little green areas. There we are, isn't that
fantastic? Now work in layers, though,
watch here, watch here. See, here comes another one out
here on this little peninsula that
sticks out into the water. That easy. That easy, and you can just put
layer after layer after layer. Now then, let's take a little
touch of the liquid white. A little liquid white. I'll put the least little
touch of the bright red into the color. Pull it out as flat as you can
get it, and then cut across like that,
okay? Now then, let's go up here. And let's just cut in a little
water line. Now even though this
water line is dropping down, down, down, you
want to keep these lines basically straight,
otherwise it'll look like, it'll look like the water's
gonna run right out of your painting
and get your floor all wet. So you can go anywhere
you wanna go with these, but try to keep 'em as
straight as possible. There. And maybe here and
there, maybe you want to put the indication of a
little ripple here and there. Those too need to be as
straight as possible. Try to keep those straight. Tell you what, let's get crazy. We'll go right back to the
old fan brush that I had that had the black and the
prussian blue and the brown and green,
crimson. Load a lot of color into the
bristles. And maybe in our world there
lives... Maybe there's a nice evergreen
tree that lives right here, just
touch. Give yourself sort of
a little center line. Now we're gonna use just
the corner of the brush, just the corner. See there, and these
little evergreens live right here in these fan brushes. All you have to do is sorta
scare 'em out. And as you work down the tree, add more and more pressure. We're still using the corner of
the brush, but we're just pushing harder
and harder. And automatically your tree
will get larger and larger as it works downward, and
normally, trees look better if that's the
case. There we go, now then, you know
me, I think everybody should have a
friend. So let's go right here and
give this little tree a friend. Same thing, see just use
a corner of the brush and work back and forth. Like so. There. And that easy, we got
a couple of beautiful little evergreen trees. Now then, we can take
the knife, take a little titanium white, little dark
sienna, mix it together. Pull it out very flat, and we
cut across. Once again, we get our
little roll of paint. Normally, normally, we
always load the knife with that little roll of
paint, so spend a little time practicing so you can do that
without even thinking about it. Okay, little bit right there. There we go, and that
just gives the indication of some little tree trunks on
our trees. We don't want 'em to be weak and
fall over and drop into the water. We'll take a little bit
of black, a little yellow, and make a very dark green. We'll put that on the fan brush. A lot of color, just load
both sides full of color. Let's go right up here. Now then, in my world,
maybe the light's coming from the right, so we
wanna put more emphasis on the right side of the
tree than we do on the left. There we go, and we'll put
some highlights on this tree. But evergreen trees are
normally quite dark, so don't let 'em get too bright
on you 'cause them rascals will. It get to be fun, and next thing
you know, you've covered up all your dark
areas. And you need that contrast
to make your tree beautiful, make it stand out. There, darker, darker, darker
down here toward the base 'cause trees are darker,
there's more shadows down here. All right, shoot, let's get
crazy, get the big brush. Let's go right into that dark
color. Same old thing, black, blue, van
dyke, a little crimson, a little sap
green. We'll use the old two-inch
brush. Pull it in one direction here,
load a lot of color into it. There we go, let's go right up
here. Now then, let's just put
something right here, watch
here. Let's just begin, and you have
to make some decisions here. Where do you want all these
little bushes and stuff to live? Here they are, wherever you want
'em, that's exactly where they oughta
be. And we'll just let 'em
sort of fade out down here. But that easy, that easy. When you use this big
old brush, you can cover a lot of space quickly. There, and this is a two-inch
brush. There, okay, and all we're
doing, once again, is just
laying in some dark color so when we apply our
highlights or our light colors, that they'll stand out and show. It's really the only
reason we put this in here. Now then, another thing you can
do, you can take just a clean
knife and sneak up in here and just scrape in all kinds of
little sticks and twig areas. Now when this is done, it'll
look like you spent days and days with your little
one-haired brush just going in here and drawing
all these. We're gonna cover up a lot of
'em, but some of 'em will show,
and people will think you worked for long periods of
time to create all these little
things. And that's our secret,
shh, don't tell nobody. Okay, so I say most of
those will disappear, but some of 'em will still
be there, and they'll create some very nice effects. I'm gonna dip the one-inch brush into a little bit of the liquid
white. I do that only to thin the
paint, one of our golden rules, a thin paint will stick to a
thick paint. Let me get a little black on
there, I'll make a nice green. Black and yellow make a
beautiful green. Pull this brush in one
direction, one direction. See there, now that loads a lot
of paint. Now look right there,
see, when it starts making those little things, Steve,
my son who teaches this, he tells his students when
little bushes start appearing right here in this pile
of paint when you pull it, then the brush is loaded
correctly. And that's an excellent
way of checking it. But you can see how it
begins appearing right there. When your brush begins doing
that. Then let's go up here. Then make some big decisions in
here. Maybe there's a happy bush
that lives right here. Touch, give a gentle push. You don't have to push hard. If you have a thinner paint
than what's on the canvas and you've loaded a lot of
color into the bristles, see there, and make one
little bush at a time. I know sometimes it gets feeling
good and you want to make a bunch at
once. Try to make only one bush at a
time. Think about 'em as individuals,
give 'em names if necessary. And that's what makes 'em stand
out. Do the bush that in your mind
is the farthest away first, and then work forward,
always working forward, and that way there'll be depth
and distance in your work. Little more color, and I'm
going through the indian yellow, the yellow ochre, cad yellow. Here and there, least little
touch of the bright red. Not much, it's very strong, very
strong. It'll take over your whole
world in a heartbeat. But it does make some
nice little color changes here and there. There. Okay, maybe another
little bush right there. I tell you what, tell you what. This looks just like a
natural place to have a little path, so let's
take some, we'll take some van dyke brown, a little dark
sienna. Pull it out very flat,
once again, we cut off our little roll of paint. Now then, where does our path
go? Maybe it goes right up in here. And all we're doing, once again, is putting some dark color on
so our light color will show. This is just our
undercolor, our base color. And in just a few minutes, we'll
come back and we'll highlight that. We'll just sort let that
just sorta dribble out here to nothing, just sorta
let it go, we don't know. Like that. Now then, we can take some
with, a little dark sienna, maybe the least little touch
of bright red in it, not much. Pull it out flat, don't
over mix your color. Get our little roll of paint. Now barely, barely grazing the
canvas, just let the knife just
barely, barely caress it. Just so it hits the high
points, and it'll make it look like all those little bumps
and rocks and beautiful little things
happening automatically. Automatically, there we go. Now then, we can come back
with our one-inch brush, and we'll just pop in a
little bush here and there. Bring it all together. Can add a little paint
thinner to your brush sometime to thin the paint. And let's go right over here. See, we'll have a little
bush that lives right here and hangs over the path, that
way we don't have to decide where it
goes. We just know it goes somewhere
back into the background. We don't know. Don't care at this point. See, just sorta let that go. Now then, tell you what I wanna
do. I wanna take the little piece
of contact paper I have off and let's see what we have here. We'll just grab that, pull it
off, zoop, and there it goes. Now then, see, we need to
get rid of these edges. So all we'll do is take a
little of the dark color, tap a little of that in so
it just sorta flows with it. Just let it flow right on out
like that. But I wanna keep this
contoured roundish idea going here, sorta makes it
look a little bit better. Put some dark in, then we can
come back and put all kinds of just little
bushes and things in here. See, use the side of
the brush, push upward. But work in layers,
always working in layers. Think about individuals. There. Okay, now let's go back
to our fan brush that has the white on it for the clouds, and let's go up in here,
I'm gonna find a clean two-inch brush, I wanna
blend this blue here. See this little line
here, I wanna kill that, so we'll just blend that out and just sorta let it go
backwards here. Now. That's all you have to
do, just blend it back. And we'll take our cloud and
allow it to come right down there. There it goes, and just let
it blend right on back, see? It's right on into nothing, we
don't know where it goes, we don't care. And this one. Okay, then a nice clean
brush, give it a little blend. Like so. Lift it, fluff it, and that
brings that whole top section together. I tell you what, think this
old painting is about done. Let's take a little of the
bright red on the liner brush, a
little paint thinner, and we'll sign this one right
about here. I hope you've enjoyed
this, it'll certainly give you a lot of practice. It's a beautiful little painting
to do if it's your first project. Think you'll enjoy it. And from all of us here, happy
painting and God bless, my friend. (light music)
