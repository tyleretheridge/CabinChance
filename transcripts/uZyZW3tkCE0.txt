okay welcome back I'm glad you could join me today today I'm standing here with some of my little friends that I'm going to show you here this is for little Robins and they're just they're just little babies only a few days old where they oh look at that they are hungry too course little Robins are always hungry and they live with me and they're just cute little devils hey I got one here that he's gonna he's not going to yell okay I just thought I'd share those way today these are just little babies they're probably all maybe a week old now and we'll raise those and turn them loose here in just a few months I tell you what let's do let's have run all the colors across the screen but you need to paint along with me and while they're doing that I'll set these little rascals down here's my palette and we'll do a fantastic little painting together I've already covered the canvas with a nice thin even coat of the liquid white so it's all wet and slick and it's ready to go so let's just have some fun thought today maybe we just do a happy little winter scene such a super super day let's just do a painting that's got a lot of color in it it's bright and shiny make you feel good inside go start out with a least little touch of the Indian yellow it's a very transparent just tap a little bit into the bristles and we have to make a decision right off today you have to decide basically where your horizon line is going to be maybe our horizon would be right along in here somewhere about in that area so we just will just drop a little bit of yellow in there that easy okay now without washing the brush want to add a least little touch of the CAD yellow cadmium yellow will go right above this and it's an opaque color so it'll stand out very nicely here see if there's a difference once again without cleaning the brush a touch of the yellow ocher it's sort of a golden color and we let it right in here as I say I want a beautiful little winter scene that has some color in it sometime winter scenes can be so cold they're almost a body they're not fun to look at and then let's go let's go into a little touch of the bright red what the heck I think that would look good right up here we still haven't cleaned the brush so we just take the bright red and allow it to mix right in it that's a pretty sky already now we're just blending them together so you can't tell where one color stops and the next color starts just like so now we'll wash the brush and just sort of clean it off down here get rid of some of that color we'll wash our brush as always with odorless thinner shake it off cover two or three camera people who are in business we have the weirdest camera people in in the industry because they all have these funny colored freckles all over their face I'm gonna go right into a little touch of the phthalo blue and I'll reach right up here and get a little bit of a midnight black blue and black or black and blue whatever your preference and then we'll go right up to the top and let's just dance and a happy little sky here just making a little crisscross strokes like so and then they come right on down right on down to the red there and where these two come together it'll turn sort of a lavender color but it also this red acts as a barrier between the yellow and the blue so you don't end up with green there we are okay now that we'll wash the old brush again just get a good and clean shake it off give it a good whack and then we can just blend this guy together like so if you do this at home I'd recommend you get your brush beater rack because if you beat your brush against a solid object like I do here you go there you're going to redecorate your living room and your popularity's go and go down about ten points I mean just that quick now then let's take the knife let's go down here get a little touch of the yellows a little bit of the yellow ocher like so little the CAD yellow mix pull it out flat get a small roll of paint out here on the knife maybe down in here there's just indication of some little clouds that are floating in here all you have to do is just touch it'll take what it wants just touch it then with a nice dry two-inch brush very gently just blend these out if you really want to throw some light in there you can take a tiny bit of titanium white and put it here let it sort of blend upward it'll really make that sparkle it doesn't show much now but when we put different colors down in here at Sun we're going to jump out at you shoot I tell you what we got this old big brush go ahead let me show you let me show you let's have some fun we'll go right into that titanium white what the heck what the heck okay let's go here maybe up here in this sky lives up a beautiful cloud just up here floats around has fun just using the corner of the brush making little circular patterns just little tiny circles around and around we just let it go right over in here somewhere we don't care wherever you want it to live there yeah then let me grab a clean brush I have several of them going we just blend the base of this out like so we're carefully not touching the top yet see the top of these individual shapes we want to save and then we're going to fluff them just fluff them up there look at that and then very lightly just blend the entire sky dad easy okay maybe we will get crazy they shoot I'll just use a one-inch brush it doesn't matter let's take some dark Sienna a little that on there and a little bit of black with it dark sienna and black mostly dark Sienna though let's go right along in here and maybe there's some dark clouds same thing little circular patterns just think about basic cloud shapes don't just throw the symbol think about individual shapes are you doing it there we go maybe it comes right down in here wherever you want a little more color on the brush and andanddan right there and you can put clouds anywhere that you want them in your world anywhere painting is very individual anything that makes you happy then it's right then it's right there we go now once again with a large brush I'm just going to sort of mix this up the biggest thing this does is removes the excess paint and it will come back and we'll highlight these little clouds make them really stand out this just takes off the excess paint so you don't become a bud mixer and then you'd be then you'd be mad at me alright let's grab an old fan brush I'm going to go into the titanium white titanium white I'll be right back right back on get a little touch of alizarin crimson just mix them on the brush shoot that's fine nice pinkish color now that lets go right in here and just highlight just some of these clouds here and there just where you think light would strike there just make all kinds of beautiful little things that easy that easy just using the corner of the brush though that's all we're using and just once again those tight little circles and you make the most beautiful fluffy little clouds you've ever seen there maybe there he is there he is I knew he was there so did you we just had to find him pull him out there little up here and wherever you want them throw with too much color if you put too much and it's too bright then you'll lose that beautiful darkness that you've worked so hard to get in these underneath clouds now the large brush will just blend this again all we're doing is softening the bottom part that we want to save those nice top edges just soften the bottom so it blends together I beat the brush only to remove the excess paint off of it it's easier than going through the whole cleaning procedure then we can fluff this up pull it shape it tease it there we go very lightly just blend it all together I won't take my large brush and add a little more of a pinkish color right in now a little bit pink right in there whew that's pretty and if you'll experiment with these guys it's unbelievable what you can make and of course none of us are interested in that happy buck but if you should be how selling your paintings these kind of paintings sell like hotcakes because of all these beautiful colors of hair you'll find if you're selling paintings that people buy paintings as much for color as for content a lot of time people are are looking for for painting to match your room or to create a mood I'm using just darks and a little bit of black here be right back put a little white into it there we go just a nice dark brown color tap a little into the bristles and we have to make another big decision may be back here lives a little Foothill and all we're doing is just tapping just sort of decide where he lives and just tap like so see how easy that is pipe it comes on back up in here they're just a beautiful little Foothill back in there now we can grab that and very gently short tiny little strokes lift upward and it'll look like little trees that live far far away far away now tell you what let's create some mist at the base of this I take clean two inch brush and tap firmly you can probably hear how loud that is we're really tapping but just the base see they're just the base of it and that will create that illusion of mist maybe back in here we want a little snow we're going to have a winter scene we need some snow it's hard to have a winter scene without some snow unless you live in Florida okay decide where your snow is gonna live we take the large brush and just pull and it doesn't show up too much yet against that white canvas but it will as we work on down here see sometimes you can get a little crazy let's play a little game here take that same color maybe maybe there's another little layer of trees that are far off right in there see there give it a little upward lift shoot that easy we got another layer of trees grab the bottom of it and pull it allow some of that color mix right in the white it helps create that illusion mist okay in here these are just some of the colors that were in the sky I'm going to add right in here just wipe them on any away some of them will show through and it looked like it looked like reflections coming from this beautiful sky on the hair and it just happens you don't have to worry about it it'll be there for you alright tell you what let's have some fun we just keep using this old - integration you can do this with a round brush you'd work just as well I got this one dirty so we'll just use it take just the corner maybe back in here lift some beautiful little tree shapes all we're looking for is just basic shapes these are just little trees that are far away back here just tap them in see how easy that is okay let's put let's put a few little few little trunks and limbs and stuff in there I'm using just Van Dyck Brown liner brush a lot of paint thinner on it turn the brush this is thin like ink and maybe we can just see some three trunks here and there there they go just a little trunk we don't know how many trees are back here however many you want there see there and that easy you have indication of all kinds of little things happening just wherever now sometimes it's fun let me show you something I'll show you something we'll take some liquid white put it out on the pallet maybe we can come right down here then I'm going to mix some yellow ochre with it so you have a very thin paint now very very thin can we clean my knife up now we'll take the liner brush dip it into paint thinner I will go into the Van Dyck Brown load a lot of color but it's very thin okay now then come back direct down here now with a liner brush full see if we can get a close-up right here I show you the liner brush is full of brown now you go right through this very thin color now see it's got white on one side and brown on the other now then let's go up here maybe up in here there's some big trees there right in here and you can do the highlight and the shadow and one stroke and sneaky huh okay reloaded and egg Brown and we'll go right through the liquid white with a yellow ocher in it and you can make some of the most beautiful tree trunks Brown and wherever you want them and as many as you want maybe there's some little things that there they are okay a little more of the paint thinner pull it right through put some happy little limbs on this tree that's sneaky event you can make both sides of the tree in a single stroke there we go did it make some beautiful trees and the stick in a twig and all those happy little things and sometimes it's nice to put just the indication here and there have a few things that are hanging on so I'll just take a little dark cni little yellow ocher I'm just going to tap the top corner of the brush into it very very little paint and here and they're just little indications that maybe there's something few little leaves still hanging on here not many just a few don't want to overdo it's very easy to overdo there okay now that shoot let's have some fun let's have some fun we'll take some black and some brown some phthalo blue mix them together might as well makes up a lot of paint here a lot of old paint okay tell you what let me wipe the knife off let's use a fan brush today let me kinda there's a good fan brush we go right into that dark color let's get a lot of paint on the brush a lot of paint now then have to make some big decision maybe in our world our lives a nice little evergreen right there right there to use just a corner of the brush work back and forth back and forth as you work down the tree apply more and more pressure so it gets wider thicker stronger toward the bottom there look at that look at that boy that really stands out against that light background over there maybe yeah right there we give him a little friend everybody needs a friend you know if painting has done nothing else it has brought me so many new friends it's unreal I've met literally thousands of fantastic people all because of painting there we are maybe over here let's have a big tree was a strong son of a gun he goes at piers is where that this is where the hawk sets the big eagle maybe depending on where we're at there or maybe the ally showed in the last program maybe that's where he lives there he sets up here and surveys the whole country site watches for a little mouse to go scampering across the snow and he comes down on wings that are soft as velvet you're never hearing and zip okay now then watch here let me take a little white on the large brush I want to create the illusion of another plane right here so take titanium white grab a touch of that blue just a touch and pull it just pull it and then begin blending it that's simply see there you can create a whole nother plane you got one separate for this tree grab it pull again you can create as many different areas as you want in your world that easy see these colors that we put on those nice pinks and oranges they're beginning to show through and they're beautiful there we huh said oh oh looks like deep dark background area now okay tell you what we'll just take the knife scrape right through here just make the indication of a little trunk all we're doing is scraping right through the paint I'll add a little bit of the canvas to show through you can paint a trunk in if you want to all I'm doing is just scraping it out alright grab another fan brush take a little the liquid white little titanium white little phthalo blue mix them together there beautiful blue that phthalo blue is so pretty a lot of paint on the brush now let's go right up in here let's just put some highlights on these trees mm-hm that is beautiful so beautiful way it stands out brings that tree alive makes it jump out at you and what makes us so attractive this is a cool color blue is a very cool color and it gives these home warm colors back here it's very nice to play cool against warm vice-versa there okay shoot I had a spot like yet and have to build me a little house out here I have to live right out here there's a lot of ways you can make a little house let's do a little little thing right here the easiest way is take your knife and scrape out a basic shape maybe we'll maybe we'll do a fancy little louver out here okay we can scrape this out without being committed maybe it comes out maybe goes on over here what the heck maybe that carpenter just got crazy and has a long roof over here there's a side here's the front or however maybe that's the front it's up to you now then take Van Dyck Brown a little dark sienna in it just mix them together pull the paint out very flat small roll of paint right out on the edge of the bleed okay now then let's go right in here hmm kind of make those little noises huh all we're doing here just blocking in color there we go just block it in Thanks and then let's take some Reds a little yellow ochre grab some white and we want this to really stay marbled get our little roll of paint okay now then let's just go right along here just barely touch just let it bounce across I'll make all kinds of beautiful little things happen here just all kinds of things right out here in this edge a little brighter there look at that hmm now on the other side on the other side this will be a little darker not as much lights can hit here but the same basic thing just let it tap want this to look old and there we go there we go maybe tell you what let's put some snow up here on the roof and we just gonna let this know bounce along like it's old snow up here so it's thick so thick I just gently pull right across that it'll look like you can look through it make some very nice effects very thick though sometimes we paint very thin other times very very thick maybe this old cabin yeah let's have a little shared right here what the heck little bit of brown Jim just like we did the other one some of our nice highlight colors tap those in darker over here okay little white up here just like so okay now we can come in here we just do our old cabin ectomy and this is where you get your perspective right bringing everything together get all that color off the canvas go into a big brush now then just come right up in here - yeah we can lay all kinds of happy little snow things in here just like a begin thinking about the lay of the land there where are you going - a little add a little a little blue to that there now maybe we want to change the angle watch here watch here maybe this comes down like that just by doing that we can change this angle yeah then take your fan brush we'll take a little dark seeing a little Van Dyck Brown mixed together and let's just pop in some little bushes and so little weeds right along in here like so push the brush upward so it bends maybe over in here there's a few in here wherever you want there we go and back to our fan brush it has white on it grab a little of that pull it then just blend it together just blend it together tell you what maybe in our cabin over here let's have a couple little windows - OOP OOP that easy we got a happy little window let's get crazy you know me I like your little big trees so let's take some of the Browns I spend Ike dark Sienna let's go right up here maybe their lives in our world a big old tree right about there and we give them a little friend take a little bit of light color go right down the side so one sides got some highlight grab it give it a little pull like so take our liner brush a little thin paint on it and we'll drop in some little sticks twigs little arms on this tree just like that all kinds of little things into that weave that haven't finished painting while I'm finishing this up I'd like to to wish you happy painting hope you've enjoyed this one it will certainly certainly help you if you paint us what you'll learn how to use the equipment to play with color to make your day better but a little stick in a twig here I think we'll call this painting finished so from all of us here happy painting and God bless you you
