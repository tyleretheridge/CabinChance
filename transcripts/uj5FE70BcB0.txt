welcome back I'm glad you could join me today you need to do a fantastic little painting with me got your palette all set up and you're ready to go good tell you what let's have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to do the painting that we're going to do today and they'll come across in exactly the same orders I have them on my palette starting with the white we coming all the way around and while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started I've already covered the canvas with a thin even coat of liquid white it's wet and slick and it's all ready to go so today let's just have some fun I'm gonna start out with a small amount of Indian yellow tiniest little bit just tap a little bit onto the brush let's go right up in here in the sky and just let a little tiny bit of that play around just here and there put that in first yes just little spots of it maybe a little down here I'm gonna have a little water in this painting so we'll put a little tiny bit right in there then without cleaning the brush I'm gonna go right into a small amount of alizarin crimson just tap the breast and leave that Indian yellow in the brush it makes a pretty color okay let's go back up here now then I'm just going to bounce a little bit of this crimson here and they're gonna sort of play it around let it have fun hair like nice warm little sky happy little sky over in here Oh kinds of pretty little colors that looks good enough feet they look like just a touch in the water since we know there's gonna be some water in here just like so okay now then without clean the brush again I'll go right into a little bit of the midnight black and a small amount a low blue blue and black just a small amount this black is so strong okay let's go back up here now that the sky that's remaining let's just sort of dance in a little bit of this blue-black color just let it bounce around and play just hair in there hey wherever you think it would be that's exactly where it should be okay use that same color blue and black and let's finish up our water area now water unless it's moving is always flat it's level so try to keep these strokes as straight as possible it'll make it will make your water look better now very quickly this blue and black mixture is so strong it lead up is a light area so try not to cover that up we'll save a little touch of that that'll be pretty when it's all day okay let me wash my old brush here and if you painted with me before you know this is the fun part shake it off and then that really is the fun fight get us go back up here be sure your brush is clean and dry and I'm gonna very gently using little crisscross patterns just blend all this together and when you're painting it at home you paint as soft as you want it the more you blend it the softer it will become it'll just absolutely all blend together there we go just let your imagination take you wherever you want to be you know one of the letters questions I get in letters all the time is where do we get all that ideas for the paintings that we do you know one of the best ways we have of coming up with ideas misra cards people send us we get cards from fantastic people all over the country and they tell us what they want to see a lot of them send home postcards or photographs and believe it or not that's where the majority of these paintings come from hmm okay and that quick we have a very colorful nice little sky this has some fun let's take the old round brush I want to go into a little bit of Van Dyck Brown a little bit of the sienna touches half green we just mix them together on the brush tap that brush please go right back up here well has some happy little bushes back here and I'm just barely tapping the canvas not tapping very hard and I want them to get lighter toward the top just make a decision what you think your bushes already look like and drop them in okay a little bit more paint this is dark sienna Van Dyke Brown a little bit of SAP green don't want too much green I want to stay sort of in the in the brownish tones apparently you can take a lizard crimson and SAP green and mix together make a beautiful brown color maybe there's little things that live right up in here just wherever you want and if you want to show some things that are far far away then just barely touch a canvas so there's just little tiny indications see and it looks like little distant distant things far far back in the distance barely barely touching the canvas three hairs into some air okay now then let's put a few little highlights on there we'll take the same old brush just leave it dirty use a little bit of the yellows little green just tap it see just tap right it into it okay now then just using the top corner of the brush begin laying in a few little basic shapes and sort of vary the colors between all the different yellows it's barely touching the canvas yellow curry Indian yellow CAD yellow all these colors if you have trouble making them stick at the least little touch of the liquid white or a little bit of thinner to your brush tiniest little bit tiny little bit just enough so it sticks there we go and leave these that are far far away with nothing on them because they're too far away to see any highlights on don't don't kill everything with highlights you'll ruin the illusion of distance in your painting okay now then maybe you want to create the idea of mist just floating around here watch right here just take the big brush and gently tap right on the base of it right on the bottom just tap now avoid taking the brush like this and hitting it it'll cut it off real straight and looks like somebody took a big knife and just cut off all the trees we want this lag to be very soft and airy do you don't want you don't want two distinct line across there and then you can very lightly very lightly just lift up it a little bit see and that easy you have the illusion mist is floating all around the bottom of that okay I'll use the same old dirty brush go right into the Browns this is the dark sienna and the Van Dyke let's go right back up here maybe there's a happy little Hill right here now we don't want to kill all that misty area that we put right in here at misty area is what separates what divides okay all we're doing now is putting down a base color so our next color will show up you need the dark in order for light to show you knew that all right well I have this color on my brush and we'll pull a tiny bit of it down this will create the illusion of a reflection straight down you sure it goes straight down just like it and then very lightly across and it gives you the indication water that easy now a same old brush hadn't cleaned it yet according right into some of the yellows and the green and just tap that brush see tap it I can't all right come on back up here let's come right in here and drop in some highlights right on top of that dark and just like before if you have problems making it stick add a little bit of the liquid white or a little bit thinner then paint will stick to a thick paint and the base colors that we use are very very firm and here and there you can even take a little bit of the red color mmm look at their pretty and just drop in a few little things like yeah I'm gonna put a tiniest amount of thinner on the brush see how much easier it sticks even though my yellows are a little bit thinner than the other colors sometimes and you have several layers you want it really thin so to stick right up here mm okay it gives us a nice little background to play with and if you wanted to you could even pull a tiny bit of that highlight color right down into the reflections like so I'll use it another brush this one's clean and pull it down this is a clean dry brush and go across see how it reflects all those colors right into the reflections all right no let's take the knife I know use a little bit of brown here go to the Van Dyck Brown pull that payout as flat as you can get it and then just cut across so you have a little roll of paint right out of the edge of the knife casco up here now that I'm just gonna put just by rubbing it back and forth put the indication a little bit of land back here need something for all these little grassy things to sit on don't fall off in the water to make a big splash there there we go you can take that same brown add a little titanium white to it and with that make a little touch of highlight color just like so okay I'm take a little bit liquid white pull it out very flat okay then cut across it can you see that see cut across that gives you a little tiny roll of paint red on the knife blade let's go up here now I go straight into the canvas and act like you're trying to saw a hole in it just really get tough with it and that cleans up the bottom of your land puts a little water line there and creats once again the illusion of distance in your pain keep these lines basically straight you don't want your water to to run out on your carpet all right now we can take a clean knife and just creep in to indication of a few little trunks and twigs and little things like that here in there no big deal wherever you want okay time to have some fun here let's go back to our round brush I'm gonna go right back into the Browns this is a dark sienna the Van Dyck Brown a little bit of the sap green we'll throw in there to really tap that brush firmly we're going to get it loaded up okay let's go up here now then maybe yep there is now and we're really really hitting the canvas quite hard you can probably see it bending and hitting it so hard they're really socket in there maybe there's a huge yeah let's have a big trees lives right here and he just hangs right out over like that look at that look at that baby right on up out here wherever you make a decision wherever you want your tree to live that's where he lives trees are one of my favorite things to picked I think it's so beautiful okay let's really get crazy today maybe yep maybe there's a happy Bush it lives right there and he's got a friend named Clyde that lives right there he make up little stories when you paint it it really helps you don't have to be crazy to do this but it's it does help there see when you put on your painter suit you can get away with anything because everybody thanks us painters you know her a little weird so we could we can do anything and in your painting you paint things that make you happy you create your own visions your own world a lot of a lot of the letters that I've received people one to know what did i do before I became a painter and I spent half my life in the military I worked I worked in the hospital military and I would come home from work and I would paint for over 20 years I would do that I'd come home and paint because on this canvas oh and this canvas I could have total freedom nobody told me what time to be at work in what can the world to make here I can make any kind of world that I wanted any kind of world let's put a big tree right here sometimes I talk too much when I should be painting there we go but being in the military for half my life allowed me to see parts of the world that I would have never seen all the way to South East Asia and back and introduced me to my favorite place in the world Alaska that's some of the most beautiful scenery mmm you ever get a chance to go there if you haven't been you really should take a trip you'll see where a lot of the scenery that I paint comes from you may be like me and won't leave I just bought a house and stayed there okay there we go all right said you're talking so much about covered up whole canvas so why don't we let's just go ahead and fill all this in sometimes I get carried away as I say when I'm talking don't go in the stop okay and this is still just a dark Sienna van Dyke Brown and a little tiny touch a SAP green not much green and we're using a brush this big it didn't take but a few minutes just to cover it all up but you can also begin laying in some basic shapes and some basic ideas you can see them all in here and at this point you're not committed because you could put this part on well in all honesty you put it on with a paint roller we might have a whole new way of painting if we did that okay now you can sort of look at the shape of some of these trees I'm gonna I think I'll make this one a little bigger shoes we've covered up most of the canvas already why not just keep going with it there we go all that beautiful background we work so hard and we just covered it up let's take an old fan brush and I won't go right in to the Van Dyck Brown loaded brush full of paint both sides okay now watch I'm gonna take one side and go through white si went through both sides with Van Dyck Brown in one side with white so I've got white on one side brown on the other there we go let's go up here now then let's take and right here touch and give it a little pull and by double loading the brush we have both sides of the tree trunk at one time sneaky huh look at that and then pretty and it's easy to do fun to do can't tell you what listen put a trunk right here in this whole tree we can have him without it nice strong trunk and when you're doing these trunks all trees don't become telephone poles so makes them up with little crooks and bins and it makes your painting more interesting see put little little little bins in it really really will brighten up your painting make it look more natural spend some time looking at trees you know out in the woods and I hunt with a camera why I just shoot them dead with a camera and then you save these photographs and you can take a tree out of one photographing and maybe put it with another photograph that has a beautiful sky you can combine these things okay I'll take a little bit of paint thinner go right into some bright red right on the liner brush just turn it can't go right back up here maybe on this tree I take a little bit of this red and just come right down the edge to that very gently just blend that out see then make a pretty little tree it's easy there we go right down the side of this one do they just blend it out and if you wanted to you could add a little bit over in here just just hearing there wherever you want wherever you want sometimes you can take just a little bit of the liquid white unless it's do a little different here you take a little liquid white and come right down the side and then blend it in so it's bright on that far edge and softer as it goes toward the center of the trunk and that gives you the indication of roundness in your tree trunk you just blend it to whatever degree of softness that you want that easy or you can just take plain liquid white and here and there put an old white trunk you know this those trees that have white bark on and they're pretty everything is pretty happy little trees there we go now then a little bit of the liquid black on the liner brush and let's make the indication of a little branch here and there she just here and there this is just straight liquid black there all kinds little things okay that gives you an idea how to do that now I'll get to a round brush I'm going to add a little bit of the liquid white to it this is the same old dirty brush because I want the colors to be soft and muted so that I've left all the Browns on there I'm going right into the yellows now and I added a small amount of the liquid white just to thin the paint okay let's go back up here now then let's make some decisions using just the top of the brush just the top and just touch try not to hit the same area over and over or pretty soon you'll become a mud mixer and if you've painted before we've all experienced a little bit of mud mixing try to avoid that and here just worry about some basic shapes and just barely tapping barely touching don't have to hit hard don't have to hit it hard just enough to get the paint to come off the brush you've got a super nice easy way to put all those little leaves and stuff on the tree all right okay and little bit a bright red to that might as I'll get crazy I'm still just tapping okay let's go ahead up here baby these over here may be old Jack Frost is touch them a little bit you began and to see a little color and this is your creation so whatever color you want them to be once again remember your little patterns in here don't just I'll just throw this on at random thank like a tree thank like a tree okay just work on these little patterns create all kinds of happy little little things in here and don't kill all the darks you need those darks okay let's go to this other tree it's one on the far right don't want him to feel left out we'll give him a few happy little leaves up here mmm that's a nice one anyone really really worked nice when you paint sometimes a brush just hits right in things all they sparkle this Park oh that's one of our happy accidents we like those look at that I used to spend weeks with the one here brush trying to do all this now I'm lazy okay okay let's take oh I see another bush right here now you can begin just picking out little individuals just pick them out I don't go wherever wherever you want there's one sketch looks like little flowers all right I tell you right yeah let's take the fan brush and it has brown on it still I want a happy little path goes right back in here you'd have to have a way of getting back in here and catching a big trout that lives right over in there so it just put some brown on first then I just use the same old dirty brush I'll take some dark CNN some white just mix it loosely on the brush now just barely touching the canvas just let it sort of graze across there wiggly make it look like little stones I said this isn't a big paid tire here this has got little stones and rocks and so it's not real even just let it disappear right on it girl like so okay let's have some fun and we'll take the two inch brush and go right into the same colors that have been using the yellows so all the yellows all the Reds just bring them together now then let's begin making the indication of little grassy things that are growing right up to the paths here working layers do the area this is a father's two way first and work forward always working forward forward forward and make little individual things just don't just don't throw them in there at random see you could even make your bush right here it's like so don't paint all of them leave some of them dark just gonna add a little more green to that this whole big brush you can just tap in all kinds of beautiful beautiful little highlights like so work in layers I can't say that enough can't say that enough Oh cancel it alleles hmm and that's super think we're light with strike seeing the lights coming through there and just zing in here in there and if you think lights really gonna strike here you can add a little white and really make it look like lights just coming right through there okay let's go over here in this other side and put in some happy little things right there like that I always pay attention to the lay of the land there we go nice bright one right there it stands out makes it look like a little rounded area that helps push it path all the way back up in there okay I'm going back to moe fan brush it has the brown on I tell you what let's get brave right here right here zoom there's a big old tree and he's got a friend right there don't even get lonely we'll give him a friend seen that that helps push the whole path area back further into the painting to take a little bright red a little white and brown mix it together here and let's just put the indication of some highlight right here make his tree stand out we want him to really shine in the sunlight there just put a little highlight on him I don't have where ever you wanted we use a little bit of the brown on the other side just to make it dark dark dark over here and so it makes that tree look around okay our liner brush with some of the liquid black and that click that quick gives us some happy little tree limbs see and as many as you want this is your tree so you just put them where you want them and however many you want there we go and we have an indication of a few branches there let's take the old big brush we'll go right into some SAP green and some of the yellows and let's go right up here and then you can put the indication of some nice little nice little leaves that live right out here just like so look at there and that's all there is to it just drop them in and the old clock on the wall tells me it's it's time to sneak out of here for this week so with that I think we'll call this painting finished I look forward to seeing your gift happy painting god bless you
