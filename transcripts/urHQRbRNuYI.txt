- Hi, welcome back. Certainly glad you could join us today. You know, I'm so crazy
about this colored gesso, and the black and white and gray gesso that we've been using. I thought today we'd do
another little painting using some of that. But, let's start out
first of all and have run all the colors across
the screen that you need to paint along with us,
and they'll come out right about there. Okay, while they're doin'
that, let me show you what I've got today. Today, I've taken an
oval canvas, now this is, I hope you can see it
against the black background. But, this is just a canvas
that's made in the shape of an oval, a lot of
times we use contact paper and make ovals on rectangular canvases, but today, I'm using an oval canvas. You can pick it up in any
art store around the country. And, I've taken a little of the
black, white, and gray gesso and a liner brush, and probably
an old liner brush is better to use, and I've just painted
in some little tree trunk shapes, very quick. And then, some limbs, and
then took a paper towel and just daubed in a little
bit of, little gobs of gesso to make it look like little
leaf areas, and allowed that to dry completely. Now, let's go right down
here, down at the bottom I've taken the Filbert brush
and I've used black gesso and gray gesso and I've just
made some little stones, the same way as we make stones normally. In fact, before it's over
with, I'll show you how to make some above the water. I'm gonna have water in this and I want to have stones underneath. I allowed the gesso to
dry completely, gesso is an acrylic base and it
needs to dry completely. After it was dry, then I've covered the entire little oval
canvas with a very thin coat of liquid clear. And, the clear is on there
just to make it wet and slick, and it allows us to actually
blend color right up here. Whew, what a long explanation! But, it's really very simple
and if you've never painted this is one you can do. Let's start out today with
a, we'll use a two inch brush and a small amount of Phthalo
blue, I like Phthalo blue because it's a very bright
blue, it's a happy blue. There we go, and it's very transparent. But, just load a little
onto the two inch brush. Okay, let's go up in here now. Now, all you have to do
when you have this gessoed background, is really just apply color. And, it's mixing with the
liquid clear that's on there and what it is in reality is a glaze. It's just a glaze, it goes
right over the top of that. And that easy, you can just turn this into a gorgeous blue background. Now, you can do this with
any transparent color, I just picked blue
today, but you can do it with any color, it doesn't matter, any transparent color. Sap green in this particular
painting would be gorgeous. While I've got that blue on
there, I'm gonna just add a little more on my brush. Let's just cover up
the rest of the canvas. Now already, just painting over these, I hope you can see 'em. These little rock indications,
already, it looks like there's water on top of 'em. I'm just gonna go ahead
and cover all of this with Phthalo blue while
I have it on the brush, somethin' about like that. Now, when you're doin' this
with these colored gessos it's unbelievable some of
the effects you can make. And, all the different transparent colors. If you wanted this to be
greenish, you could take like Indian yellow and
mix in here, it'd make a green background. It'd be wonderful. Or once again, you could
just use Sap green. Let your imagination go, experiment. And, you know, the very,
the very worst thing, the very worst thing
that can happen to this is that you take a paint
thinner on the paper towel and you wipe it off, it
doesn't hurt the gesso at all and you do it again. A wonderful way to
practice, because you can't make a mistake here. Let's wash the brush. It's the most fun part, anyway. It's the most fun part. Shake off the excess, (laughter) and just beat the devil out of it. That really is the fun part. Okay, I think maybe today, we need a way for the
water to get down here. I'm gonna have a little waterfall. I'll show ya how easy it is
to make a little waterfall. I'm gonna dip my brush into a little bit of liquid clear, and then we'll go through the Titanium white. I'll be right back, I'm
gonna reach up here, and just get a little bit of Phthalo blue. I put the liquid clear
here just to thin it a little bit, that's all, just to thin it. I tell you what let's do,
let's make a waterfall today, that maybe there's a big rock behind it. So, if there is, we just grab a little bit of this Van Dyke brown, real quick and a little Dark sienna mixed together. I'll show you how easy it is to make a, maybe like a little rock
that lives right here. Just take the knife and
sort of pull in a little bit of brown, do the thing
that's farthest away first. I decided that it would be
neat to have a rock back here, so we'll put it in first. Take a little white, we'll
take a little Midnight black and put with it, a
little more, I wanna make a gray color, and a little
touch of Prussian blue. So, it makes sort of a bluish gray color, maybe even a little Dark sienna. But notice, we're leaving it marbled, we're not over mixing it. When we cut off with
the knife and pick it up those same streaks or striations in there, will be right in there. And, when you touch, very
gently, just barely touch, all those little things'll
happen, it'll drive people crazy tryin' to figure out how
in the world you got all that detail in there. And, you didn't hardly do a thing. That's all there is to it. Make it look like a little rock. Now we go back to our fan brush. Think about a waterfall,
water's just coming along here, having a good
time, and falls over. See, that's all there is to it, just let it drop. Try to do it in one stroke. We'll add a little more clear. There, see? Straight, and then down. All right, I'll just keep doin' that and we'll end up here
with Niagara Falls, there. All right, that's basically all we want. When the water gets down toward the base, I'm gonna use the little blender brush. Tap a very small amount
of that color on there. I wanna create splashin' and mist. I'll just use the little
blender, 'cause it's so soft you can paint right over the top of that. We'll put a little, a
little mist right in there. I'm gonna use the other
corner, which is clean, I just turned it over, now then, just to diffuse it a little bit. A little hair fell out,
and we just pick it off. No big deal. There, these are natural bristle brushes, which means it's real hair. And sometimes, hair gets a little crazy, you know, look at mine. And, you'd lose a hair or two, don't worry about it, just take the corner of the brush like so, and lift it off. That's all there is to it. But look what gorgeous little misty area that made, and it's so easy. Van Dyke brown and Dark sienna, I want a good, strong dark brown here. A little roll of paint, once again. Now maybe, let's put a nice rock over here on this side. Somethin' to contain that waterfall. You just let it go
wherever you want it to go, right down to the mist, and sorta drag it so it just disappears into the mist. We can come back and
add a little more mist on this side too, just
to give the indication that the mist is floating around there. And back to our same
little colors that we used on the other side, and let's put a top up here on this. Make it look sort of flat, maybe a little fox comes right up here and looks over the edge and sees what's happenin', or whatever little creature you want. There we go. Little baby foxes are
one of the cutest things in nature. There. One of the animal rehab
people that I've worked with in Florida, Carmen Shaw,
she told me if you look in the dictionary under cute,
it'll say, see baby fox. I think that's true. All right, now that gives
us a nice little area and as I say, if you
wanted to bring this mist out a little more, you can bring it on this side of the rock, that easy. Now, it just sorta floats on both sides. This very soft brush works great for this. You can intermingle these colors without 'em blending. But, you need a very, very soft brush to do that. Now then, time to have some fun. We'll take the old, big brush. I'm gonna take some Midnight black, Prussian blue, I wanna
put some Alizerin Crimson in it, and some Sap green. Just all those dark
colors, it doesn't matter. Okay, let me clean off the knife. And let's take a little of that color right on the old two inch brush, and I'm tapping the bristles. Load it by pulling it through, load both sides full of paint, and then sort of tap it. That makes a nice chiseled edge that we can work with. And, let's go up in here. Let's have some big green bushes and trees that live up in here. And, maybe they start way up in here. I'm gonna put some dark on, just so we have an area for our highlights to show. You need dark in order to see light. So, just begin thinking
about basic shape, here. Just basic shapes, that's
all we're looking for. Ooh, it covered up all my
little trees back there, but we know they're there. Maybe there's a happy little
bush, lives right here. I'm using basically just
the corner of the brush. You could do this with a two inch brush, with a one inch brush, a round brush, it doesn't matter. Maybe we'll use a one inch brush, just to show you how it works, too. I usually prefer to use the big brush. Down here it doesn't take a whole lot 'cause the black gesso is gonna create that illusion for us. On the other side, you know me, let's have another big
bush that lives right here. It comes right up over the top. There, maybe it hangs out right here. Wouldn't this be a wonderful
place for a bush to live? It has all the water it wants and what a fantastic view. And, with this much
water churning, it'd be, the humidity would be very high here. It'd be wonderful for bushes and trees. There. Bring it down, right about like that. Shoot, we're about in business. Okay, let me find the
one inch brush, today. We'll use it to make
all these little things. I'll just go through. Let's go through the color
we put the background in with, take that through the yellows. And once in a while, we'll
touch a little bright red just to dull it. But, tap the same way. See that little ridge
of paint right there. That's a fantastic closeup right there, but look at that, there's one just like it right on here on the end of the brush, and that's what we're gonna paint with. So, pull it to load it, then tap. That's all there is to it. Now, let's go up here and use it. Take this little one inch brush use just the corner, and begin picking out little, individual highlights. Little things that you see, up in there. Wherever you want 'em. But, do one little thing at a time. Don't get greedy. It gets working good, and it feels good, and off you go, next thing you know, you've covered up all your dark and have nothing left. If you have trouble making it stick, add the least little touch of paint thinner to your brush. Thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Thin to thick. There. And, reload frequently. When it stops coming off the brush easy, just reload it. There, once again, think
about shape and form and all the little things
that live in there. Darker, darker, darker, down here toward the base. There's gotta be a quiet place in there for the little bunny rabbit to live. There. Maybe there's a happy little bush, lives right here. Once again, you can do
this with a two inch brush, the one inch brush like I'm using here, the half-round brush,
or the full-size round, any one of 'em would work just as well. Today, I just thought I would
show ya this little brush. But, it's up to you. Up to you. Maybe, there's a little
thing that hangs right over the side there,
a big old bushy thing, Just sort of hangs over. I'm gonna add a little paint thinner to my brush. A little more Sap green, a little more of the yellow. Come right down here, maybe there's a huge, big, old bush that lives, or tree that lives here. Yeah, see. But, just think about individuals. This is not difficult at all to do. Probably once again, the biggest mistake made is it begins working, and you cover up all the dark. And then, you lose the definition between each little clump. There's probably a better word than clump, but I don't know what it is. Little, individual highlights. Spend some time studying trees and bushes. Go out in your yard and
make friends with a tree. People, (laughing) they'll
look at you like you're a little weird, but just
tell 'em you're an artist. They'll understand. Because, as artists, we're
allowed to be a little different. We see things differently. We appreciate nature
more than most people do. Enjoy that. There we go. Somethin' like so. A little devil lives right there. There. Wherever you want 'em. You make the decision. A little Indian yellow now and then. A little touch of the bright red, too. There, ooh, it's a nice little color. A shiny little color. Okay, the other side. Other side, we don't want him left out. Here's a happy little bush. I'm gonna change the color right there. Yeah, that's better, a
little more Yellow Ochre in that bush. He lives up here and he
watches the waterfall as it goes by. He's got the best view in town. There. Okay. But, once again. Don't get greedy with this. Just take your time. Do one little rascal at a time. Think about that big arm that hangs over here. Maybe this one comes right out in front of the waterfall. Allow some of 'em to come in front of the waterfall. It will push the waterfall back and make it look farther away. It'll make your painting look deeper, much deeper. There, somethin' about like that. You gotta hang on to these old trees and save 'em. Not only are they beautiful,
but they're beneficial. Shoot, they make oxygen, I like that. (laughter) There. It's like I get a lot
of, I get a lot of mail, even, I think, even the utility company sends all these
advertisements in the mail. Had to cut down a tree to make, so my big thing is now, I put 'em back in the envelope and send 'em back to 'em with a check. Let them dispose of 'em. If they get enough of 'em back, they'll quit sendin' 'em. There. I do that to everybody that sends me all kinds of junk mail. There we go. Now, let's put some land down here. We'll take a little bit
of that Van Dyke brown and Dark sienna mixed together. A little roll of paint, right
on the edge of the knife. Don't need a lot. Maybe, maybe in our world,
there's just a little peninsula, that comes out here. A little bit of land lives out here. We don't know, wherever you want it. Dark Sienna, Van Dyke brown. Maybe over on this side
there's even a little, not a lot. Now, go back to my little one inch brush, I'm gonna add some more Sap green, make it a little darker. Ooh, nice dark green color. Once again, tap. Get our little ridge of paint in there, about like that. Adjust the flavor, till
it's the way you want it. Now, right up in here, there lives a little bush, right there. Little grassy areas,
see how I'm using this to make you little grassy areas. Just sort of tap, tap, tap. There. It's much faster to do
with a two inch brush. But, this is, I just wanted to show you it'll work with either brush. So, on the other side over here, there's some little grassy areas. And, some people will find that they like the little brush better. It might give you a little more control. There we are. Now, I think the big
brush has more bristles, that you're using, and maybe that's why I prefer it. But, it's a very individual thing. I wanna show you as many different ways of doing things as possible. And then, what you do is up to you, totally and completely. I'm gonna take a little, a little bit of brown,
a little bit of white, a little paint thinner, on the old liner brush. And maybe here and there and there and here, we can make out the indication of a few tree trunks that live in there. Just some stems. We don't know what they are. I don't even know what's hook to 'em, if anything. Maybe this tree died, years ago. And, just sort of left
his skeleton out here. I like old trees. There. Wherever you think they should live, that's exactly where they should be. But see, those give different dimensions and planes in your painting. Creates the illusion of a little depth and distance. You can have a few over here, too. It doesn't matter. Just, wherever. Okay, time to have some fun here. Let's take. Let me clean off a spot to work. Got the biggest palette in town and I still use it all up. I think I'm just a messy painter. Let's take some black and some Van Dyke brown mixed together. We'll just mix it up. Now, I'm gonna add some paint thinner. I wanna thin this down very thin. So, I'm just adding paint thinner to it, that's all, no big deal. Because, remember our golden rule? Thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So, we thin this down, then I'm gonna make one more color and thin it down. Then, we'll paint some
little rocks in our water. There, just wipe the knife. We'll take, oh, there's
some nice gray color we used earlier. Might as well put it in there. Some white, then we'll
put a little black with it to make a gray. Maybe even, a little touch
of brown in that, too. Somethin' like that. You decide. That's too bright. We'll add a little more black to it. There, it's gettin' better now. Okay now, I wanna add paint thinner to that. Once again, same thing. All I'm doing is just thinning the paint, that's all. Just thinning the paint, because our paint is very dry, very firm. It's much thicker than
traditional oil paints. There, now we have two
piles of thin paint. One very dark, one light. Let's find a little filbert. There, let's take the filbert and we go through the dark first, both sides, load both sides. Now, I'll bring the light up here and pull just one side through the light. So, I have light on one side, dark on the other. Light, dark. There, you might be
able to see that better. Light, dark. Okay now then, be sure the light side is to the top. You can go up in here,
and just begin to decide where little rocks and stones live. Let's see, I'll turn this
way and you can see it. Touch, and just make a little just a little stone. Just like that. There we go. And, you decide how
many live in your world. Okay, let's put a few
on the other side, too. Maybe there's one, right
out on the end, here. And, you can make them big,
little, it doesn't matter. Some of 'em live up in here. Did you ever think you could paint so many little rocks, so easy? You can. This makes it very simple. Shoot, maybe there's a big one, over in here. I don't know. Now, a little bit of liquid clear. And then, back to my brush that has the Phthalo blue, the Titanium white, and a little liquid clear on it. Once again, the liquid clear is on there only, only to thin the paint. Okay, let's go up in here. And, we gotta think about a few little ripples on here. Don't want a lot, just
a few little ripples runnin' across the water. I wanna wipe off some of the color I had there. Just let that play through there. You wanna keep this transparency, zoom. Maybe there's a little watery fall, right there, a little
splash at the bottom. But now you can, you can literally look through the water and
see the rocks underneath. And to me, that's fantastic. I tried for a long time
before we developed the liquid clear, to come up with a way of doing this wet on wet. And, this is one of the
easiest, nicest ways that I've ever seen. It works. Take the liquid clear and the black gesso put together. It's unreal what you can do with it. But, isn't that neat? That you can see through this water and see the rocks underneath. There, I think that's fantastic. I'm gonna take my little, my small knife, a little white, a little black and brown mixed together. There we go. A little more black in there. And, I just wanna define this edge a little, it bothers me that it doesn't show up quite as much as I want it to. There, that's all I'm gonna do to it. Just so it stands out and you can see it, nice and plain. And, I think with that, shoot, we about got a finished painting. This is a painting that you can do, once again, even if you've never painted, this one you can do. Every day I get letters
from people that tell me their third or fourth
grade art teacher told them they had no talent. And, all their life,
they've had this desire, wanting to paint. This is one you can do. Let's sign this little
painting right here, and we'll call it finished. If you do this one, take time, take a photograph and send it to me. Let me see your results
in what you're doing. I'd love to hear from you. And, from all of us here,
I'd like to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friend. (jazz quartet music)
