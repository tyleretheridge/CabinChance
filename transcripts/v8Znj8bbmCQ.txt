- Hi, welcome back. Glad to see you today. You know, I get a lot
of letters from people saying how in the world do you come up with ideas for new paintings? And one of the ways, I
think I'll show you today. So let's start out and have them run our list of colors across the screen that you'll need to
play along with me today because I don't know
exactly what we're gonna do. And let me show you what I've got up here. I've got my standard old 18 by 24 inch pre-stretched double-prime canvas. Now say all of that with
a mouth full of rocks. And I've covered the entire canvas today with just a thin, very
thin coat of liquid clear, and I think we'll just play a little bit. A lot of times when I'm trying
to develop a new painting, I'll start out with just a blank canvas and I'll begin to play on it, and sort of let the
creative process happen. So I think that's what we'll do today. I'll show you exactly the kind of messes that we get into sometimes. So as I say, the entire canvas is covered with the liquid clear. So let's just have some fun. And we'll just start out
and maybe we'll take, I don't know, a little sap green, we'll have a little Van Dyke brown, maybe even a little black in there. We'll just mix us up a
nice, nice dark color. Maybe even put in a
little dark sienna too. We don't care, because I really don't know what we're going to do. except have some fun. Okay and let's go up to the canvas. Now this liquid clear is fantastic because it does so many things, but one of the things it does is it has a very violent reaction
with paint thinner. Let's just put in some basic
little shapes and forms here. Maybe we'll start with
a little, maybe a little indication of a little
evergreen tree that lives way back somewhere. We don't know where it lives. Something about like that. This is also a good
experience to just practice making little evergreens. Start with a fan brush, make a line, and I take just the corner of the brush. I begin touching, see? From the center out, work
it from the center out. Like so. And as you work down the tree,
add more and more pressure. Push harder and harder,
something like that. And we'll just sort of let that
fade into nothing down here. See there's some good practice on making a little evergreen tree. Now then, I want to cause
these to sort of mist and blend together. Maybe even give it a
little water color look. So I'll take a little two inch brush, and I'm gonna dip it
in some paint thinner. (tapping) And just shake it off a little bit. There's still thinner in the bristles. I have not taken it all out. But I've taken the majority of it out. You can always add a little more. Now when you begin touching
this with the paint thinner against that, beautiful
little things begin happening. Be careful that you don't get
too much thinner initially. You can always add more. But it's a son-of-a-gun to take it off. There, now we'll just take that color, and let's just begin playing here. I want to create the illusion of beautiful little misty areas that are far far away. There. Just little soft things that
live way back in the distance. I'm just gonna blend this
out til it's very fuzzy, very quiet, just a gentle
little place back here. There we go. But see how all these little
things begin happening? And we can just let this go
wherever you want it to go. Maybe just add the least little touch of paint thinner to the brush. Shake off all the excess though. Don't get too much. Once again, you can always add more. And just touch it, and
it takes just a second for the reaction to take place, but you can create
beautiful, beautiful effects. A little more of that
thinner and just touch. Very little though. Once again, experiment a little, and you'll find marvelous
things that happen. But see it almost looks
like a water color, the way it flows in there. And maybe we come back
and maybe we'll just do another little tree. We'll put a little
layer of trees in there. I don't know. We'll see where this goes. We use the old fan brush. Okay. Let's go back in here. Maybe there's one that lives
in the foreground here. See, there. Once again this is mainly
just sap green and the browns and a little black, both browns though. Maybe he's got a little friend named Clyde that lives right there, or
whatever you want to name him. I give names to my little trees and sort of make friends with them. Of course, people look at you like you're a little strange, but that's okay. Painters are expected to be different. Now, back to the paint
thinner on the brush. And I want to begin pulling
that out a little bit so it makes like another layer. This one's in front. And you can make as many or
as few layers as you want. Pretty soon here, we're
gonna have to decide where we're going with this though. You can get carried away. Ah, then I'm gonna add a little more paint thinner to the brush. That's just knocking off
any paint I've picked up. I just beat the bristles
against the easel a little bit. Now see the paint thinner? Isn't that fantastic? The beautiful effects you can create? Once again, it takes a moment
or two for this to work, for the reaction to take place, so give it a little time to set, and as it sets for an hour or two, it'll continue to sort of
spread, even a little bit more. But already, it's beginning
to give that appearance of maybe just a little water color. There we go. There, just have to splash
the camera man one time so he doesn't feel neglected. Now let's take a little filbert brush, and I'm just gonna use a little filbert. I'm gonna go into a little sap green, some of these colors, there's not a lot of paint on the brush though. Just both sides right in there. A little brown. A little dark sienna,
maybe even a little black. Still not a lot of paint. Okay, now let's go up here. Now see you can, I hold the filbert brush sort of like a pencil and you can just take and let's begin making
some big decisions in our world. Maybe there's, yeah,
maybe there's something that lives way back in here. And we just begin laying
in some very basic little, some little ideas, some little feelings. There. And you can even take your fingers and work with this to create
all kinds of illusions. Now if you don't want to use your fingers, cause it will get some paint on them, you can still use your brush. I like to use the fingers sometimes just to create effects that
are a little different, a little unique. There. But you better remember
where your fingers have been before you scratch your nose. There we go, cause I do things like that. I forget that I've been
painting on my finger and scratch my ear or something. People will be getting a laugh in then cause you've got all these
funny colors on your face. But that's alright, as long
as you enjoy what you're doing and have a good time. Look at that. It's that easy, you can
begin creating illusions of all kinds of little things
that are happening in there. Just using a finger. Okay, maybe a little more
color on that old brush here. I'm gonna add a little more dark sienna. I like that dark sienna. That's a beautiful warm color. And you can use this brush sidewards, straight on, any way that you want. Just practice with it
and scrub that paint in, and it creates all kinds
of different effects. Once again, I like to take the finger and just work that out a little bit. See? Let it go over here. We're beginning to have something that looks like maybe this
is a side of a mountain. Or a hill. I don't know. Looks pretty neat though. I sort of like it. Sort of like them a little
more of a dark color, we can outline and make some
of these a little stronger. If you want to. This is a nice way of
making a lot of little rocks and stone areas very simply. Shoot, I like that. There's already a lot of
distance and depth in there. Let's go back to our old fan brush. Get a little paint thinner on it, and I'm gonna flick a little
paint thinner in there. I want to keep this
feeling of a water color going throughout the painting, I think. I like that. Very soft, gentle little painting. But you can see how that instantly starts coming up all those little things. Isn't that fantastic? As I've mentioned before in this series, I've got a lot of letters, I'm gonna add a little
prussian blue in there, a lot of letters from people saying how in the world do you
use this liquid clear? It seems like it would be fantastic, but I don't know exactly
what to do with it. In this series, we've
really tried to show you some paintings that you
can do using liquid clear. There. Cause we have clear, black, and white, and all these things do
gorgeous, gorgeous effects, but they're all different and unique. There we go. See, now we'll make this one darker. Maybe, hmmm. Just sort of vary these colors, wherever you want them to go. Looks like a big old
stone lives right there. Now I'm gonna sort of fade
the edges out a little. And as I say, I like using my finger, but if you want to use just the filbert, that'll work just as well. Just as well. I sort of find this to
be fun once in a while, just to get in there and play like that. Pick up a little touch maybe of, ooh, a little alizarin crimson. We'll get a little crazy here. Nice little stone lives right in there. But you just put as many or as few things in your painting as you want. But this is a super way of just beginning to come up with ideas. Start with a blank canvas
and begin playing with it. Just begin playing, you can create all kinds of gorgeous things. There. Don't be afraid to experiment. Don't be afraid to go out
on a limb once in a while because you know, if you go out on a limb once in a while, that's
where the fruit is. It never grows close to the tree. It's always out on a limb. If you want to get the
fruit from the painting, go out on a limb. Take chances with your art. Enjoy it. There. You know, I gotta do this. You know me, I begin
seeing things in these. I'm gonna take a little
bit of the liquid clear, just a little liquid
clear on the fan brush, and go right into titanium white, maybe I'll get a little more clear. I'll be right back here. Let me get just a touch more. There. I want to make this paint thin. Very thin with the clear. I'm only using the
clear to thin the color. Look up here now. Right in here, I know, I know, I know, Watch here, watch here. (swooshing) A little watery fall lives right there. There he comes, see? Look at that. This is the way paintings come about. This is the way that you
create a whole new idea, and new concepts. There. Look at that. I'm sorry, I just, I get
excited about things like this. I just want to go crazy with it. Maybe, there we go. All kinds of gorgeous little things. We'll just put the
indication of more things that are happening up above
this little watery fall. Alright. Just let your imagination take you to anyplace that you want to go. Because this truly is your world here. I'll take my fan brush with a little paint thinner on it again. Just flick a little more
of the paint thinner right up there just to sort
of bring all that together. Maybe even a little down here
at the base of this waterfall. But see how it softens those edges and brings them right together? Isn't that neat? I used to work like crazy
to do things like this. And this will allow you to
do it almost effortlessly. There. There we go. Now we gotta make some big decisions. Where are we going with this? What did I do with my filbert? There it is. Let's go back and get some color. I told you this was gonna
be one of those days where we just played and had fun. But I want to get you to try
being creative on canvas, just to take your time and sit down, have nothing in mind when you start. Just have a good feeling and be happy, and love of the life and the world, and set down and start playing. And if you feel good about
yourself and the world, it'll show in your painting, and all these little things will happen. There. I'm just putting in some little, maybe some more little stones over here. Because we have to contain
this little waterfall, or it'll get out and
run all over the place. We don't want that to happen. There. We don't even know where that goes yet. We'll decide that later on. Right now we're just putting
some little stones in there to contain all this. Okay. Wipe off the old brush. Now then, I'm just gonna take my finger and fade that back. Just blend these edges out. And you can create the
illusion of highlights and shadows and all kinds of things that are happening right here. Just using your finger, that easy. There. Okay. I'm gonna go back to my little fan brush. It just has paint thinner on it. And once again, I'm gonna flick a little right along the edges here. Something like so. And maybe, maybe in our world, maybe there's a whole other layer here. Look at all the layers and
the depth we've done in here. And you can do this. As you can see, this is so easy. Even if you've never
painted, you can do this. You can do this. There. Something like so. We'll just let that fade, right? We don't know where that goes. There we are. Now then, let's go back. I have to keep wiping my finger off here. If you're painting with
it, you're gonna end up with a dirty finger. Maybe we'll have a, let's have
a little tree in our world. We can just keep using this filbert. I like it. We'll use some black, some sap green, some of the browns,
crimson, it doesn't matter. Maybe even a little of the prussian blue. Whatever, okay. Let's go up in here. Maybe in our world, let's do a little
evergreen tree right here. We'll just paint it with this. It doesn't matter. You can just take this brush and just begin putting all
kinds of little limbs and just sort of dob along. We'll come back and put a few
little highlights in there. There. Nice dark tree that lives
right up here in all this. There we go. And maybe, let's put
a little color in here for our background. I'm even gonna pick up a
little of that tree color. Just sort of want this
to fade out, I think. Something about like that. We'll just let that fade
right on into nothing. There. I really do enjoy doing this. And for a long time,
I've wanted to show you some of the ways that
we create new paintings. And this is one of the ways right here. Right here. Okay, back to my little fan brush that has the paint thinner. Now I'm gonna flick this. See, there's really not much here, but I want to flick it
a lot and just let it sort of be a nice soft little background. Look at that. See there? It just sort of gives
a hint or a suggestion of something going on in there. Let's take a little,
we'll use a little blue and a little alizarin crimson. Maybe I'll make a little lavender color. And once again, I'm just
using my finger here, but the brush would work just as good. I've got into using the finger. Whoo that's gorgeous. And I like that today. Just like doing that. You know, this painting, already, almost has an oriental flair to it. Sort of has like an oriental flair. It's interesting because
talking about that, our show now is being
played all over the world. And recently, it started playing in Japan, and it's just, oh it's fantastic. We have so many fantastic friends there, and they're enjoying the show, and it's working well for them, and we had one lovely lady who decided she wanted to be an instructor, and she came here all the way from Japan just to learn to be an instructor. And this is Misuko Tada,
and she's our first Japanese instructor. I have to show you some of her classes that she has going there. We had some photographs here, and I wanted to show these to you. She has some fantastic classes and she's teaching hundreds of people all over Japan the joy of painting. Isn't that something? So people all over the world,
there's a common denominator. Everyone loves to paint. Everyone, even the young people. We have so many young friends, and they too enjoy this. There we go. I'm gonna have to go to
Japan pretty soon, I think, and meet some of these fantastic painters. They're just so exciting. There. Maybe we'll go back to the brush. Maybe we'll put something right in here. And we don't know what it is. Maybe I'm just sort of let this fade off on the side over here. Like that. Maybe, maybe there's
another old tree over here. I'm just sort of bouncing around and sort of deciding what looks right and wrong, and where I want things. When you do yours, just sort of watch, and look at it and see
what's happening in it. Because everybody's
painting will look different especially if you're doing
a painting like this. Because we really don't have any set idea of where we're going with this. We're just sort of letting it happen. Take a little brown and white. Maybe just put the
indication here and there of a little tree trunk. Not looking for a lot of
detail, but just a little. And take a little yellow
ochre, a little cad yellow. Make a little green just to
put a touch of highlight. I don't want this to be too strong. I think I'll keep these
colors quite muted. There we go. Just enough to give it
a hint, just a hint. Shoot, maybe in our world, maybe there's another old trunk. This old tree, maybe he had a
bad time and pooped out on us, but he still lives up here on the rock. And let's see, maybe
there's a little light shining through there. A little arm sticking out. There. Alright. Now then. Down in here, I'm gonna
go back to the finger. I like to blend with that. You can make some most interesting shapes and color combinations. There we go. I want it to fade right on out down here. Almost to nothing. There. Something about like that. By changing the angle of
some of these strokes, you can create the illusion
of highlights and shadows and all of these gorgeous little things. Just practice a little with it. I think you'll find this is
a unique way of painting. Back to our little paint
thinner on the brush, and I'm gonna flick the bottom of this. As I say, I'm gonna do this
through the entire painting, I think, just to keep this feel. Sort of a watery color feel. Once in a while, I'll put a lot on an area and allow it to actually drip, cause it makes a very nice effect. And it'll drive people crazy that you show your paintings to. They'll go nuts trying to
figure out how in the world did you do such a thing? There we go. Now then, let's take
an old two inch brush. I'm gonna go right into a
little bit of titanium white. Maybe the least little touch, this is a little lavender color. It's sort of got a little crimson in it, and a little bit of
blue, but not much color. Mostly white. Let's go up in here,
and let's just take that and begin bouncing in like it's, maybe there's just the indication of some foamy water back here. White, a little bit of the prussian blue. Just sort of vary this a little bit. There we go, and just
sort of bounce it in. There. Alright. Just let all these little things happen. I don't want a lot of detail here. I don't really want to
know where this goes. I want to retain this
soft water color look. Something like that. Just very soft and very misty. Sort of a just secret little place. This is just a lot of mist out here. There. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. Let's go back to all of our old colors. We had the browns and the black. Maybe over in here, yep you're right, there lives another big old stone. Right there. Just work the bottom of him out a little. Maybe, maybe he's got a
friend, lives right there. Let that just sort of fade off. We don't know where that goes. I don't want very sharp edges on here. I like this softness that
just sort of happens. Alright, maybe, and we're just varying these colors back and
forth, back and forth. Fade it over on this side. There. Isn't that neat how you
can do things like that? There we go. Maybe about in here. Alright. You know me, you know me. I got to have a big tree. We'll just continue to use this. Maybe our big tree lives right here in front of the, right there, right there. And I don't want my
old tree to get lonely. Shoot, let's give him a friend. He has a friend now, lives right there. Take a little bit of sort of a gray color. We'll just put a little touch of highlight right down the edge, just so it looks like
there's a little light shining through there. Something about like so. Then we can just work this on out. Something like that. I really hope you try
these kind of paintings. It will allow you freedom to just experiment, and don't
be afraid to experiment, once again, that's where
some of the best ideas in the world come from. It's just experimenting and having fun and enjoying your art and
enjoying your time with yourself. Or if you do it with a friend or a spouse, it's a good time together. Okay, back to our brush that
has the paint thinner on it, and let's just flick all this too. Shoot, I like that flicking. Just give it a little flick. And maybe, maybe our tree, go in some sap green here. Maybe there's a few little limbs hanging out here on our tree. There. Just a few. I don't want too many because I don't want to lose all this nice background. Something about like
that, just here and there. Just indications, maybe we even have a few little indications of
some little bushy things that live out here. There. As I say, this is something
that I really hope you try because it's so much fun,
and it works so well, and it's so easy. Maybe on our tree, here, there are a few old limbs hanging out like so, wherever you
think they should be. A couple hanging out in here. A few little sticks and twigs
that live right back in here. See there? Just all kinds of little things. Take a little touch of the yellow ochre, just to spice it up a
little, right in here. Maybe a little touch
of the bright red, ooh, just to give it a little fire in there. Shoot, I sort of like that. I think we're gonna
call that painting done. I really hope you try this because it'll teach you creativity, and it'll allow you to express yourself. From all of us here, I'd like
to wish you happy painting, and God bless, my friend. (calm music)
