welcome back glad you could join me today I hope you're having a fantastic day you got your paints out you ready to paint along with me I think you're going to enjoy this one let's start off and have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with me while they're doing that let's go on up here and get started I've already covered the canvas and liquid white and it's all wet and ready to go so we can we can take right off today go start right off with a little touch of the Prussian blue just a little bit just tap the brush ride into it just a little reach over here and grab a little bit of the midnight black case go ahead up here now then let's just dance in some happy little some little sky things here just use a little little X's little crisscross strokes just sort of let that go just have fun with it just have fun another the paint will mix with a liquid white and automatically automatically it'll get lighter in value as you work down toward the horizon there may be a little touch more right there okay and that click you can have a basic little sky in just a little blue sky and then very lightly we just fresh across take out the brushstrokes okay man then let's take another brush I have several going so I don't have to spend all my time washing them let's go into titanium white we'll make a happy little cloud pull it brush through the paint I'm going to reach down and get a least little touch of the bright red just the least little touch a lot of pain in the bristles here okay let's just come right up here and dance in a happy little cloud or two and I'm just using the brush in small little circular patterns here tiny little circles let the bristles work let them let him build your cloud for you you're looking for all those nice soft fluffy edges oh this is a fantastic day clouds are playing in the sky just let them bounce around forever you think they should be that's exactly exactly where they ought to be okay wash that brush out hey we just grab a brushing odorless thinner paint thinner shake off the excess and then just take out all your frustrations okay now with a clean dry brush very dry if you have trouble drying the brush you probably can't beat it like I can in your living room or wherever your paint because you would cover everything they make of a thing called a brush beater racket you can put in the bottom of a waste paper can garbage can or something and you can shake your brush inside the cannon beetle against this rack and that keeps it contained so it doesn't go all over your house you might might want to have one of those if you're going paint inside there we go okay choo we got us a quick little sky that easy now then let's take it maybe back in the background here we'll put a let's put a few little bushes and trees back here we'll take some dark sienna some Van Dyke Brown and I'm using the round brush I'm just going to tap this color right into it pick up a black tube what the heck little SAP green tap firmly to load the brush okay let's go ahead up here now then decide where you want your little bushes to live these are distant trees and just very quickly just tap in some basic shapes very very basic shapes you're not looking for any detail all you're looking for is just basic shapes however many you want okay and then with the same nail brush let's go right into a little touch of Oh we'll use some yellow ochre I'm gonna reach up here be right back get a little bit of the SAP green a little CAD yellow and once again I'm just tapping it in allowed that color to stay on the brush because I want to I want to doll all this okay let's go right up here now then just the top bristles you can put in all types of little highlights here and and see how easy that is just tap on it and we're still not looking for a great deal of detail if you have if you have troubles making the paint stick add a little paint thinner but all you need is a tiny little bit tiny little bit don't overdo with a paint thinner tiny little bit see and make layers that'll create the illusion of depth look at that all those little things there's just thousands of little leaves there and you can do it in just a matter of a minute or two that easy okay let's have a little pond under there that's easy to do and a lot of fun you know me I love water go back to my brush it had the blue in the black on it and we can just come right across that easy like the indication have a little touch of water and if you wanted to reflect all these little bushes that you made you can take the same brush just turn it upside down tap downward like that and put in some basic basic ideas there we're not looking for a great deal of detail now take your 2 inch brush and pull gently down this is two hairs and some air just barely barely touching and go across in hand Neath instant reflections that easy and easy as we can take a little of the Browns dark sienna Van Dyck just mix them together I love that very flat cut across get that little roll of paint out here on the knife and let's go right up in here let's put a little land back here I'm just going to sort of scrub that in there we go just to give the indication of a little land the tough lives back here there we go just some Robles trees to set off and you can take a little of the liquid white a little brown in it to dull it cut across and just put it in the indication of a little water line here I don't want this to be too bright and shiny because it's it's going to be too far back in the painting and I don't want to distract them whatever it is we put in the foreground okay spill some more trees I like them trees same ole round brush we'll go back into the Browns reach over here now get a little bit blue little of the SAP green oh shoot you might have some black - whatever basically we're looking for dark colors okay let's go back up here now then I want a bigger tree here but I still want to start at the base and work up so it's darker down in here down here we have all these shadows this is where little bunny rabbit hides see and as we work up here we're going to pick up the paint us on the canvas and automatically it gets lighter in value learn to use what happens don't fight it the spring is right on down we just push that little pond right on back into the into the background baby yeah let's let's just keep going here these trees are so much fun to make all we're looking for at this point is the basic shapes just basic shapes so just sort of look around your yard and see the kind of trees you have it if that's what you want to paint and paint that initial shape and then we'll come back and we'll highlight those trees and put all the little leaves and all the little pretty things into it but initially are you looking for is just the basic shape and normally it's always darker down here at the base that is at the top just tapping all we're doing is tapping very easy can you must load our brush again maybe right in here yeah what the heck let's just push this lake way back if we do that just by putting some bushes right here I'm not careful I'm just gonna cover that little rascal it and the plants will dry on that there all right mmm-hmm use our liner brush remember to script liner and I go right into some of that brown color load the brush full you want your paint to be very thin let's go right up in here and touch and we just make the indication of a few little tree trunks here now we're going to put leaves all these trees so we're going to lose most of these things so you don't have to put a whole bunch of detail in here save your detail for the foreground there we go just some happy little things you're gonna see a few little trunks and limbs here and there so okay a fantastic you can build a tree that easy all right in a few little things wherever wash out my little brush and then let's take a round brush and we'll go right into some yellow and some yellow ochre ochre that we reach up here again I just slip off and leave you some time to come back a little green on their little SAP green tap the brush pull up color casts go right up here now then go slightly above the dark and just begin tapping on all those little all the little leaves and stuff there in there see there and once again don't just throw them on at random make little patterns cause there's looms that project out every which way there we go I had a little yellow ocher right in there just that all these little things happen some on this tree we don't want him left out there we go there we go and over here so do one tree at a time they'll remember each one of these little trees and bushes they're individuals they each have their own separate personality there and a little touch the bright red right to see how nice that makes that one and just pick out places you think there's a bush and that's where he lives that's where you live okay I had a little thinner to my brush there that'll make the paint stick easier there so now that one see now here we have two that are exactly the same color the only thing that separates them is that little dark area that little dark area is very valuable when you're painting don't kill all the darks save them little rascals they're your friends they'll make you happy you'll make your paintings beautiful beautiful beautiful okay there's a nice one it looks like it has little flowers on top that's one them happy accidents cherish them don't fight them huh now see all the dark it's left back here without that there would be no depth absolutely no depth it'd be as flat as if you cut it out a newspaper just glued it up there and you would not be happy with it there we go all right I'll stop I'm gonna cover up the whole canvas here with all these happy little trees okay okay now then you can take the knife and just take the point of the knife scrape right through the paint let some of the white shine through and make all kinds of little limbs and twigs all the things it takes to hold up all these little clumps of bushes and grass and that's all trees and all those things just by scratching through the paint see that's is that easy okay test some fun let's have some fun we'll take some brown and then go right into SAP green put the brown and there just to build a green down I want to be very dark very dark okay let's go ahead up in here now just by tapping I want to tap in some dark color all I'm doing is just tapping downward okay browns and greens and throw some black in there here's where we begin thinking about the lay of the land in other words the direction the land flows we need this dark color so that we can come along and highlight didn't put grass on it and it'll stand out it's only way you can make that stand out as if you have dark underneath light against light gives you nothing the dark against dark gives you mapping gotta have dark canary to see light just like in life you have to have a few of those dark day so you understand when you have a good one otherwise they'll just sneak by and you never notice it there we go look at all those little things that just happened already it's ready you can see how the land flows here and that's what we're trying to do okay I can give us a a base coat to work with now then same old brush I want this color very dark I want to go back in here and put just the indication of a little bit of highlight don't want much back here I'll show you why in a minute I just made a decision see when you paint you have unbelievable power unbelievable power you have to make big decisions I just made a decision just made a big decision I'm gonna have a happy little building right here so come right down here in this watch first you have to make a decision where your buildings gonna live and one of the easiest ways is to take your knife and begin scraping out the general shape that you want this building to be maybe there's the roof like so see there this removes that excess paint back here and allows you without being committed to lay your building out you can you can just change the shape any way you want it because at this point you're not committed maybe it's got a little roof it comes out this way who knows scrape out all this paint when you're at home at this point step back take a look see see if it's what you want it helps to stand away from your canvas and look at it okay now we can begin filling it in here we've got a basic idea what we want now then let's take start with Van Dyke Brown a little roll of paint I'll always use that little roll of paint and that's just fill in the squares go I'll just put that right in see how easy that is just drop it right in just like so right out through there we're gonna have it okay a little bit right here pull down down so we're still keeping a basic idea we're not committed yet I can do anything that we want to do back in here but we're still keeping the basic idea in mind there we go what a twist it was that easy to build a house in real life now there let's begin putting some fun things on now take some dark cnn's bright red and reach over here and get some titanium white and don't overmix leave it leave it about like that grab it and let's come right down here I'll put a little touch of highlight right along that edge see that'll indicate there's a little something good on the other side the roof now let's take some white grab some of that blue and some Brown we just mix all that together make sort of a bluish gray we'll throw some black in there well that's nice a nice shadow color once again a little roll of paint now there now then just let this sort of bounce along here OOP OOP OOP don't make any noise it don't work okay now you really do have to start making some big decisions where is this little this is gonna be a little you have to start deciding her itself maybe there's a little light place through hands a little highlight it bounces along here see that see that that meet and you can do that you really can do that over here I'll take just a little touch of a light color and just Sparkle Etsy sled roof stands out maybe little lights really zing in right through there that'll sort of give us an idea of just where the roof line is see okay now we can come in here and really start playing dark Sienna we'll just go right back in there pull that out a little roll of paint again there now that touch no pressure no pressure barely barely barely caress the canvas no pressure no pressure at all I want to make us look old and tired shoot us alike me okay a little bit right in here see there at this side over here we want it a very dark very dark very dark so we'll take some dark sienna and Van Dyke Brown and just a tiniest little bit of white we want to keep this side very dark as much lights kind of strike over here okay now then this is just a little bit of brown and we can come right down in here and we can make all kinds of old boards and say make it look old old a little just that easy you can put little sparklers here in there the touches of white can really get in here and make this look like old old wood just whatever you think it should be that's where it would be okay we need a door I've been known to paint barns and cabins and forget to put a door in them but let's put one right here just van take brown and pull it down straight down so you have to do a little bit of color cut around it and easy tell you what shoot with him so much fun of this watch here watch here watch here maybe this guy maybe he's like me runs out a room continually and he had to build a shed right out here see just pull that out come straight down over here this will be lighter in that super come along here put a few little bored indications in there and that easy you got a happy little shed and you can put a little this color right on the roof to make it sort of separate stand out a little highlight right along there OOP and we have or we have one nice little barn and maybe watch it right Nick come right up in here let me show you something maybe you want to create the illusion that this is an overhang you can come right back in here I'm will waste all my time playing with this barn but there's so many things I want to show you here see you can cut that off and it make this very dark see now watch it watch what we back in there we need a little bit of shadow little shadow now we come along here and put some post highlight those little post just touch okay enough playing I gotta gotta get to move in here I get carried away sometime these little buildings are so much fun to make let's come right along in here put some little grassy things that live right out come right in okay let me find my little knife use a little knife for this maybe right in here a little fence loop-the-loop off it goes right up into the distance wherever wherever where see a little wire right across there that easy push everything back now there's a little place a little place where the farmer can store stuff up underneath there and we put a little touch of thinner on there the yellows a little green okay now then let's begin creating all the little grassy things that we want in here just wherever you want wherever you want this is where you really really really make the lay of the land work okay maybe right over in here  it all those little things see how easy there you just drop them in just drop them in tell you what let's do maybe there's a little road in there take just Van Dyke Brown decide where your road lives and pull it that easy stand easy we just fill up the whole canvas what the heck what the heck man little bit of brown and white touch it touch it and pull yep yep yep yep okay see there now maybe maybe there's a little path it comes out and you can just go crazy in your world you put whatever you think ordered either a bit of paint right there and bring a little bit of the grassy thanks right down so it brings all this together see how simple so big brush does fantastic things fantastic thing then over here on this side of the path we need some more little grassy areas to bring all this together let's bring it all together look at that back it down hmmm that quick you can you can create all of this beautiful land mass just by tapping a little bit with a big brush and maybe watch right here maybe do we put a fence put a little fence touch a highlight on it cut across a little bit of paints and then we put somewhere on that fence dude you can do anything you can do absolutely anything let's take some Brown here watch your watch maybe their lives he sure does big ol tree the little tree just like it just like that let's put some highlight on that tree see see there yes pull that around a little more this looks like a little birch tree to cut here in front of the bar and with our liner brush a little bit of thinner we can go right up in here take a very thin paint unless that's what the indication of a happy little tree limb here in there just here in there wherever you want the old clock on the wall tells me it's time to leave you for today but I'll be back again next time so as I finish putting these limbs on here I'd like to wish you happy painting god bless thanks for joining me Oh ah you
