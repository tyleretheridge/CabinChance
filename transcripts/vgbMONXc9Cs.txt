welcome back glad you could join me today you know they say that time really goes by when you're having fun and here we find ourselves on our last show of this series so I thought today you know since I lived in Alaska so long I'd do a special Alaskan painting so if you come on up here to canvas I'll tell you what we've already done now I've taken a black canvas as you can see now we painted this with just a flat black acrylic paint allow that to dry and then on top of that I've put all different kinds of transparent colors I've put some right and here's some alizarin crimson over in here some phthalo green they little blue and green mixed all over the canvas so it's completely covered with a thick paint so it's all ready to go so let's have them graphically run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint this project with me and I think today we'll do some Northern Lights so come on up here unless let's get started I want to use the old fan brush today so probably one of the best ways to do this is sort of take and you can just on this black canvas you can draw in some basic shapes and if you've never seen the Northern Lights a lot of times they're in what they call curtains or just layers now if in your part of the country there's no such thing as northern lights you can do the same scene leave the lights out and maybe put a little moon in this guy and it'll be just as effective but once again for my friends in Alaska today I want to do a Northern Lights picture start with the old fan brush right into titanium white now we already have all those beautiful colors on the canvas so all we need is white does go up here now decide where these curtains or these lights are gonna be and just begin tapping see all I'm doing is just tapping and tapping the color in and make your basic shapes just very basic shapes and a little more paint where you want to be a little brighter we have one coming right across here and I'm just tapping titanium white on there sometimes there's little ridges and they put balance around it that counts just right on the round right down around it we will have three layers of Lights in this painting and you can have as many as you want or as few as you want it's up to you up to you now then this is where the fun starts let's take a one inch brush and I'm gonna begin grabbing this and lifting it upward just grab it and pop it just pop it up already you can see it begin picking up some of the different colors and here like so this one Johnny Horton wrote a beautiful song but Northern Lights boy didn't lights were running wild in the land of the Midnight Sun and I lived there for over a dozen years and that has to be that has to be one of the prettiest countries in the world God was really having a good day when he made Alaska now then I'm gonna take the 2 inch brush and go all the way through this and lift up all the way through follow the same angles all the way look at that there are you going you can pull these as high as you want them and some parts of the country they don't see a lot of color in Northern Lights they see maybe only White's or yellows and you can do yours at play where I lived right outside of Fairbanks in a little town called North Pole sometimes we would see lights in every color in the rainbow makes it a little more interesting so I figured if I did a bunch of colors you would find your color too here somewhere okay you see now right in here this is where the crimson was you have sort of a lavender feel in here and blue and here over here there's a little phthalo green mixing with if they low blue make some beautiful beautiful colors in the sky let's wash the old brush give it a shake this beat the devil out of it and no painting of Alaska would be complete without an almighty mountain take a little bit of black put a little brown in there very dark pull it out flat cut across get that little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife okay let's go up here you have to make the big decision where's your mountain to live right there takes a very little paint because the canvases are just black put little bumps and hills and valleys whatever you want in your mountain she just drop it in there like so and scrape off all the excess paint you really really can't scrape too hard then go take a large brush grab it and pull this just basically removes excess paint the more of this paint that you can get off but easier the next layer is distinct let's take off all of it you can get off this is also an excellent way using brush strokes to begin letting out your highlights and shadows see see how you can pull all kinds of effects there maybe you want to have and you're not committed you can just keep changing this and playing with it maybe you want a little shadow you can see there that's that easy to find out how your highlights and shadows were looking there pull it through or you just keep going spend all day just play in there okay now then let's use our old knife I'm going through the titanium white and a little bit of blue just a small amount of blue there just just enough to ten it okay pull it out from very flat as flat as you can get it get tough with it and come across get that a little roll of paint right over the edge of the knife just go back up here now then let's have some snow just coming right down the side of this moment wherever you want it to go no pressure no pressure at all just let it flow you want that paint to break all these little holes listen there you go see and you can wiggle that knife and cause all kinds of little effects to happen let it go can you write up here on the top we want a little bit of snow right up here there it comes right damn maybe joins together you have to make big decisions here maybe there's some light striking right over here on that little Ridge let's begin with our shadows for the shadows gonna take blue and white mix it together maybe we'll make it a little bit lighter still a little dark for what I want that's much better cut across it our little world of pain again okay now then no pressure no pressure just let it barely caress the canvas yeah just begin elating of all kinds of little things anywhere you want a little Ridge just drop it in this is your painting dear world you can do anything that you here little bit right back here see now we can take this one and pull it distinctly through and it pushes that one right back hmmm do you know you had that kind of power could you push a mountains around why did I go home only thing push around the chair but here I can push around to anything from the mountains and trees and rivers there we go put a happy little Pete Freddy's hair now we're using a very firm paint here we want this point to be as firm as possible okay now see this little point here it needs to have its own private shadow it doesn't have its own check and it won't stand out like an individual and you can just bounce it back and forth here and pull a chute look at there baby baby there's another one there's right there as many or as few as you want in your world is your creation but each one of them see here now once again right here we need to have another shadow there we go all the time this is mixing with that beautiful color this underneath it allows all kinds of things to happen you know let's take a clean dry two inch brush and I'm going to gently gently tap following the angles in the mountain always follow your ankles and tap more down here at the base then you do up here up here you just barely want to whisper it down at the bottom you want to tap it a little bit harder if you would get into collecting some paint on your brush just take beat the devil out of it and that'll remove the excess picking right off your brush without going through a lot of cleaning yeah Soph has to get into them over here if you follow these angles always pay attention to the angles in your mouth and that's what you're looking for they're very gently lift upward this takes out all those little tap marks softens balloons creates the illusion of mist just like so fantastic okay yeah we can play some more that's fine as a fan brush I think we'll just go right into this mixture we had before we made the mountain with it it was black they look blue little vendek Brown just mix them on the brush load that brush full of paint look at all the paint's in there just go back up here maybe there's some happy little trees live back here huh these are far away and all we're looking for it's just little indications a little evergreens that are far back in the distance get a little more paint so you're using the top part of that brush and just tap downward that's all there is to it hey you don't want to kill all this misty area you kill this mist it's right up here all little happened is these trees will run right into the mountain you wanted to stay separated so don't kill you misty area save them they're precious the good friends right here in this mountain everything they do your best friends so cherish him so now if you get these two far apart they're gonna begin looking like fence post so if you if your little evergreens that are far in the distance begin looking like fence post chances are you just don't have enough I had a few more and see if it didn't doesn't help take care of that little problem not easy we get some happy little evergreen definitely you back here in the distance all the way across yeah then we can take another fan brush you know I have I have several of them going here so I don't have to don't have to continually wash him we take a little blue and white this was just a little the shadow color is left over let's go up here I want to just pop in some indication of some happy little tree trunks just on the bottom touch it pull it straight up touch pull straight up very lightly very just enough to create a little little light area down here at the base of these trees just makes them a little prettier so you're playing light against dark dark against light continually potato that's what painting is all about baby hey we back here in the distance we can start playing with a little detail we'll take that same old black color just a lot of paint in the brush just black blue a lot of paint look at there that the brushes are really full okay let's go right up in here yeah we just pop in a few little little bushes don't want to kill all the little little tree trunk areas that you made there you see that little light area now is your separator to divider just like so yeah then I'll go back to this fan brushes get mainly white on it can you take what I'm gonna do and when I have it the least little touch of the liquid white to it to make it a little thinner just go back up here nothing I want some I want some bright things happening here so I'm gonna take this and begin pushing upward accrete just some happy little grassy areas back here allow it to mix with that color it's underneath all the blues and blacks crates all kinds of little things there we go maybe comes right along in there whatever you want maybe there's one out there will have this will go up just sort of make a decision let it happen yeah then let's take a 2 inch brush and I'm just gonna tap it into a little of the titanium white just just gently tap it you see okay let's go up here yeah I want a happy little reflection to live right underneath here oh you need his wife because the color is already on the canvas let's pull it straight down straight down and start where you want it to be the brightest and then work outward in both directions and automatically it'll get darker as it works away from that area now with a clean brush pull it down firmly like so let's pull it straight down and then go lightly across look at that I don't take a little bit of liquid quite and a little bit of titanium white and mix it together pull it out flap let's get a little roll of paint on the knife tiny to the roll there it is and let's go up here and just put the indication of a little snow it's laying right along the base of it and just barely touching the canvas just barely touching it allow it to mix with that covers underneath don't fight these I don't know just let them happen there we are okay that maybe tell you what let's play a little the blue in the black on the fan brush maybe right here an evergreen that's a little bigger he's a little touch closer I'm gonna drop him in right there just like that and he lives right out there but give him a little friend we don't even meet lonely he's just sitting right here watching the northern lights or aurora borealis whatever you want to call it easier to take Northern Lights I'm gonna take a little touch of that blue and white mixture loaded on the fan brush and come right along here I just put the indication of a few little highlights these trees are far away I don't want too many if you get too many just take your dark paint go right back over me leaned it or right up all right all right now then let's have some fun let's put in some bigger trees same old color just use the blue and black mix it well okay let's go right up here maybe yep I see a big tree that there's right there start with just the corner of the fan brush work it back and forth back and forth and as you work down the tree add more and more pressure down here you're getting tough oh you're really taking out all your frustrations down here banging there's another tree here see nothing everything's like people I've known so many fantastic friends with painting I think everything's got to have friends trees and bushes and everything needs friends everybody needs a friend I'm going on the other side over here let's get crazy I want one that goes way up and goes all the way through this Northern Light now there's as many different ways to paint Northern Lights as there are painters this is just one interpretation and this is what they look like to me who are they it really makes a beautiful painting and these black canvases when you change the light source the painting changes you put this under three different lights and you'd almost you'd almost believe you had three different paintings it changes that much it's almost unbelievable and at home try these black canvases with any transparent color I've got letters that have asked me how do I tell what color is transparent there's a very very simple test fact I tell you why the cameras right there I'll show you take a color like blue bring the camera right in here so we can see see if you take this blue and rub it on here that still looks black that color is transparent and then let's take a color okay let's use bright red that's a very opaque color now when you put it there whoo see what happens that color is not transparent it will not do for what we're trying to do here that's a good test of course now we got a red spot on the canvas hey paint another tree tree he's cover up a multitude of sins we'll have another one yeah okay we'll get a one-inch brush we'll use it for a little bit take a same color the blue into black we'll grab a little bit of this lighter color and put it in there pull that brush in one direction the loaded full of paint so very dark blue James go ahead up here now maybe we're gonna have some happy little snow-covered bushes so all we're doing it's just beginning to lay in some of the very basic shapes you're not looking for detail yet only very basic shapes very basic okay let's go right over in here maybe there's a happy Bush yep that's right tear comes right now or just wherever you want wherever you want can have as many or as few just just let your imagination take you if you've never been to Alaska you know where to go see it it's almost unreal I was born and raised in Florida I was almost 20 years old before I ever saw snow and my favorite uncle Uncle Sam he sent me up there in January thought that would be funny and it was funny I I got off the plane the first thing I did was stepped on the ice and fell on my bottom because I didn't know how to walk on ice I'm taking some liquid white and going right into titanium Hoyt pull it in one direction I'm gonna put a little tiny bit of blue in it one direction look at all the painters on that brush it's a really full okay let's go up there now then you begin picking out or all these little bushes live and just barely touch give it a little push and create all these little snow-covered bushes and Alaska they have ice fog and ice fog occurs normally when it's about 30 below or colder and it covers everything everything with frost it is so beautiful trees look like they're in full foliage it's so beautiful in the light place through it and these all these little ice-covered frosty things they act like prisms and they break up the light and you see all colors in the trees and the dead of winter you can see just you have to go see it I can't can't explain it all to you so pretty but there's a nice Bush just grows right out of that brush we'll put another one right there there they go let's drop them in just half the little bushes happy little bushes there well with the completion of this painting this will Enda at the eighth joy of painting series it's hard for me to believe it we have over a hundred shows now over a hundred shows hmm taking a little blue here put a little highlight on these trees I really hope you've got to see all the shows if there's any of them that you've missed you'd like to see them give your station to call I don't know I don't know what you want to see and when they need some help give them a hand there we are let's go over to this tree told him to be left out just hearing their don't kill all the dark contrast that's what makes it pretty and you know me I gotta have a little cabin in here so maybe with all this paint I have on here I'm gonna scrape out just the basic shape to get rid of that loose paint it's also a good way to layout you your initial cabin shape start with a little bit of vendek Brown and I'll mix some dark sienna right in that I've just mix them together hold it across a little friend on that cabin here you know and as we're winding down this series I'd like to take just a minute and thank the people here at the television station we have one of the finest crews in the country and they they make some of these beautiful television shows and you never see them you may never they never get a thank you if it wasn't for them they wouldn't there wouldn't be any show a little bit of brown and white here just put some highlight on him give him a little taller yeah tell you why let's put some snow up here on his roof just like so and it gives us a quick little cabin we can just bring some snow right down Mike Landess see how easy it is put some snow over here on the other side the roof we don't want that one to be left out but that wherever you want it okay maybe sounds coming there just like see and pay attention to your angles when you're playing the snowing angles are very important very important put all kinds of little snow things here okay let's go back in here pick up some of the liquid point go right into my titanium height owed to brush for and this pop a few more little bushes right in working layers completing the most distant part of your painting first and working forward just like so see little bushy things over in here and we're on the verge of having a completed painting take the knife scratch - these two twigs show and this one's about done once again I'd like to thank you for being with me during this eight joy of painting series we have the ninth series under production already so we'll see you again from all of us here happy painting [Music]
