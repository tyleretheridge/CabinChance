- Hi, welcome back. I'm glad to see you today. I'm very glad you could join me. Today, I think we'll do a
fantastic little painting that I think will make you happy
and do good things for you. I'm gonna have them graphically run all the colors across the screen, and they'll come across your
screen in the same order that I have them on my palette, starting with the white and going around. And while they're doing
that, let's go up here and let's do a fantastic
painting together. Gonna start today with a
little bit of thalo blue, and just work it into the bristles. There we go, and let's add to that a little bit of Van Dyke
brown, just to dull it down. So, we have thalo blue and Van Dyke brown. We'll go up to the canvas, and we'll just drop a
happy little sky in here. Just using little crisscross strokes. Just work it around, let it play. Have fun. There we are. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) Okay. Now, we've already covered the
canvas with magic white so, the color is mixing with the magic white and automatically gets lighter toward the horizon as we're painting. Isn't that easy? We have a very basic, quick little sky in. And while I have this
dirty color on the brush, tell you what, we'll just take, I'll add a little more
brown, little more blue. And let's go right down here. And we'll just do that. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) There we go. Okay, now I'll clean the brush. And we clean our brushes
with odorless paint thinner. (brush handle clanks) And there's a screen in
the bottom of my can. (gentle, rapid clanging) And I scrub the brush against that screen, and that removes the solid
particles from the brush and keeps your paint
thinner relatively clean. Now, with a clean brush,
we can just blend this out. Just like so. Let it go, let it go. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) And let's put a happy little
cloud or two in the sky. What the heck, what the heck. And today, maybe we'll put a little cloud in the sky using the one-inch brush. And we'll just pull that
brush through the paint, load a lot of paint, a lot of paint. Put a little permanent red into it. That'll brighten it up, little sunshine. Okay, let's go up the canvas here. And maybe there's a
beautiful little cloud, and he lives right there. Little tiny circles with the brush. And don't stay in one
spot, keep working it. Don't want to create the
big cotton balls in the sky. We want fluffy, happy, little clouds. Just let it work around
here and play, have fun. Okay, maybe right up here
there's another little cloud, and it comes right down. Wherever you want them, wherever. Okay, maybe you don't want
this side to get lonely, so we just drop one right here. That'll give you a little practice making these little clouds. They're a lot of fun. A lot of fun. And let's go back and take a large brush, and very lightly, very lightly here, I'm just gonna blend
the bottom out a little. Let all these colors blend together. Don't overwork these. Just blend it a little, get away from it. It shouldn't look finished at this point. There we go. Now, we'll fluff it up. Just lift it. Maybe we'll fluff this one this way, whichever, whichever. Lift it up, fluff it out. And then very lightly, very lightly, just caress the canvas lightly. See, isn't that easy? That easy. You can make some very effective,
beautiful little clouds. Okay. I'm gonna wash this brush real quick. (thudding) (gentle, rapid clanging) And let's take a fan brush today, and we'll have some fun. Maybe we'll put a little
thinner on the fan brush, and I'm going to go right into a little bit of thalo
blue and alizarin crimson. And we'll just mix this on the brush. Blue, crimson, put a
little small amount of white in there so we can
see what color we get. And I'm looking for a lavender color, more into the blue hue. Little bit more blue than crimson. Okay, but the paint is quite thin here. Let's go up to the canvas. Maybe there's some
distant little trees that live way back here. And we'll just tap, tap, tap. And just lay them little rascals in there, wherever you want them, wherever. These are very far away, very soft. Don't want too much detail. Just drop them in. Like so. That's all there is to it. Just let it happen. Okay now, I'm gonna add a
little more of the crimson. I'm gonna go a little more
into the crimson side. Just to break it up so it's
not all one flat color. Maybe right there. Right there. Just let these little things happen. Let them come right out of your brush. Now, we're not looking
for detail once again, we're really just looking for
some background shapes here. And wherever you think they should be, that's where they are to be. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Okay, now, I want to
create some mist in here, so I'll take the large brush and just tap the bottom of this. And this is quite firm. I'm hitting the canvas
pretty hard right here. (rapid, scratchy tapping) Let's make a nice, soft, misty appearance. And let a little of
that go up into the sky, so it looks like little leaf
trees that are far, far away. Far away. And I'm gonna lift up. Just to soften that mist
and bring it together. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) Isn't that easy? That easy. We've got a nice little background. And with the same old dirty brush, let's add to that color. Let's add some Van Dyke brown, and some burnt umber. And I'm just mixing these on the brush. Lot of paint, a lot of paint. Okay, let's go up to the canvas here. And maybe, maybe, maybe,
maybe, there it is. Right there. Maybe there's a tree here that you can make out a little more detail. This paint's still quite thin. (gentle, scratchy tapping) There. Thin paint will stick to a thick paint. See there. Add a little sap green to that, too. There, good, good, nice. Just let these little things happen. There. Maybe right there. There he is, there he is. Just let these come
right out of your brush. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Maybe there's a bigger one here. This is your world, so wherever
you want a tree or a bush, that's where it ought to be. Drop it in. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Now, I'm gonna take that
old, big brush again, and just tap the bottom. I want to soften this also. I want this to be a very
soft, quiet painting. (rapid, scratchy tapping) There. It's unbelievable the way you can create beautiful, beautiful misty
effects, and so simple. I used to work myself to death
trying to make misty effects, and it's easy. And people would never believe you could do it with such a big brush. So quick and so much fun. Okay. All righty, all righty. Maybe, maybe, maybe we'll go
right into a little bit of, I'll take a little sap
green, little crimson, just all these colors, and just maybe a small amount of yellow. And let's begin making
some little background things happening way back here. Just let them go. Very soft. This is just undercolor. (gentle, scratchy tapping) There. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Okay. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Now then. I want to add a small, small amount of paint thinner to my brush. Now, we've got burnt umber going here, Van Dyke brown, small
amount of yellow into it, and we just begin laying in all kinds of beautiful little shapes. And let things start getting darker, as they get closer to you. So, just let all these
beautiful little things happen. Let the color sort of work back and forth. (gentle, scratchy tapping) And wherever you want it to go. At this point, we really don't have to make any big decisions. Little bit later on
we're gonna have to make some decisions about where
all these land masses go. But not yet. Not yet. Don't even worry about it right now. Just drop in some background color. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Okay. Now then, I'm gonna go with
the same old dirty brush, I'm gonna go right in to some cad yellow, Indian yellow, little
yellow ochre, sap green, and I'm just mixing them
all right here on the brush. Just touch, tap, tap. Let's go back up to the canvas here. Now, I want to put a
little highlight on here. Just barely touching. Barely, barely, touching. Now, if your paint will not stick, add a little bit of paint thinner. Small, small amount. Small amount. But do don't that unless
your paint will not stick. Okay, maybe right in here. I'm gonna add a little more
green and yellow to that. I want it to be a little softer and stand out a little bit more. There. There we go. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Now, we're gonna have to start making some big decisions. What's happening in here? Well, let's mix up a very dark color. So, I'm gonna use thalo green, thalo green, and alizarin crimson. In about equal amounts. Now, these two colors mixed
together will make black. Very dark and very transparent. Beautiful color. Okay. Now, we'll go back, get
the old fan brush here, and I'm gonna go right
into that good dark color. Load a lot of paint in the brush. Lot of paint. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, there it is. Little tree lives right there. Little tree. Little tree. Sometimes it helps to
make the whole trunk, and that sort of gives you a guide. And you can go right in there, and decide where all your
little happy limbs are. And trees aren't always perfect. You know, limbs don't
grow equal on both sides, they don't grow to the same length, maybe it was a bad year,
maybe there wasn't much water, maybe there's too much water. Trees just, they grow
however makes them happy. And maybe one was happy here and grew. There he is. There he is. See how easy they are to make? All I'm doing is tapping with a fan brush. There we go. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, give him a friend. Don't want him to get lonely back here. Don't want him to be lonely. Now then, let's put some
little leaf indications. Once again, once again they
grow however makes them happy. So, they're not always perfect, and they're not always exactly even. (gentle, scratchy tapping) There. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Okay. (gentle, scratchy tapping) And this dark color
helps give your painting a little more interest. It really, really will make it look good. Okay, maybe, wherever you want a tree. Maybe, shoot, there's one right there. There it is. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Just as many trees as you want. This is your world so, just drop them in. Let them go, let them happen. Have fun. Have fun. ♫ Do-do-do-do-do-do-do ♫ Sometime I get carried
away and start singing, forget there's a microphone on. Hmm, all right. Now, go back into some yellow, green, and we can clean up
their little foots here. And the more you tap this,
the softer it'll become. So, maybe at home, when
you have unlimited time, you really want to take
some time and tap, tap till you make these just as soft. It'll almost look like velvet. So, add a little permanent
red to our color. Might as well have some fun back here. There. Let some little things happen. Maybe, maybe, maybe right there, there's some little bushes
and stuff that grow. Just touching. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Wherever you want them. Little bush here and there. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Oh, there's a pretty one. Little bit of permanent red in that one, makes him sparkle. Maybe, maybe, maybe right over here. Just put some little
things in the background. Break it up a little so
it's not a straight line. Pick up a little of that dark, it's 'cause there's a
shadow under these trees. They just don't stand out here. There's a shadow there. (gentle, scratchy tapping) See, now I've got dark in one corner, and highlight on the other,
so I can put a shadow in and then blend it right into the painting. Okay, let's take a clean fan brush. I'm gonna put a little bit
of, little bit of white on it, and right up in here, maybe, maybe, maybe there's a little path that goes
right on around the corner. We don't know where it goes. We don't know where it goes. Wherever it wants to go. Now, see, you're picking up
a lot of this grass color, and pulling it right into that. See, and it all blends together. Makes beautiful, beautiful
little things happen. Let them go. Don't fight with it. Let the canvas work. This is where it happens. You're depending on it
picking up this color. Don't fight with it. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) Let it happen, let it happen. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) Hmm, see how easy that is? Now, we can begin playing
here a little more with all these little grassy effects. (gentle, scratchy tapping) If you want one to stand out,
make it a little bit brighter, and then it'll pop right out there. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Just all kinds of beautiful
little things happening. (gentle, scratchy tapping) There we go. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Okay. (gentle, scratchy tapping) See, told you it was easy. (gentle, scratchy tapping) You know, we get so many
letters from people that are, they're painting along with us. And they said, Bob, you
were telling us the truth. It does work. And it'll work for you. If you haven't tried it, give it a try. You'll find that it's fantastic and you can do paintings that you never, never believed possible. And you can do them. There we go. Put a little highlight right over here. Little bit, little bit. Maybe another little bump. So you can divide these up
as many times as you want. And don't worry about this. Anything you don't want, you just take your fan brush and blend it right into the ground area. (gentle, scratchy tapping) This is your world and you
can do anything in your world. Anything. Anything. Look it there. See, you can let a little
of that play up in there, so it's not all just perfectly straight. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) There. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) Hmm. As many years as I painted,
I still get excited when I see these things happen. It's so fantastic. (gentle, scratchy swooshing) Okay. Tell you what. Maybe, maybe we'll just use the fan brush. Maybe there's a bush
that lives right here. We need some dark underneath. I'm just using the black
that's on the fan brush. You could use a brown,
whatever color you want. All you need is a dark color though, so the light will show. And we'll put a happy
little bush right there. Then, then, then let's
lay some highlights on it. And I'll just use the
corner of the large brush. It works fine. It works fine. Covered up our little red bush back there that we like so much. (gentle, scratchy tapping) Let's go into a little yellow ochre, change the color a little. Just play back and forth between the ochre and the cad yellow and the Indian yellow. And just let all these
little things happen. And you don't worry about it. Don't try to plan them. Don't try to plan them. Let them go. Okay, okay, let's have some fun. Maybe, maybe there's a few
great big trees in here. Let's go right into some Van Dyke brown. It's a beautiful,
beautiful chocolate brown. Maybe, got to make some decisions. There. There he is. We knew he was there. All I'm gonna do is just tap. Just tap with a fan brush. Put in some dark. Right down like that. There we go. Now, I have several fan brushes going. So, I'm gonna get another one here, and put some white on it
and a little burnt umber. White and burnt umber. There we go. Just load a lot of paint into the brush. Let's go up to the canvas. And we want a light side on this tree. So, we'll just come right down this side. See there? Come right on down. Right on down. And you can make him as big
or as small as you want. It's your tree. Okay, just sort of let
it play around in there. And then I'm gonna go back into my brown, and let the brown play around. So, they just sort of come together. (gentle, scratchy tapping) There we go. Can't tell where one color
starts and the other one stops. And it makes your tree look round. Now, we need some limbs
on that big old tree. So, let's go right into
some brown here maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
there's a nice big limb, and it comes right out through here. Now, you could use your
liner brush to do this if you wanted to. If you're using a liner
brush, you might need to put a little paint thinner
or a little thin oil with it, the paint, to make it
slide off that brush easy. There, give him a little arm. There we go. Maybe there's another one right there. Whatever. Make a decision, drop him in. There's one, there's one. And maybe some little
short ones here and there, wherever you want them. And it helps add some character. We want this to be a
strong, almighty tree. Let's give him a little foots down here. And then we'll tap. We'll pick up a little of that dark, and that'll help create
the illusion of his shadow. We need a shadow back here. Okay. That was so much fun. Let's go over to the other side. Let's go to the other side of the canvas. Maybe we'll just do another tree. Big, big, big tree. And maybe he only lives half
on the canvas and half off. And this is a huge tree. Big, big tree. (gentle, scratchy tapping) There we go. Just tap. I want the edges to be fuzzy. I don't want them to be sharp. 'Cause on evergreen trees,
you have all these little, little things that hang off the side, or at least where I live. And if you want them smooth, that's probably easier
than making them fuzzy. Just pull down and make a straight line. My home's right outside
of Fairbanks, Alaska, in a little town called North Pole. That's where Santa Claus lives. There we go. And back to our brown and white. And we can begin working some of that in. Just work it in. (gentle, scratchy tapping) So, even though we can't see it all, there's still light hitting this side, so don't leave that off. Make your tree look flat if you do that. And we want it to be round
and strong and very pretty. Okay? Now, let's give him a nice arm. He needs some arms, too. Maybe one comes right off here. I tell you what. I like to make limbs that, they
come right back around here, and drop right over the tree. So, there's some in the front, too. This is a big strong limb. Maybe there's all kind of
things hanging off of it. Oh, and these old trees sometime, they get all kind of little hangy-downs. Good word for it. When you don't know, you make up a word. Just make it up. Good word. I use it frequently when I'm
trying to explain evergreens, 'cause they have all
these little things that hang off of them, hangy-downs. Okay, now we can take our brush that has the light color on it, and let's put a little
highlight on this big limb. He needs some, too. So, he's an individual. Don't want him just to
be there by his self. There we go. Little highlight here and there. And it helps give him a little character. And let's go back to this first tree, this big one right here. These limbs need a little highlight, too. See, just touch, just touch. Think where light's gonna strike. Just like so. And maybe, maybe over here, maybe there's a, there, just
a little bit on that limb. There's a little right there. Little there. Right there. Just touch. These old fan brushes will do fantastic, fantastic things if
you give them a chance. I'll tell you what. Let's take our script liner brush, and go right into some of this brown. Turn the brush, turn it. That brings it to a nice, sharp point. (whistling) There. Okay, let's go up here. And maybe, maybe, maybe,
maybe, maybe, yup, maybe there's a little stick
that lives right out there. Just like so. And you're just putting
some little arms on. Let the brush bounce around
and play and have fun. Just let it go. Let it go. And you can make all kinds of
little things like this, see? They exist. They're always out there,
little limbs and sticks, and it makes your painting
a little more interesting. You go in, and if you're
out here selling paintings, if they look a little more interesting, then you're gonna look a
little more interesting when you go to bank. There. Just a few little twigs and sticks. Let these things just happen. Thin paint will stick to a thick paint. So, here I'm using a very thin paint. Almost like water. I've got a lot of paint thinner. And you can just make all kinds of beautiful, little things happen. All righty. All righty. And there comes a time
when a painting's finished, and you are to stop piddling with it. And that's about where I'm at right now. So, I think I'll clean
up my little liner brush. We use some thin oil, and go right into my permanent red. Turn that brush once again. Bring it to a nice, sharp point, and see how thin the paint is. It's almost like a liquid. It's almost like a liquid. Okay, let's go right up here, and let's sign this one right here, and we'll call it finished. And I really hope you enjoyed this one. This is a beautiful painting. Do nice things to your heart, and bring some joy into your life. So, from all of us here, we'd like to wish you happy painting. God bless. We'll see you next week. (bright instrumental music)
