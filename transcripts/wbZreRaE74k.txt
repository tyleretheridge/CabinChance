- Hello, I'm glad to see you today. Today I think we'll do a
fantastic little painting that I think it'll make you happy. And before we start I'm gonna have 'em graphically run all the
colors across the screen that you need to complete this painting. And while they're doin' that let's go up here and get started. I've already covered the
canvas with a thin, even coat of magic white, so it's
wet, slick, and ready to go. And today let's start, we'll use a big ol' two and a half inch brush. And then we'll go right
into a little bit of the phthalo blue. Pull a little bit of it
out, and really work it into the bristles. Tap, just tap that brush right in there. That'll get you a nice,
even distribution of color. And if you just reach
up in there and pull out a big gob of paint and hit the canvas, you're gonna have huge,
big streaks up there that'll drive you crazy. And we'll just make some
little crisscross strokes just like so. Just have fun. Let the brush play around on the canvas. And I don't wanna cover the entire sky. All I wanna do is just here and there leave some spots open. There. Maybe today we'll do a
beautiful little mountain. I love to paint mountains. When you live in Alaska,
you have a tendency to paint a lot of mountains. And no matter if you live
in Florida, or Alaska, it seems that mountains are always paintings that people like. And if you're interested
in making a happy buck, they're the ones that'll sell. Okay, and that quick, we
got a basic little sky. And without cleaning
the brush, I'm gonna go right into a small amount
of alizarin crimson. And just work it right into
the bristles the same way. Very, very small amount. And I'll go back into these light areas, and very lightly just
drop in a little color. Just make the sky a little warmer little prettier. There we go. Okay, and I think we'll have
some water in this painting. So I'll go right back into a
little bit of the phthalo blue and a little bit of the crimson. And we'll just mix these on the brush. And just a small amount of crimson. Okay, now to make water, we're gonna pull from the outside in. And if it's still water,
it's always level. It's always flat. There, pull from the outside in. And if you leave a little place open right up through here, it'll look like a sheen of light coming across the water
when you're finished. And people think you worked and worked and worked to put that in. And all you do is let
the canvas show through. You've already got magic white on it. So it's painted. It's ready. Very lightly, go all the way across. That light area still remain there. And we can very quickly
just blend the sky. And you can blend this to
any degree that you want. Any degree that you want. In fact, you can blend it
'til it just goes away, and it just becomes one color. Leave some color and you'll
let some things happen. Okay, let's wash the ol' brush. And we wash our brushes
with odorless paint thinner. And there's a screen in
the bottom of my can. There we go. There we are. That screen sets about that high off the bottom of the can. So when you scrub the brush all the solid material
settles to the bottom, and it keeps your paint
thinner relatively clean. All right. Let's build a happy little mountain. And maybe today we'll start. Let's go in to some Van Dyke brown. Van Dyke brown, a little
bit of pthalo blue. And we'll throw a small
amount of crimson in there. So we got blue, brown,
small amount of crimson. Pull the paint out very
flat, cut across it, and get a small roll of paint right out on the edge of the knife. There we go, you can
see it very well there. Let's go right up here. You have to make a decision. Where's your mountain live? Where's your mountain live? Maybe there it is. There it is. It lives right there. And just put in happy
little basic shape here for our mountain. Very dark color. Very very dark. One thing about mountains,
and I've said it before. But I'll repeat it, but
it's worth repeating. If you can see the entire mountain, it's always more distinct at the top than it is at the bottom. So fill in the top of the mountain. Then we'll take a large brush, and I'm just gonna very gently pick up some of that top and bring it down. It mixes with the magic white, and automatically, automatically, it's lighter at the bottom
than it is at the top. Let the canvas work. Let the paint, and the magic
white, and the brushes work. It's what makes this fun. Okay now, clean this brush. Actually I just like to beat that brush. Okay, let us go right in to. Let's take some and pull
out some yellow ochre. Little bit of burnt umber with it. Yellow ochre, little bit of burnt umber. And let's begin making some. I'm gonna put some little highlights here. I'm gonna put a little
more burnt umber into that. Dull it down a little bit more. There. Good. Cut across it so you have
that small roll of paint again right out on the edge. Okay let's go up here. Now very lightly figure out
where your light's coming from. If you're right handed, it's
probably easier to have it coming from the right. If you're left-handed it'll vary. Okay just drop in a little highlight just where you think the light
would strike this mountain. Just let it play and bounce and have fun. Wherever you want it. Wherever. Now I'm gonna take a little
bit of Van Dyke brown and some white, and a
little bit of the blue and just mix it together. I'm looking for a shadow color. Something about like so. Maybe a little bit more blue. This is your mountain. So you make it whatever color you want. Same thing. Cut across. Little roll of paint. Let's go right up here. Then we can begin looking for shadows. Just very lightly, very lightly. Barely touching the canvas. Just caress the canvas. Barely, barely touch it. Then we can come back
with the highlight color and just sort of playin' back and forth. Let all these little things just happen. Just let 'em fall off your knife. Let 'em have fun. There's a little light striking. There it is, right there. Right there, right there. Maybe there's a little right there. Wherever you want light to strike, that's where it oughtta be. Maybe it this comes down. It sorta goes together. And mountains are so much fun. Mountains are so much fun. They'll just let ya go crazy with your imagination. Maybe, tell you what, maybe, maybe take a little titanium
white with the least little amount of phthalo blue in it, and maybe, maybe let's go right here. There's a little bit of
snow layin' up in here. And I put the blue in it just to give it a little shadow color. Barely touching. Maybe there's a little lives right here. Just lay it in wherever
you think it should be. Maybe a little right in there. Then you go back and then you can clean all this up. Bring it all together. And this is a way you lay snow in there. And you don't want too much. You wanna keep this
mountain strong and dark. Take a little bit of
the Van Dyke brown here. Just put some deep shadows in. Van Dyke brown. There. Wherever you want it. Just let it bounce around,
and play, and have fun. And it's a super, super
little way to make a very effective mountain. It's easy to do. Lot of fun. I think you'll enjoy it. Put a few little things here
and there just to break it up. Maybe there's some little grassy areas that run up the side here. So I'll go right into
the same mountain color. Add a little bit more crimson to it. So I'll just tap a little
bit on to the brush. There we go. Just tap it. Okay let's go back up here. And maybe, maybe, maybe, there. Put some little grassy
areas that'll come in right up the side of this mountain. And we put some dark color in first so we can put a lighter
color on top of it. Just there. Just let it pick up all
these little colors. Follow the basic angles
that are in your mountains. There we go. Over here, maybe it comes right down. There we go. Now without cleaning the brush I'm gonna go right into a
little bit of cad yellow, a little Indian yellow. Just mix these on the brush. And let's begin just lifting up some of these little colors. Just touch it, lift up. Look like a little happy
sunlight playin' through there. And you have to decide how far up the mountain this goes. I'm gonna start adding a small amount of sap green here and there. I'm beginning to see some green. There. And you can just play back and forth between the greens, and the yellows, and make all kinds of happy
little sun things happen. See how easy that is? And it's fun. It makes you happy. It makes you happy. And that quickly, we have a basic little mountain. There. And you can really, really
put some detail in these. They're a lot of fun to do. Do several ranges of 'em. Big, strong, almighty
mountains livin' up here. Okay. That'll give us somethin'
to play with there. Now I'm gonna take my large brush, and I wanna soften this. So I'm just gonna tap the edges. Right on the edges. And just mix 'em with the magic white and automatically it
gets lighter in value. Automatically. You don't have to worry about it. The canvas and the paint does it. There we go. See how soft you can make that? Gently lift up. You can make that just soft and tender. All right, all right, all right. Now we're ready. Now we can start playing. We got a happy little mountain back there. We're ready to go. Clean the ol' brush off again. All right. Tell you what. Let's mix up. We got some mountain color here. That was Van Dyke brown, phthalo blue, alizarin crimson, and
I'm gonna add to that a little bit of sap green, just a small amount. Just a small amount. Let me just mix us up some color, and then I'll get the fan brush. Okay, and I'm gonna load this fan brush full of paint. Put a lot of paint in the bristles. Just pull it through there. Wiggle it sometimes. That helps a great deal. And it sharpens your brush. But you can see all the paint that's in that brush. Lot of paint. Okay let's go up to the canvas here. Maybe there's a beautiful little hill that lives right there. You knew he was there. And all I'm doing here is just touching the canvas and tapping downward. Let all these little things just fall right out of your fan brush. And it makes an indication
of distant trees without actually doin' a lot of work. And I'm lazy. I look for easy ways to paint. To me, painting should always be fun. If it's not fun, then you
have to change something to make it fun. Have to make it fun. Okay and we'll just let these come. There we go. Trees grow to all sizes, and all shapes. Vary your little foothill. Makes it more interesting. Put little bumps on it and trees. All different shapes. Now but you don't wanna
kill all this misty area. This misty area right in here between the dark and the mountain. This little misty area is
all that separates these. So treasure it. It's very, very important. Hang on to it. Hang on to it. Keep it. Wherever you want this to go. Wherever. Okay we need to add some trees over here. Maybe this goes right down just like so. And we can just drop in some color while we've got it on the brush See this is what makes it so much fun. You really don't have to worry about it. You don't have to plan it all. Just sorta let it happen. Now with the big brush, I'm gonna create some more mist. So I'm just gonna take and tap the bottom. Just tap it. That creates beautiful little misty areas. There we go. And that simple, you
have a nice misty area. And you need these misty areas to separate different planes. There we go. Just lift it up a little. And we don't care if we get
some of these down in the water. Shoot they just come right out. No big deal. Easy. Can fix easy. Now with the same old brush I'm gonna go right in to a little
bit of the cad yellow. And since it has green and blue on it, that's gonna make a nice green color. Maybe I'll add a little
more sap green to it. I want quite a dark green here. Okay, I'm gonna put a
little bit of highlight just here and there. Just enough to make this a
little more interesting is all. Just touching and pulling down. Don't wanna kill all this. Just here and there. Add a little Indian yellow here and there. Maybe a little touch of yellow ochre. Don't overdo. Don't overdo. Wanna keep this quite dark, and we don't want a lot of detail. It's too far away. There we go. Maybe there's a little, little light shining right across there. Wherever you want it, there we go. Now with our large brush, same old brush, I'm just gonna tap that again to create a nice misty effect. There. Then lightly, lightly lift upward. Then we can just blend this out. See I told ya it'd go away. Told ya it'd go away. Okay. I'm gonna grab another fan brush. I have several fan brushes going so I don't have to clean 'em. And go right back into this dark color. Add a little more of the green, and the brown, and the blue. Good dark color. Crimson. Should look black on your palette. Maybe maybe maybe maybe, yep. There's a happy little evergreen lives right there. We drop a center on it. And then very lightly
just come right down. Now, the happy little tree. That easy. There he goes. There we go. Just work that brush back and forth. Let's give 'im a friend. He's got a friend that lives right there. Just back and forth. And remember trees,
they don't grow perfect. Trees are like, well they're like us. They have flaws and imperfections. Of course you don't, but I
have several imperfections. There we go, okay, one right there. Just let these trees come
right off your brush. And however many you want. This is your area, so
however many trees you want, drop 'em in. Maybe there's a little
land mass that comes right out there. Right out like that. Wherever you want it, drop it in. And we need some reflections, so we just do them. All we're looking for is
just very basic shapes here. Where there's a tall tree here, you want a reflection
that's roughly the same. There's even a taller
one, so you can just, just have fun. Have fun. There we go. Another little tree. And probably one of the
most fantastic things that happens with this technique is reflections. Watch how easy this is. Now we'll touch, and just pull down. And it mixes with the magic white. And you can move this paint. This was a dry canvas, uh huh, you'd be in agony city right now. But since it's wet, this paint will move. Now very lightly just go across. And that quick you have
instant reflections. And you can push the paint on here. Maybe let's go right in here. Maybe you can take and push it a little. See how you can push that? You can wiggle these reflections. Make 'em move. Now if that was a dry canvas, once again, you couldn't do that. All right. I'm gonna take a little
bit of yellow ochre, and put a small amount of white with it. Just yellow ochre and white. And get a very small roll of paint. Let's go up here. And we'll just use yellow ochre today for trunks. You could use brown. I'm just, I'm in a mood to use a little ochre. There. See I was born and raised in the south, and I have a tendency to say okra, which is a plant, a very
nice food I used to eat. And so almost a natural
tendency to say okra rather than ochre. Now a little, this is a little
sap green and cad yellow on the fan brush, and we can very quickly, if I just drop in a few little
highlights on these trees. Don't kill all your dark. That dark is so important. So, so important. There. Okay, a little bit on this tree. And while we got this ol' brush runnin', I'll add a little bit of the yellow ochre. And a little bit. And just very quickly just drop in some little grassy areas here and there. This is sap green, cad
yellow, yellow ochre. And it's just all mixed on the brush. Just let it go. There we are. Now then. I'm gonna take another fan brush, and put some Van Dyke brown on it, and some burnt umber. Just mix 'em on the brush. And, and, and, and I'm just gonna scrub in some some little ground areas here. Just very simple. Drop 'em in. There we go. Wherever you want 'em. Okay. Now I'm gonna go into some titanium white and yellow ochre. Like that color today. Titanium white and yellow ochre. And let's go right up here and very lightly, just barely, barely touching the canvas, put a little highlight on your dirt. Don't want too much. Just a little. Okay, right there. There we go. Let it go. And a little bit wherever. Wherever you think it
is, that's where it is. Just let that drop right off your brush. And that's a super, super easy way to make some very effective land areas. Now take a little bit of the color and just bring it right
down into the land. And that way it brings it all together. Makes it look like it fits. And a little bit of the
magic white on the knife. And let's go up in here and put in some happy little water lines. There we go. And I'm just literally
cutting into the canvas. Just like you're trying
to cut a hole in it. This old canvas is tough. You're not gonna hurt it. Not gonna hurt it. There we go. And a little bit right there. And we have one side finished that easy. Okay and let's go over
to the other side now. Get some brown and green and blue. Lot of paint on the brush. Maybe there's an almighty
tree that lives over here. Maybe he lives, yep, right there. Right there. And just let this brush
play back and forth. And there he comes. We knew he was in there. There. See how easy that is? You can just push that tree right out of your brush. And we'll give him a, we'll give him a little friend there. Right on out. Maybe another one here. However many trees you want. This is your world, so whatever you want. There we go. And while I got this
old dirty brush going, we'll just drop something right in here. And we need, we need, we need, just like on the other side, let's put a few reflections right in here. And all we're doing is
layin' color in right now. We could care less
what's happening with it. We'll work on all that later. Right now just lay some color out. And back to our large brush. And let's make some beautiful little reflections right here. Pull down. Straight down. Go across. Okay and back to our
yellow ochre and white. Maybe I'll put a tiniest little
bit of burnt umber into it. Just to darken it down a
little bit for this side. And we'll drop a few little
trunks here and there. Just like so. A little bit of highlight color with the green and the yellow. See there? See there, just put some
leaves on that rascal. Tree, tree needs more leaves so he shines. Want 'im to sparkle in the sun. There. And maybe, maybe, maybe, where'd my fan brush go? There it is. Get some Van Dyke brown,
a little burnt umber. Maybe there's a nice big stone that lives right here. See how easy? And just drop in a big stone. Maybe he's got a friend
that lives over here. Back to my yellow ochre. And if you ever have
trouble making paint stick, add a small amount of paint thinner. Thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Put a little highlight up here. Gonna add a least little
touch of permanent red to that too, yellow ochre
and a little permanent red. And don't overmix your color. Don't overmix it. Little bit right in there. Okay, and we'll go back to our fan brush that had the green and yellow on it. And we'll put some happy
little bushes and stuff, right, right there it is. Just let it play down all around the little
stones and the rocks. Vary your colors a little. Make 'em sparkle. Let that tree come right on down. There we are. You can see how easy it is to make a very effective,
very pretty little painting. Come back in to my magic white. Put some more water lines here. Just like so. There we are. Now maybe, maybe, there we go. Little water line comes right
comes right around the stone. But let it come around the stone. Don't just cut the bottom off straight. The stone won't be near as interesting. We want nice and interesting
happy little stones here. Just like so, and I think we've about got a finished painting. So I'm gonna take a little bit of thin oil and this could be linseed oil or poplar. Whatever, it doesn't matter. Let's go right up in here and sign this one. Little permanent red. And when you're signing yours at home, sign it in any color that you want. I just like red. There we are. I think we have a finished painting. And from all of us here, happy painting. God bless. (relaxing music)
