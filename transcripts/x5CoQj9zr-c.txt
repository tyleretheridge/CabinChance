hey I'm really really glad you could join me today today is a very special day to me and I'd like to share that special day with you today marks a sort of an anniversary for us where this painting we will have one hundred joy of painting shows isn't it fantastic it's it's almost unbelievable to me then we have a hundred shows now and I owe it to you because you've allowed me into your home each week you've called your PBS station you've wrote letters you've made it possible and I'd like to tell you thank you and I hope you enjoy this painting so let's go on up and let's get started let's say today we'll have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to do the painting starting with the white and working around and that'll tell you everything that you need to paint this beautiful painting let's talk a little bit as I have done on one of the earlier shows I've taken and covered the canvas with contact paper this is just ordinary contact paper you can buy at your local hardware store or supermarket whatever and I've just cut a design out here now in all honesty this design came from a placemat off my table so anything you can find to make a nice-looking design you can use it and then I've covered the outside of the canvas with a contact paper and we're ready to go and on that we'll do a pretty little painting so let's get started I'm going to take off with a small amount a cadmium yellow just the least little touch least little touch will do a bright shiny pictures go right in here and I'll just go across just like it yes like so without cleaning the brush I'm going right into a little bit of yellow ochre same old dirty brush and just lay a little touch so it blends right into that like here once again without cleaning the brush I'm going into a little bit of the bright-red little bit it's very very strong and not just put a little layer red right across there okay it's sort of just very gently very gently blend all those together you don't want to look like stripes just flame it together all righty now then then I'm going to take a fan brush and go right into a little touch of the midnight black just a little bit just go up here and up in here I'm going to bounce in some happy little happy little cloud shapes just let that brush plating just work right down into the red keep the brush moving little circles little tiny circles just let it go every which way here and there okay you know wash that little brush just a little bit of paint thinner and very gently just gonna blend that black right here on the bottom sort of blend it all together now then under the black I'm gonna go into the dark Sienna same old fan brush okay let's go back up here and just put in a little bit of this beautiful beautiful brown color and let it play around I can't just sort of warms up the sky and I have several fan brushes going so I don't have to spend a lot of time washing brushes so I'll take some red and titanium white just to make a nice pink color with that let's go right up here and we just bounce in some happy little cloud shapes just little tiny tiny circles ke from going keep them going and I did pick up some of that under color so it all mixes together there some of the Browns and a little bit of a black now with a clean dry brush very gently very gently just blend all this together you don't want to kill all the little clouds now these dark colors underneath here well absolutely eat up your light colors so be very careful don't want to eat them all up you can make a fantastic little sky that easy very gentle hero3 hairs and some air and you can beat the brush in that that removes the excess paint you don't have to go through all the cleaning procedures look at there now just gently blend it and you have an all-night esky all righty we got us a little sky let me wash this brush as you know we wash the brushes with odorless tanner shake them off and just beat the devil out of them alright let's get the old round brush I'm go right into some Van Dyck Brown some of the dark Sienna maybe a touch of the SAP green in there too just a little bit let's drop in some some happy little tree shapes and we're gonna put in some little background trees just tapping just happy you know as I said at the beginning of the show this is a very very special show to me because it marks 100 joy at painting shows me as far as we know as of the filming of this show that's gosh I said most painting shows any series has ever had that's unreal and there's been a lot of fantastic people that have helped to make all of this possible a lot of fantastic people and I would like to I'd like to dedicate this painting to a couple of people that have really made the joy of painting possible there's been several but I'd really like to to mention by name first of all uh my wife Jane she's stood behind listen and kept his thing going and takes a special lady to live with a crazy man and two other people that have really really been super my business partners and closest friends Walt Pinet Kowalski without them there would have been no joy of painting and would like to publicly say thank you very much let's take a little brown here this is the dark sienna Van Dyke and let's begin putting in some happy little things right along here this is where we begin creating little lay of the land back in there see how easy that is hey hey be right over here all this dark is is just just to give us a base color so the light will show we put it on top there we go all right all right I'm gonna take the liner brush a little bit of paint thinner on it make that paint a stain is water turn that brush pull it ends and let's put some let's put a few indications of some little tree trunks we back we back in the distance there's one before he just came right up above the trees see there kitty and you can put as many or as few as you want in your painting there we go start all over yeah let's start putting some highlights on there I'll just go back into this little round brush same old dirty brush I haven't cleaned it will tap in some yellows I'll grab a little green SAP green and we just tap it in I got some yellow ochre CAD yellow little Indian yellow okay let's go up here just using the very top corner of the brush just put in some happy little shapes don't kill all your dark areas don't kill them all look at that see if you put too much detail then it's gonna look too close and we want this to look like it's far far away and very quiet soft there I had a little bit of the bright red to that Keller oh look at there there's a nice one nice one okay right there Oh cans of things and work in layers layer after layer after layer that's what agreed to depth in your painting okay now we can come down here put in a little more of the dark and we can start putting into highlights as I say this is where you really begin figuring out the lay of the lamp so let's begin dropping it like so okay once we have this dark here either then we're ready so same whole dirty brush I'm gonna go right into some of the yellows and tap it see just tap it okay let's go right up here now then just begin touching very gentle like so and you can make layer after layer after layer what you're doing this if you had trouble getting your paint a stick add a little bit of the liquid white or a small amount of paint thinner just to make your pain a little dinner I added a touch of the bright red there just get it to stand out a little see you can just make layer after layer nice and right there we go anywhere you want to he'll just put a little bright area and it creates the illusion of a a happy little hillock there well just I don't know go in there and let it work right on up and just let your imagination go when you're doing these at home the open here we'll just pull that across we'll come back and play with that later watch you now we'll take a fan brush and very gently with a fan brush let's make the indication of just just a happy little path that lives right up here all you're doing is grabbing a little bit that color I'm just pulling it if you want to you here and there you can add a little bit of brown just to make it look more like dirt but allow it to grab these colors just glitter I don't know you got a little path that easy my head with a touch of titanium point there just to make it look like there's a little Sun playing through there just a little sunshine okay we can take the knife and just scratch into indication of a few little trunks back in these distant trees the background trees just hearing there now then let's me find my fan brush we'll go into some brown and some of the midnight black let's build a little tree let's have some fun a lot of paint on the brush let's go right up here maybe their lives right here right here just a happy little evergreen tree all I'm doing is just just barely touching the canvas and I take the corner of the brush and give it a little upward push see give it a little huh we'll put some little blooms out here on him just like so make his trunk nice and strong give him a little foots he's got to have something to stand on something to stand on okay maybe he's got a friend that lives yep right there right there his friends a little bigger a little stronger maybe he's got two friends just like yeah now then on these they're a little closer so you'd see a little more detail I'm gonna take a little white on another fan brush and just very gently very gently come along this edge and put a little bit of highlight just to make them stand out a little better and you can take your script liner brush a little bit of the liquid black and put a little film here and there see there just a couple happy little limbs in fact earth two inch brush and just sort of blend his little foots right into the right into the little grassy areas that easy factor black brown mixture let's go up here maybe yeah there we are it's a happy little leaf little limbs little leaves on these trees just live right about there I can't and then same will brush I'll go right into a little bit of yellow cuz there's black on there when you hit that yellow it's gonna turn a beautiful green color loaded full let's go back up here now you can come back and just put some highlights to want to cover all the dark maybe I'll make it a little bit brighter so you can see it a little more that yep there it shows up a little better for you see they're nice leaves there and maybe there's even a few shining on this one back here he's father well you're not gonna see as much detail on that one alright I think we're I think we're coming right along here Brad now then let's have some fun let's bring the camera right up close here this is where the fun starts they grab this contact paper take this off look at that look at that isn't that fantastic see it already you have all you nice borders and around here and what's really fun when you're doing this at home you might want to paint this oh like a nice tan color or a very light like chalk powder blue you can do all kinds of things so it looks like borders looks like it's matted around there when you get all finished I get I get excited about these there are a lot of fun okay go right into some alizarin crimson a little bit of the phthalo blue proportionately much more crimson and the blue much more crimson just tap that big brush in round brush now here we go this is what's fun to me I like to come out of these borders that we created and let the painting actually extend right out of the borders and all we're doing here is just tapping in some very basic little shapes where you want some happy little things to be just like so see and we're totally killing this border okay now then I'll just use the same will brush we'll go right into some Van Dyck Brown dark sienna and we'll put another little tree there's right here just all kinds of little trees see how those little things happen maybe there's a heavy bush it goes right here these are really fun paintings I hope you try some of them they're so so effective that comes right on down wherever you want it to go wherever over here not much color that it like a vignette just let it get softer and softer and softer over here toward the edges there we go all right now then we'll take a liner brush let's put some paint thinner on it and go right into our Brown turn that brush bring it to a nice sure point okay now then let's go right up in here and here some nice tree limbs let's set them true right out onto the pure white canvas see there look at him just here and there just here wherever there is something we over there look at there you can just make all kinds of happy little eels this is just brown with paint thinner so it flows there we go but you have to make big decisions here how many limbs live in your painting just however many you want that's all okay I may be down here just to change things a little bit maybe maybe this tree has a white trunk so I'll just use a little bit of the liquid white and we'll put a little white trunk in there is that easy I like to turn that brush it picks up all those under colors and makes beautiful little effects say there see how that stands out though if you put dark against dark you wouldn't have a whole bunch but when you put this light against the dark oh they stand out and shine for you there maybe there's a little one right here however many you want that's up to you now we can have some fun let's take the old two-inch brush and we'll go right into some color here this is yellow and green and I'm just tapping it like so okay let's go up here now then right along in here just barely touching the canvas just put in a happy little leaf here there and let some of them extend out over your dark under color that helps create the illusion of a of a vignette see there no these paintings really excite me this is this is reason I chose to do this type of painting on such a special day I'm really glad you joined me for this status as I say Dee you just can't believe how special this is for me and you've made it possible there there we go now let's put some let's put some things in here I'll go back to the round brush it's a lot of fun I'm just tapping into a little yellow ochre and little green reach over here get a touch of the bright red just a touch it's very strong very strong just go up here now then just using the top corner just the very top God just tap in all kinds a little leafy effects after paint won't stick I've set it over and over add a little bit of liquid white or a little bit of thinner let him just come right on because a thin paint will stick to a thick paint then the thick it's probably our golden rule signal illest project right on out past the dark there's another happy little Bush that's right there see I knew he was there you did too didn't he you knew he was there there we go there's another little Bush he lives right there okay coming right on forward oh there's one he's looks like he's got little flowers on him happy blush it's only kind of bushes we make they're always happy and we'll just sort of let some little things just just graduate out into here just let the color just sort of disappear gentle gentle light little touch see there these are very soft little paintings these make excellent gifts for all your friends people really love these and when you frame them oh you can't believe how pretty they are can't believe and your friends will say you didn't paint that but you know you did and you can you can do it take just that Klein point of knife and scrape down a few little sticks and trunk indications here and there just like so oh right you know me I'm not happy when we paint unless we have a big tree in there so let's put a big tree I don't go right into the midnight black and the Van Dyck Brown lololololololololol just be happy mix up all these colors look at all the paint nut brush let's go up here I said I wanted a big tree so let's do a penguin I think my big tree lives don't yell at me don't yell at me he lives right there there he comes oh goodness big ol tree he goes right off the canvas strong tree big tree look at that be brave hey right maybe he's got a big foot it comes right down here I can't make old foot all right now I've got another fan brush and I used dirt it's got white on it so we'll just take it it will come right down the side here come right down the outside edge first see and tap this tap this makes a tree bark looks sort of fuzzy and that to me is the way the way old evergreen trees look they got a sort of textured bark ruff maybe right in here see how you can divide that tree up and create a little hollow in there shoot ESCO that's where some little creature lives right in there he needs a little house yeah then liner brush right into some of the liquid black and let's take and put the limb right there right there sinking put as many limbs as you want in yours we just put a few in just to show you how this is just straight liquid black same there we go and have some in there that are broken off evergreens especially why they they have a lot of oil to get broke off yeah this is where all the little squirrels come and set the plane they have to have a good time too now while we had this liquid black going here let's just work on look at there we'll just have it big oh root just come right on down just sort of hangs right on off the canvas look at that and there's one right there and maybe maybe there's one it comes over the other way just use your imagination here let's sudden these little things just sort of happen okay we can go right into a touch of the liquid white got a little highlight right out here just like you just might care isn't that something that's something I like these little paintings and I really hope you do and I'm glad that you've been with me today to share this special day thank you very much for being with me today I like for all my friends to to enjoy special days with me and I have so many beautiful friends all over the country that the painting shows have allowed me to meet alright let's go back to her brush it has the black in it this is just midnight black let's go right up in here and let's put in there they are she's beautiful little leaves on this big evergreen tree wherever you think they should live scene I like this here because it breaks the border there but leaves it there so you can see it that's one of them happy accidents we're always talking about learn to use them learn to make friends with that it'll be enough to show home I want to show hey there right there okay now then take another fan brush we'll use yellow and SAP green yellow SAP green little lot of color on the brush okay let's go right back up here now then come right along in here and
