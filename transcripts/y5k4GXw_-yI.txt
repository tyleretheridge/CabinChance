(soothing, gentle music) - Hello, I'm glad you could join me today. And today, we're gonna
do something fantastic that I think you'll really love. We're gonna use a black canvas, and I'm gonna do an almighty seascape here and show you how to do
some fantastic things. First of all, we'll have
them run all the colors that we're gonna use across your screen so you can see exactly
how my palette's laid out. And while they're doing
that, let me explain what I've already done on the canvas here. We have a black canvas. This is painted with a flat, black acrylic and allowed to dry. Now, on the bottom, I've
started out with burnt umber, and I've put a little strip of burnt umber across the bottom. Then, I've blended that
right into Van Dyke brown, right into thalo green and a
little thalo blue around it, and the whole top of the canvas
is done in Prussian blue. So it's very strong, very,
very dark dark blue color. And it should still look black. That's a good way to tell
if a color's transparent. When you put it on a black canvas, it should still look black. So now that we've got the color on there, let's start off, and let's do
a fantastic painting together. I'm gonna use the old fan brush today, and we'll run into a little
bit of titanium white. Now, when you're doing a black canvas, you'll find that color
shows up much, much stronger than it does on a white canvas. So okay, got the fan brush loaded up. Let's go up to the canvas, and maybe there's a happy little
cloud that is right there, right there, and use
the corner of the brush. Tight, tight little circles. Just let it play and have fun. Okay, darker, darker, darker, just want the edges to be bright. A little bit more paint, and
maybe, maybe, maybe there's a, oh, there it is, a beautiful cloud that just sort of floats
around right there. And it comes right across. There it is. (brush rustles) Just let it wander around and have fun. Clouds are free, one of the
freest things in nature. There we go. Okay, now, let's take, let's
take the old 2 1/2 inch brush, and using just the
corner, I'm very lightly gonna blend the bottom of this cloud out, not touching the top,
just blending the bottom. And then, lift it up, and gently, gently blend it very lightly. Same thing, do it again. (brush rustles) We'll do it again. Okay, I'll do this one (members). Just blend it out. (brush rustles) And there we go, but you see how a little bit of color shows
up on this black canvas. It really stands out. It's a beautiful, beautiful medium, and you can do all kinds
of fantastic things. It's not limited to
seascapes or landscapes. It makes beautiful, beautiful still lifes, beautiful floral paintings. It really, really works. We've taught some people
who make their entire living now doing nothing but black canvases. It is certainly, certainly
a happy (murmurs). All right, there we go. Add a little cloud,
and this is your world, so however many clouds you want, that's how many you are to have. So let them float around
in the sky and have fun. There. (brush rustles) Okay now, once again,
take the 2 1/2 inch brush, and very gently, blend the bottom out. Just blend the bottom out, and you need some of these nice, dark areas in here. They end up being the shadows. Don't want to kill all
of those with color. Leave them in. Leave them in. Let things happen. Let the canvas work. Let the brush work. That's when the prettiest things happen, when you're not expecting it. See, and then lift it up. Lift it up, and then gently brush it. And that easy, you have fantastic clouds. Okay, maybe, maybe, maybe
there's another little cloud. Just little, little floaters
that float right down in here. Just let them play. (brush rustles) Let them play there. Okay, and I will blend
these, and I think we'll be ready to take a look, see, and see what we have going here. When you do a painting, you
know, step back sometime and look at your painting. Step back, and it really helps, helps you see the painting better. Lift that up. (brush rustles) There. Okay, let me wash the
old fan brush off here. (water swishes) And we're in business. Now, wash the brush with
odorless paint thinner. Okay, better wash this big one,
too, before we get started. Let's start with all clean brushes. (brush taps on post) Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,
boop, that's a lot of fun. Okay, let's mix up a good black color, and for black, we'll use
alizarin crimson and thalo green. Alizarin crimson and thalo green. I know it sounds crazy,
but it comes out to make a beautiful, beautiful black color. True black, and it's also
very, very transparent. It works extremely well when
you need a transparent paint. Okay, mix it very good. Pick the paint up off the
palette and turn it over. That assures that you mix it evenly. And you really can't tell
what color you have there, so let me wipe the knife off, and we'll check their color,
and the only way to check it is to take a little bit of white and see if it's what you're looking for. And that's about what I'm looking for, a nice, good, true gray. And we know anytime we put white
or a light value with that, that's what we're gonna get. Okay, good. Now, let's take, let's use
the old fan brush today. Load a lot of paint into the bristles. Really get it filled up. There you go. Pull it through, both
sides, just like that. So you turn that brush and get both sides. All right, let's go up to the canvas here. Maybe there's a big stone out in the water here, huge big stone. It comes right down. And just use the corner of the fan brush. A big bump, uh, and just
let your hand wiggle and put all these beautiful
little shapes in here. Maybe this, there it goes
right off through there. And we'll just fill all this in. (brush rustles) The fan brush is a
fantastic, fantastic brush. It will do things that
you almost can't believe, but you gotta make friends with it. There we go. We'll just let that wander
right on off into the blue. (brush rustles) All right, now, maybe on this big stone, maybe it's so big,
maybe there's some trees that live out there. And let's go right up here,
and we touch the canvas, and we use just the corner of the brush. And we'll put a happy little tree. Lives right there. There he is. There he is. And maybe there's, maybe
there's several trees. However many you want. This is your big stone, so you can put as many trees on it or as few. Just little indications
here and there, wherever. Okay, now, nice little tree
that lives right there. There we go. Now, I have several fan brushes, so I don't have to clean them continually, but at home, if you only
have one brush, that's fine. You just have to clean it more than I do. Take a little bit of the Van
Dyke brown, a little white, and then, a little bit of this
black color or gray there. Load a lot of color into the brush. Okay, let's go back to the canvas here, and we'll put a little
bit of highlight here. So just go out. Let this just barely touch, and it'll make all these
beautiful little highlights. And let them just wander
right on out into nothing. (brush rustles) Okay, a little more paint on the brush. Maybe there's a little
highlight, uh, right there. Right there. And there. I see some on that. Wherever you want it to be. Now, back to our brush with black on it, and we touch, we pull down. Brushstrokes are very,
very important in this. Very important. Your brushstrokes form your rocks. See how easy it is, though,
to make some beautiful rocks down and out here, and that quick. We'll let that one come right on through, but you gotta make decisions,
which one's in front, which one's in back. There we go. Okay, maybe, maybe, that went so well. Maybe, there it is. Let's go right up here. There we go. Let's just lay another big
rock right along there, nice and dark in. And we need something to
separate these two rocks. So an easy way to create
a separation between them is to put some mist in there. Let's take a 2 1/2 inch brush, a little bit of white paint on it, and just very gently, very, very gently, tap in a little bit of mist. Very little paint. Once again, color shows
up so much stronger on this black canvas than
it does in a white canvas. A very, very little paint. I can't, can't tell you that enough. There we go. Now, lift it gently up,
following all these angles that you've put in your, into your rocks. Don't want to lose those. And that'll give us the illusion of a tiny little bit of mist,
just enough to separate. Okay, now, we'll go back to this, and why don't we bring this
one right on down right there? Fill all that in with a good, dark color, and since we're using a black here that's extremely transparent,
it really didn't matter if we get little bit into
what's gonna be water 'cause it is so transparent, it will work. Okay, maybe there's a, maybe
there's a happy little tree or two that lives out here, right here. I see it. I see it right there. Go out of the brush, back and forth. This is still the black color. All this is done in black. Okay, and maybe, maybe,
maybe there's a friend that lives right there. There it is. (brush scrunches) Okay, and another one right up through there,
wherever you want a tree. In your world, you decide
where the trees are. This one, it just runs all
the way off the canvas. All right, maybe there's just a couple little indications back here. Thanks. Okay, now, let's go back, and we'll pick up a little
of the Van Dyke brown, a little of the gray
color, and let's drop in a few little highlights on this one. Sometimes use the brush sideways. And just make all kinds of beautiful little things happen here. (brush rustles) Okay, maybe, there it is. Just pick out things, drop them in. Wherever. You can do anything, anything. There we go. Maybe there's, maybe there's
a big projection here. Play with these rocks. Boom, boom, boom, boom. I'm using the black color again. Just like so. Make a big old projection out of that. A lot of fun. Now, we bring down some highlight, and just bring it right
up to the edge, like so. Good. Now, I'm gonna take a
little bit of paint thinner and my liner brush, and I'm gonna put it into some permanent red, very thin. There, turn that brush, kiddo. Get a lot of paint on it. All right, let's go
back to the canvas here. Now, I want to just sort of highlight the edges of these stones. So you put it in and then
work it a little bit. There we go. Just put it in, let it work. And maybe, maybe right around here. Just a little of this nice, permanent red, and just blend it in. Make some beautiful little things happen. Sets all this off. Okay, and maybe, on this
first one we did back here, maybe there's just a tiny
little bit of a knit, also. We don't want it to be left out. There we go. Just here and there a little bit. Okay, let's get into the fun part now. Now, it's time to start
playing with the water. I'm gonna take a small
amount of titanium white. Just a small amount, and
we'll go right back here, and I want the water
to look like it's going sort of between these two rocks. So I'm just gonna, just put
in a little color like that. Very, very little. Wipe that knife. There. (knife scratches) I try to keep this fairly straight. You don't want your water to run out of one side, and it will. If it's not straight, your water will look like it's gonna run right
out of the painting. And get your floor wet, and
then, you'll yell at me. (knife scratches) Okay, and that gives us a
nice indication back here of a little bit of
water, and very lightly, with a clean brush, very lightly, we'll just blend over that. Very, very light. Okay, now, let's take a, the old fan brush, and we'll
go right back into my white. And let's have a little wave
back here in the background that's beginning to
crash, and it's coming up. You've gotta make a decision. You gotta make it. Where is it gonna be? Boom, right there. Just let it go. And I'm sliding up brush
and then pushing it to end. Put the highlight on the top. Okay, maybe, maybe,
maybe there's some stones back here that this wave's crashing over. So we'll take some of the black, and let's put a happy
little stone right in here. It's your world, so put your
stone where you want it. Let's see, I've got
several fan brushes going, and it'll save you a lot of washing if you have several brushes. A lot of brush washing. Okay, now, I'm gonna add a
little bit of magic white to my paint, so it's a
tiny, tiny bit thinner. Maybe there's water, water that's coming, put a little bit of blue in there. There we go. Maybe the water is coming over, shoom, over these stones, hitting, splashing. It's running all down
through there, wherever. Waves hitting up against the back. (brush rustles) Now, then in here, there. (brush rustles) And just use this little stroke. See? It gives the impression
that the water is choppy. I guess that's a fair word to use, choppy. I'm bad about making up words, so don't look them up in a dictionary. And they probably won't be there. (brush rustles) It's like the little things
under evergreen trees. I never could figure out
what they were called, so I just call them hangy-downs, and they sort of hang underneath the tree. Okay, let's take a little
bit more of the blue, and maybe, maybe there's a wave that's hitting right, shoo, here. There it is. Wherever you want it. And it sort of curls back,
splashes and crashes. And it's coming from here and coming over. There it comes. Let it come from here and come over. There. Sort of comes up and pushes, whoosh, and it helps make little sounds. Okay, I'm gonna take
the tiniest little bit of the Cad yellow, and I'm gonna just play a little bit right in here. I just want this wave to pick it up. (brush rustles) Just to pick it up, and this is the reason I put the brown under
here rather than blue. It's so this yellow
won't turn bright green. I don't want it to turn totally green. (brush rustles) Okay, a little white involved in it here. Just make it look like foam. We'll want just the little yellowish hue. Right, it looks terrible. I'm in trouble now. All right, now, now, let's
take and pull this water right over the top of
it, right over, pooshoo. Let it crash. (brush rustles) Okay, add a little bit more
blue right in there, toom, and just, this is thalo blue, and just allow these colors to play. Toom. Now, we need to separate it here, so I need a little bit of color. Maybe it's coming almost
straight towards you here. This wave's breaking right there. There we go. (brush rustles) There. Now, we need a dark line. There has to be some
dark color right there to separate these, and let
it play down into the wave. This is a black color, just a little, just enough to separate it, like so. Okay, maybe down in here, we can start playing with some little
watery things, just like so. There we are. I want to have some reflections. So to make reflections, all
we do is just pull it down. Just use the fan brush,
big brush, whatever. Pull straight down, and take a
large brush and pull it down. Just like we're making reflections
in a happy little pond. And then very lightly, go across it. And then, we'll take a little bit of paint and put in a happy little
water line in here. (brush rustles) Pull this straight back. Keep it flat, keep it flat. (brush rustles) Okay, now, let's put some, let's put some little stones in here. Maybe there's a happy
little stone right there. Happy little stone. Everything is happy, and there's one. Wherever you want these little stones. This is sort of like a
California, Oregon type coast. Beautiful, beautiful oceans there, and however many stones you want. Okay, we'll take a little tiny touch here of brown and white. Let's get some brown, and
we'll highlight these stones, just like we did the big ones. Just drop some little highlights on them. Some out here on this one. Wherever. There we go. Now, we can come back in here and put some little watery things. Let's add a little blue to that. There we go, beautiful. There. And we need some crashing
going on in here. (brush rustles) There. (brush rustles) The water is spilling
around all, all over. Okay, let's take the liner brush here with a little bit of paint thinner on it, and I'm gonna go right
into some light color. And let's just do this. Just do a little bit of that. This is paint thinner on the brush. Okay, now then, I'm going into some blue. This is thalo blue with a
little white and paint thinner, and let's put all kinds
of little watery things just dripping over this
rock, just like so. This is your rock, so
wherever you want them. Just let them play. Okay, maybe, maybe there's
some over there, wherever. Just think about where,
in your mind, the water would crash over some of these rocks. And at home, you can really take your time and put a lot of little things in there. Let's take a little bit of the dark color, and right under the edge
here, we'll set this wave up, this foam up, a little bit by just putting a little dark line here. Just a little line. Now, okay, and that should give
you an idea of how you can make a fantastic
seascape in very little time, and it works. It works so, so nice, and I
think you'll enjoy that one. Okay, and I think we'll sign this one. We'll take a little bit of permanent red right on the old liner brush. Bring that brush to a nice, sharp point. Go right up here, and we'll sign it. Glad I have a short name. And with that, we'll call
this painting finished. And from all of us here, we'd like to wish you happy painting. God bless, see you next week. (soothing, gentle music)
