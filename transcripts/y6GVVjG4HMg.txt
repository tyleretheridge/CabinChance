hey it's a fantastic day and I'm glad you're here with me so I tell you what today let's paint a little animated opening that's the one you see at the beginning of each show in this series a little seascape and I'll show you exactly how that one was done let's start out and have run all the colors across the screen that were used to paint that picture while they're doing that let me show you what I've done up here I have my standard old pre-stretch canvas but today I've covered it with a thin even coat of well I guess you'd call this liquid gray I've taken liquid white and liquid black in about equal proportions and covered the entire canvas I've also decided basically where the horizon line will because I want it to be straight in the seascape and I've just put a piece of masking tape across here which will pull off later so tell you what let's get started and let's do a little seascape I'm gonna start today with a small amount of Prussian blue on the two-inch brush Prussian blue this is an overcast looking sky in this particular painting so we'll add a little black to it just mix it on the brush seascapes traditionally or are sort of hard to paint but after I try to show you an easy way of making very effective little seascapes now let's start right up in here just use the little crisscross strokes just begin putting in a little sky there we go like soft very very easy just little X's in the area where the big clouds are going to be we'll just sort of leave that open okay a little more depression blue and the black and let's go to the other side over here there so all there is to it okay then take with just a second when you're using a two inch brush to drop in a happy little sky or today may be a mean little sky now then without cleaning the brush I'm going to get least little touch of alizarin crimson on the bristles just a small amount just a small amount and because there's blue on there that'll turn sort of a lavender color with a little lavender right down here like so okay fantastic a little bit over on this side maybe a little touch more now when you're doing your seascape you put whatever color you want in there and in what degree you may want it brighter or duller whatever whatever whatever makes you happy that's what we are to do okay we've got the start of a nice little sky now that today let's use the one-inch brush and put some clouds in you could put them in with a two inch brush with a fan brush I'll just use a one-inch brush today it doesn't matter whatever makes you happy go through titanium white pull the brush just like so dude low done we'll be right back I'm gonna get the least little touch of cad yellow least little touch a lot of paint in the bristles bristles are fully loaded okay now then let's go right up in here and just using little circular strokes let us just begin laying in some basic shapes basic little shapes maybe around like so now this will not be an exact duplicate of the one that you see at the opening of the show I don't think you could have over 100 years paint exact duplicate it'll show you how it was made and you can make your own at home there we are okay up in here once again little circular strokes and try not to stay in the in the same area and keep working it or you just end up with great big old cotton balls in the sky and we really want we really want to have nice actions up here okay there all right well this is a monster cloud big cloud is gonna be a big storm coming here if you got a little boot you better put it away mmm let's go get washed ride on out maybe over here see okay can we grab a big brush be sure it's dry now using just the corner the brush I'm just sort of stirring it up mixing it up like that very gentle Dever what's at all you can beat the brush just to knock the excess paint out you're gonna pick up a little paint here there we go just knock it out J lambda blended there now very lightly this is two hairs in some air grab it and lift it fluff it tease it pull it mm-hmm make love to it here very gentle very gentle here we go and this paint that I'm using is very firm and very dry and you can do all this blending without it mixing now we just take out the brushstrokes that easy peasy you get well you get a big cloud there a little more of the white on the brush and maybe over here let's have another cloud right up in there see just as many or as few clouds as you want your world just drop them in always using that little circular stroke though and think about think about shape and form here don't just throw them in at random you might luck out but your chances are much better you if you plan it a little bit when you're looking there we are all right yeah that's a lot of clouds in one painting maybe that one comes away up here look at there let's see how easy it was used to a nice traditional painter I used to labor over clouds whoo that's one of the easiest things that there is to do there okay man let's go right over there attend some more happy little clouds and working layers in your mind think which clouds of others to wait and do that one first and work forward forward forward always working forward there may be one right here where you have to make those big decisions and that's what makes painting fun is that you can make decisions and you can create a world that you want there where sometimes we're not totally satisfied with the world the way it is in here if you're not satisfied with the world that you create then you have no one to blame but yourself there we go I think I've mentioned on previous shows I spend half my life in the military and I used to come home take off my little soldier happen but all my painters happen and there I'd build the kind of world that I wanted was peaceful that was quiet there is no hassles nobody was yelling and it was good everything was good nobody was gonna get shot or hurt not my world and it's a happy place but you build the only kind of world that you want there fluff it up lift it to ease it pull it there see just can blend those clouds to any degree of softness that you want but always in big circular strokes like yet you don't want to come straight up it'll look like it's raining up I'm gonna handle usually bother you knock off the excess paint and very lightly once again just blend the entire sky there we are see there we got a fantastic little sky super big clouds okay I can wash this whole brush off now odorless thinner and be sure it's odorless whoo you'll not only run him your whole family off but you run yourself off okay now as I've mentioned earlier I have a little masking tape right here let's pull that off Zoop and we have a very straight horizon line because we put that on there and I'll take a little touch of the let's get a little touch a little touch of color here will just work better I'm just picking up a little bit of that what we call it liquid grey there cause it's whip I'm just working it in yeah okay that's basically all you have to do just working a little bit of color cover up where the tape was that okay and we're in business again and then when I'm doing seascapes we clean this one of the things that I like to do is sort of lay out a basic form for my major wave main reason being where the transparency there that or the eye of the wave is I want that to be light I don't want to start color on there so to do that let's take a little crimson I just use liner brush your crimson little phthalo blue just mix it on the brush you get a little thinner on it there just make sort of a little lavender color it doesn't matter add then come right down here decide where you made your waves going to be maybe that son of a gun is going to go we up here see it's going to break the horizon here come down maybe go over I think that's the way we had it so I'm like so doesn't matter it not off and that's going to come right on out there now right here maybe that'll help right there will be the eye eye the way where the transparency now then we could take a let's take our fan brush we'll go right in here get a little phthalo blue little phthalo blue oppression blue and let's just go right up in here in between here I'm gonna add a little bit of this darker color right in here see all you got to do is just sort of fill it in yeah keep this horizon line quite straight it gets crooked it'll bhadiya and I'm I'm using this fan brush only because I don't want to get in there with a big brush and lose those areas normally we just do this with a big brush there see there speaking a big brush let's get one here we'll get some blue oil and some black and a little touch of the phthalo green very dark and come right down in here right in here there again putting in some color all we're doing here is laying in color very dark sorry light show there that's just the blues black and little green okay we want that maybe about down safe there let's go and cuts about where we had okay alright I'll just take the same old brush i'ma go right into Van Dyck Brown just load some into bristles it really doesn't matter how you loaded this taps I'm in there now that the rest of the canvas I'm gonna fill up with brown van Dyck Brown once again this is just a base color we're going to cover all of this up it really no big deal just our base color don't look like much of a seascape so far it is it but you remember our goal to do we don't make mistakes we have happy accidents so we can turn this into a beautiful painting no matter what cause between the two of us we can do anything there all right and we have our painting blocked in now we can go ahead let me take a little blue a little green this is stay low blue little potato green and I know right here see it's nice because we've already painted this painting I know basically what's going to happen we can take put in where our major waves gonna be here see there just add a little color so there's there pull it over just think about how the waves formed right here that here in there alright yeah let's take her let's take our little filbert brush take some titanium white the least least little touch of CAD yellow least little touch it very small amount let's go right back up here now if this is going to be the eye of our wave our transparency take your filbert and just scrub it using the side of it scrub it firmly and begin working out you're going to start picking up the underneath color let's go and get darker darker darker you work out from that transparency and that's exactly what we want allow the canvas to work for you there we go okay let's have a little more right over here there don't want this one quite as bright as the other one but right in there I'll have a little and in here we're going to have all kind of little foamy things that are happening and you can begin putting in some basic little shapes here just using this brush there all right now be sure this 2 inch brush you we're going to use is clean and dry use just the corner of it just the corner and just just gently gently wiggle it just wiggle it can you see that barely see just barely turning little tiny circular strokes there you go now you can see it better see how that's just coming together that fantastic that you can do that with such a big old brush now we can begin pulling in the shape here that easy that easy and over here we'll blend this one out using just the corner of its brush and I prefer the two inch to the one inch brush for doing this it seems to have more bristles and it makes it smoother there we are okay and then let me find I've got several of each brush going here I'm going back into the crimson and a little bit of blue and it'll make a lavender color here just lizard crimson and little phthalo blue alright let's go back up here and then I'll start I want to add a little shadow right here this is I'm just using the side of the brush think about the foam it's crashing all in here this is the shadow part of the foam that's all we're doing right now tiny little strokes though hope you can see that and just let it go right on the room like so okay clean man now comes the fun part now we want to make this wave crashing over so I'm going to use a fan brush just load some titanium white into it just both sides now think about how the waves is coming up here and is hitting gotta make those little sounds to see wipe your brush off as it picks up the color okay here's another one and don't make it too even this the Syst water is it's churning and it's mad oh it's just raising the devil okay back to my little filbert wipe a pain oh it will take titanium white and the least least little touch of the yellow in it once again okay let's go up here now we want to put some highlights on this so here we just sort of push upward push give it a little upward push and as you pick up that under color reload your brush but new color on it come back look at that look at that didn't it fun what had water is just churning and raising the devil there comes out up to them maybe just sort of ghouls riding off into the distance like an okay number wipe off on the painter and I will come back and very lightly just a clean dry brush again blending that together keep your brushes clean and dry as possible so I've just put a blends together there let me find my big brush again back to the old two-inch brush once again very lightly all you doing is just mixing it up just stirring it up see there and you can make it as smooth this silk just turned up okay I'm gonna take I'm gonna define this edge a little more make it a little bit brighter and make some little things happening in there push so you're when you push upward that's when your foam pattern comes off there all right okay now then we need some waves happen here let's take the small knife I like the small knife for this because it's a little bit thinner a little bit flimsier it bends easier and I need this to be a little roll of paint we're going to start right up in here watch here very firm pressure look here very firm pressure as you run out of paint add a little more paint look at that and that fantastic and and and it comes right on out through here see there but that easy but need a very firm pressure and a good drag paint or you run into problems now you can begin thinking about form and shape here this little knife is fantastic for doing entire seascapes it's unreal what you can do with it it's just absolutely unreal okay tell you what it was so much fun let's do another let's do it on maybe start right about here in the same almost the same spot hmm let it come out okay a lot of pressure bend that knife bend it you want that rigid painter then we got the water coming right up on the shore that easy maybe there's a little more water just wherever I'll let that just sorta blend right on back I'm applying quite a bit of pressure don't be afraid of this get in there do it okay tell you what I'll take some paint thinner I'm gonna go right into the white titanium white with the least least little touch of the yellow on it I just want to Sparkle this edge on this just Sparkle it a little bit then we can bring it right on down there like so and back in here we want to begin putting individual little wave shapes all the way up to the horizon now all these little details in here or what really make the painting exciting and just to sort of use a little motion to put like little waves and that easy you can create the illusion of all kind of little things happening in there let's go on the other side over here see there just throw in a few and right along in here put a few little things these little little foamy things here they really what make your painting spectacular and you can put them in with a liner brush but a few of them in here at home where you have unlimited time it's unbelievable what you can do here if I go over 30 minutes they don't have any sense of humor they yell and scream at me director comes out here says bad things she's mean there now maybe back in here just put some little indications of things happening back in it yeah it gives it just little detail there we go see the more you put in the more interesting it becomes new people thank you work for so long on these all right let's get let's get serious here clean off my palate a little bit let's go into the Van Dyck Brown go and grab a big bunch of paint let's come right up in here I want to take this is your bravery test on this painting I just come right up there you'll put a little bit of land out here there were some palm trees in that painting we need a place for us alright all I'm doing is putting Van Dyke Brown okay let's take some Hawaii some dark sienna it's just plain white dark sienna maybe underneath here colors a little lighter and take your knife and just scrub it let's rub it very hard and you can blend this right in make that Beach just stand out there okay a little bit of black right here maybe there's a look at there see just a little something there to Sparkle it Navin let's begin working so thanks in here we'll take some of the brown and the white lay a little highlight here and I just let that boo boo boo boo boo so a run right over the edge here and there whatever there we go see just let all kind of little things happen in here when you pick up some white I'm get a little touch the bright red the yellows get crazy in here let's put in some beautiful colors on there let these things just happen wherever you want little set green and yellow here and there oh that's nice I like to paint with a palette knife it just makes so many beautiful things happen all right take my fan brush Van Dyck Brown we have a palm tree that lives right there one right here and another one maybe he lives right there now with the paint as thin as water I'm going into straight and Knight black and let's put in just the indication of some leaves here winds blowing oh look I don't go look I don't go see and you just put as many as you want and that's basically how a little animated opening at the beginning of the show is me only takes a minute to do it but it takes a lot of people a long time to make it happen they work very hard okay they will clock on the wall tells me that's about it for the day and I think with that you can see how it was done from all of us here happy painting and god bless Oh ah you
