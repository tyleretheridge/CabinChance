hi I'm glad you could join me today and I thought today we'd do a canvas that's black as you can see that's one of the most enjoyable type paintings that I have ever found in this method of painting so I tell you what let's haven't run all the colors across the screen that you needed home to paint along with me while they're doing that let me tell you what I've done up here I have standard old pre-stretch canvas and while I was going to keep it a secret but I'm going to go ahead and tell you I've put a contact paper Oval on here today and then I've painted the center of this with black gesso allowed that to dry completely and then on top of that I've put a mixture of alizarin crimson and phthalo blue and as it works out from the center I've added more and more blue so it gets darker darker darker as it works out that warmest spot is right here in the center because I'm going to have some little some little floaty clouds and stuff in there and I want that to be nice and bright and I thought today we do a little winter scene something that's a warm and cold at the same time he'll a warm spot in the sky and well let's just do it shoot let's start out the day with a little one-inch brush go right into some titanium white this this is a fantastic painting to do in public if you ever want to get out and amaze your friends and neighbors school up here don't let them see you put all the color on the canvas because we have all these transparent colors on here it still looks black and don't tell your friends and neighbors that you've done this and then when you come up here with your brush and you say well let's just do a little something right here they oh they just go crazy because this color just comes alive so yet beautiful lavender that's happening right there and I'm just taking the brush and doing like so and as we work further out it's going to get darker and darker and darker there we go still using a little rocking stroke to a column just like so darker and darker darker as it works away from that light spot there now you can do this as many times as you want to achieve a desired lightness but I would suggest strongly that each time you wash the brush beat it dry and start with clean color otherwise you're going to drag that dirty color right back into your light area I don't think you're going to be happy with that so if this is our light area always start there now we can begin working outward outward see let it get darker and darker and darker as it works away there see dark or dark dark there we are now you have to make a decision in your world how bright do you want the sky maybe you want it darker than this or lighter it's a strictly an individual thing I just want to show you how you can make some fantastic effects using a few crazy brushes and oh we have very limited palette today we're not using many colors I want to show you how you can do a fantastic little painting just easy easy now with a 2 inch brush I'm gonna gently blend this together just blend it together and all those little rocking strokes that you made you begin to see all kinds of little happy things that they make out here okay let me clean the brush one more time we just use odorless paint thinner there we go go right back into my white let's come right up here maybe maybe right in here watch here watch here still using that same little stroke maybe just comes right on around this make it look like is a big strong floater living up here in the sky just wherever you want a feel don't overdo though just one or two is plenty now that vector big blending brush and very lightly very lightly see we can just blend that big old cloud radio that's something you can see that son-of-a-gun curve or right around and go right into the center and by allowing you to get bigger on this end it makes it look like this parts closer to you the other parts farther away okay and maybe in our world let's see your optics phthalo blue lizard crimson a little black in there too what the heck okay let me find a brush here there's one you'll use a little fan brush maybe the in our world here there lives a little cloud he just sort of floats around here and has fun all day the sort of lady that he'd come right off your brush wherever you want him to live that's exactly where he should be there he is and he's he's just a happy little cloud give it a little bit of blending tiny bit now we're gonna give you your bravery test so you come right here very lightly go across very very lightly look at that and you've got a beautiful little cloud floating around in your sky okay you passed the bravery test I'm just gonna use that same color same color pull it out flat cut across and we get our little roll of paint right on the edge of the knife maybe in our world there lives beautiful little mountain right up here in the sky so that's where we're putting there is see maybe there's a little tube up there where everyone maybe another little bump I really push that paint right into the fabric gets strong let it get tough we'll take our 2 inch brush grabbed it and pull it just pull it grab it here and pull say there there we go and by using the brush strokes here you can sort of lay out your whole mountain and get an idea of where you want highlights and shadows to be without being committed you can change it like there you can change it a hundred times I hope you can see those little brush strokes see here I didn't end fantastically of laying at your Mountain and if they don't show up well and you sit when you're doing this you'll understand exactly what I'm saying I don't take some titanium white I'm gonna add the least little touch of black into it just I want to dull it a little bit so it's not pure white I just want to dull it down gray it a little pulled out as flat as we can get it cut across and we have our little world of pain again see it's important you pull it out and cut that little roll of paint off they have no pressure no Oh pressure that that little sign of again just sort of float there maybe we'll have another little bit goes right out here it just disappears there comes a little right now sometimes it feels so good it hurts there there we go couldn't painting do nice things for you though I'd love to paint it's one of the few things in my life I've never never became bored with because uh I don't think you ever mastered if you live to be a thousand years old you'll always know that your next painting is gonna be better maybe that's the challenge of it that's why it's so fascinating to me now let's let's put some shadows in there for that we'll use some white little pression blue I mix him up there we her cut off her a little roll of paint always that little roll of paint put a little shadow tune right back here come right along here push that one back what power you push mountains around why would I go home I keep pushing but the garbage but here I I can push anything that's the only thing I'm in charge of at home if it sets and waits for me but it's nice to be needed there we are okay but a shadow that lives right here there good clean dry brush be sure it's dry it's not dry it's gonna smoosh it oh I forgot a shadow you let me do that didn't even holler at me right here we need to tie in this little indication of a shadow there yeah we're all right down see if I forget that somebody wrote and told me all I'm doing is beating the paint off the breasts brush brush hmm want to create that misty effect down here at the base very lightly lift upward softly softly over here so there this side of the mountain follow these angles I'll always follow the angles tap a little there blend it up petal mountains just lay enough to float in the mist now you can play games and have fun mountains are older fantastic let's take a little more white come right up here and maybe in our world their lives yep you're right another little Ridge or mountain right in the foreground see by blending and creating that misty effect right there now this mountain will separate and become an individual there's no doubt in your mind when you look at this that is in the foreground but it wasn't that little misty area in there did you do I have to wonder you might figure yeah it is no it's not whatever but by creating a little bit of mist now you know it separates look at that it didn't keep on till you covered your whole canvas with a layer after layer of mountain and that's not bad it's a super super nice way to learn just knock off that excess Pete carry her yeah once again creature mist on this one now you could put another range of mountains in here and another and another and as many as you want there we are very soft very nice okay I have it enough mountains let's do something else I'm gonna take some black depression blue Mazal mix us up a nice power here alizarin crimson shoot we throw some Van Dyck Brown or - it doesn't matter so we have black blue crimson and brown when I clean my knife and we grabbed a sole fan brush that was our cloud making brush it didn't matter well as it has color on a dark color that may be back in here their lives in our world some little distant trees that are far away that because they're dark against this light-colored mountain they'll stand out there we'll just let them go right on over we don't know where they go they just go okay now I wanted to get a little larger on this end so it'll give the impression that this is going away they're too bad they're whatever we don't care who you want yeah then I have several old fan brushes going I'm gonna take the least little touch of a light color this is just little white I want to touch right at the base and lift upward right at the base so it looks like just hundreds of little trunks living back here if they come out a little too bright in your painting all you have to do is rub them to pick up a dark color it's underneath and automatically he'll get tired or dark and darker as it blends together there that's just enough to set it out a little bit tell you what we have that color go right into right into some titanium white and maybe underneath here there's just some happy little snow covered ice covered little bushes and stuff so just push upward may cut brush pinned up written they're just one layer after another however many you want to do to to do K yeah yeah we find a clean brush that one's clean enough for our use we'll take just a small amount of titanium white on the large brush I want to create the illusion of some reflections under here there's color on the canvas all you need is white grab it and pull down straight down it's important that you pull straight down straight down okay now that's mixing with that wet color this underneath and very lightly just blend didn't ya then were you so we use some liquid white ties pull it out flat right on your palate I'm head least little touch of fatal blue to it just cool it down a little pull that very flat cut across and have a teeny little roll of paint on all is just so small and very firmly very firmly I sort of lay the knife down as you go so it gets all the paint that's on the knife push very firmly down and you can make just all kinds of little things happen there okay well we got a nice painting going today everyone so well things just work beautifully let's take our old fan brush and go right back right back in that same dark color and let's make a happy evergreen and he lives right about there back and forth there he goes who read over the mountain there he goes well we know that mountains back here if anybody asks you just tell them herself and tastic Mountain lives right behind this tree you saw it in there let's give him a little friend lives right there we don't want him to be left behind there hey there's a couple trees hope you see these they're very dark very dark maybe yeah we've messed up the mountain so bad why not put one right across him there he comes now you go to pick up a lot of that white if when you're doing this at home if you have trouble making the paint stick over the top of all that white I'm not don't seem to be having too much trouble but if you do take a little paint thinner add a little paint thinner to your color and the thin paint will stick much easier right on top of all the snow and everything on there make you laugh a little easier sometime okay let's take off go to a 1 inch brush here I'm gonna go in to what am I gonna go into here we're going to some grab a little white shoot there something a little blue I'm looking for a pretty dark blue color there pull the brush in one direction firmly I want to round one corner see how round the corner looks now we hit up here that corner that corner is going to be to the top push upward there and by pushing upward it makes all those little leafy looking things happen we'll bring that down that liked it and all we're doing once again it's just throwing in some dark colors so our light color will show up okay and then we can take another 1 inch brush and I'll dip it into the liquid white pull it through titanium white the liquid white is only on there to make the paint a little thinner so it'll stick that's only reason it's on there now don't put all kinds of little snow-covered frosty bushes in here just some pretty little things should look like lace do one little bush at a time Jack Frost as soon as a waved as one and magic has happened here beautiful maybe right there I have another one well you know if he was out here this would be a nice spot but you get cold out here so maybe maybe we should have us a little cabin out here so we get set by the fire and look at this beautiful scene and be warm someone take the knife and scrape out a basic cabin shape just take the knife we just put a little a little cabin maybe there was a there was a trapper that lived out here years ago and this is all this left of his little cabin can you take a little Van Dyke Brown and do the back Eve so that's all there is to it now for the other side of the roof I must go to use titanium white Snow's on yet you get the little knife it comes in a little handy for getting in these little spots take a little brown this is little dark sienna little van Dyck Brown there we go see just pulled in our basic little cabin shape basic shape is all we're looking for at this point little dark sienna and height still using the small knife just barely grazing the canvas touch and pull it down will make the front of this cabin a little brighter now we can take just make the indication here and there a few boards it's a rough cabin take the knife cut off our cabin do a cabin ectomy it's just the way we want it take a little bit of Van Dyck Brown put us in a little door you got to have a little door people always yell at me cuz I never put chimneys on my cabin so just use a small knife put on chimney on that one we take a least little touch of crimson there just but there's nobody home so there's snow on top of chimney I normally don't bother to ever put chimneys and I get people write me and say boy that poor guys freezing to death now give that give that poor fella our chimney so today we did take a little titanium white let's just put the indication of a little bit of a little snow path down there where he can walk keen back to my brush that has liquid height and titanium white and we can continue to put some happy little bushes right in here when you touch it canvas give it a little upward push just a little upward push there we go now I see something that I should do on this cabin here on the other side the roof I didn't put any snow over there and there would be a layer of snow there and it'll just make it look a little better and it also makes your cabin stand out okay in these bushes here in their place once crepe through just put the indication a few little sticks and twigs and all kinds of little things let a few hang right over the path and pushes that path down into the painting mark where do you think they should be can you find me a fan brush there's one oh here's one it's already dirty I'm gonna take this is white with little phthalo blue in it okay let's go red up here I won't put the indication here and there of a little bit of snow on these trees don't want much because I don't want to lose that beautiful contrast so I suggest white with a little touch of a little blue in it there this sort of makes those limbs stand out a little bit arms on a tree what looks cold better get you big Alaskan Parker out that lives in Alaska just to where mukluks those would make canvas boots that come we of them for their fantastic they keep you from freezing to death like them okay tell you how I must do let's bring the camera right up here close and I'm gonna pull the contact paper off and let's take a look at what we have hmm I see I didn't paint the canvas I left the canvas white so when you pull this son of a gun off why does it stand out I mean it really stands out but now when you're doing this at home maybe you want us to paint this a different color like a light blue or a tan or anything that that makes you feel good there's a there's a million different things you can do and I use a lot of ovals only because it's a nice shape to work with but I have letters from people who are using octagons and squares and just any shape that the mind can imagine and when you're doing yours sort of look make a determination one of the things that I found placemats are excellent for getting shapes I used placemats and lay it on the contact paper and take an exacto knife or something and cut around it and then glue it on but that works very very well okay I'm going right back in to that dark color that I had a lot a lot of paint into the bristles and may me and our world here let's let this one tree just this one tree has only what I want escape he's going to slip right out of the bounds of this oval and live right up here there he is just that one little tree there we'll take we'll take some of our phthalo blue and white and if you have trouble making this stick add a little bit of the liquid white to it that'll make it a little thinner and it'll stick we can come back in here just throw a few little highlights mm okay yeah go into a touch of the touch of the paint thinner right into some titanium white and I'm gonna load this liner brush full of color just this is very thins like ink roll the brush brings it to a nice sharp point and maybe hearing there let's just put a happy little stick or two that's all frost to you Oh Jack Frost is really worked on these two just two now don't don't go too well with too many of them don't look right and maybe up through here you can make out a little ones these little details they're nice there we go I think we got to the point we can call this one finished inside it I'm gonna take a little red then it down with thinner and let's sign this one right about here sincerely hope you've enjoyed this one huh it'll show you how much fun you could have using some black gesso little contact paper and imagination and from all of us here happy painting and God bless you
